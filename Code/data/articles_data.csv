0,Spain coronavirus: Drive-through funerals in Madrid,Scott Mclean,"Madrid, Spain (CNN) Every 15 minutes or so, a dark hearse pulls up in front of the crematorium of Madrid's sprawling La Almudena cemetery.

Father Edduar, a Catholic priest dressed for Mass, walks out of the building to greet family members who have come to pay their final respects -- by national rule, each group is limited to five or fewer people. The driver opens the trunk to reveal a simple wooden casket. Standing behind the hearse, under a shaded carport, the mourners keep a distance. Some wear masks , or even gloves. Hugs and kisses are an uncommon sight.

From start to finish, the blessings and prayers take barely five minutes. Father Edduar douses the sealed casket with holy water before a pair of staff emerge to load it onto a gurney and roll it inside. Then, it's all over. There is no eulogy, no visitation, no public burial. There's hardly even time for a goodbye.

2,They used to sell food to top chefs. Now you're their best customer,Hanna Ziady,"London (CNN Business) Millions of restaurants have been shuttered as the novel coronavirus rips around the world, leaving their suppliers with a huge challenge: find new customers, or close up shop.

Fruit and vegetable wholesalers that sold fresh produce to top restaurants in London and New York City before the coronavirus outbreak are overhauling their business models and selling direct to the public.

Fortunately for them, demand for home-cooked meals has never been higher. Grocery sales in the United Kingdom jumped 20% in March to a record £10.8 billion ($13.3 billion), according to data provider Kantar, as consumers rushed to stock their pantries.

With some supermarket shelves empty and online grocery delivery services overwhelmed, restaurant suppliers are finding plenty of new buyers among the general public.

David Visick, director of communications at the UK Federation of Wholesale Distributors, said that as many as 70 of its members have set up home delivery services. Many of their customers are buying groceries online for the first time, he said, adding that some businesses are even taking orders by telephone from older customers.

Reynolds, a family-owned greengrocer that supplies some of the United Kingdom's leading restaurant chains and pubs, said it launched a click and collect service from which consumers happily bought avocados and eggs in packs of 18 and 180, respectively.

It has since come up with smaller packages and launched home deliveries, but the wave of stockpiling enabled it to offload fresh produce in bulk that would ordinarily have gone to restaurants like Pizza Express and Pret A Manger, said project associate Nick Reynolds.

Smith & Brock typically supplies luxury hotels such as London's Hotel Café Royal and The Lanesborough, as well as Michelin-starred restaurants like Le Gavroche. Now, the company has gone from taking a handful of orders from households over WhatsApp to delivering nearly 1,200 boxes of fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy products a day, enabling it to hire back workers that it had been forced to furlough.

Natoora, a business that sells winter tomatoes from Sicily and radicchio from Veneto to upmarket restaurants in London, Paris, Milan and New York — Eleven Madison Park and Per Se among them — said it is on track to replace all the revenue it would otherwise have lost.

Boxes of fresh fruit and vegetables are pictured inside the warehouse of Natoora.

The company signed up more than 30,000 customers for home deliveries in less than two weeks, founder Franco Fubini told CNN Business.

Deliveries are booked up more than a week in advance in London and New York, where Natoora is signing up several hundred new customers a day. At a time of mass layoffs elsewhere, the company is recruiting just to keep up with demand.

British fisherman are getting in on the action, too. ""We had 4,500 signups from two Instagram posts,"" said Ben King, founder of Pesky Fish, an online marketplace that typically connects UK fishermen directly with restaurants and fishmongers in London. Its daily sales to households in the city now outstrip what it was doing in a week pre-coronavirus, King said.

The hope is that these sales will keep fishermen in business until restaurants reopen. Export prices for fish caught in English waters slumped as much as 80% after lockdowns were imposed in Spain and Italy, leaving some boats unable to go to sea because they couldn't cover the cost of their fuel, King said.

For most wholesalers, home deliveries will not replace all their revenue or save them from having to temporarily layoff workers, but it will enable them to continue buying produce from the farms and other businesses that supply them. ""It's about getting some cash into the business,"" said Visick. ""They can't survive forever like this.""

Will home deliveries last?

Once consumers get used to having fresh produce delivered directly to their front door, their shopping and eating habits could change permanently.

""Over the next 12 to 24 months, the level of demand in the home for fresh food is going to be higher than it was six months ago irrespective of what happens to restaurants,"" said Natoora's Fubini. ""I think people are going to find more joy in cooking and eating at home, and are going to embed it as a habit in their lives.""

Hello Fresh, the meal kit delivery company, said in a statement that it expects revenue for the first quarter to be more than 60% higher than the same period in 2019 due to increased customer demand.

Fubini said that Natoora plans to keep the new customers it's won even after the pandemic fades. ""We need to figure out how we do that effectively. We're obviously very committed to the restaurants,"" he added.

If the current crisis changes consumers' buying behavior and helps out fishermen in the long term, ""it will be an amazing silver lining on a dark cloud,"" said King.

""I'm sure when the ban is lifted people will want to get out and enjoy having a glass of wine and something nice to eat,"" said Smith & Brock co-founder Joe Fowler. But, he added, people might choose to buy more of their fresh produce from local suppliers. ""Provided the demand is there we will keep doing home deliveries,"" he said.

4,Bernie Sanders Quits White House Race,Joshua Caplan,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced the suspension of his 2020 presidential campaign on Wednesday morning, paving the way for former Vice President Joe Biden to become the Democrat Party’s White House nominee.

Sanders announced his decision to depart the race during a conference call with staffers and addressed supporters regarding the move shortly after.

“I wish I could give you better news but I think you know the truth,” Sanders said. “I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful and so today I am announcing the suspension of my campaign.”

“While this campaign is coming to an end, our movement is not,” he added.

Sanders also called Biden “a very decent man” and revealed that he will remain on the ballot in remaining states to gain delegates in an effort to “continue working to assemble, as many delegates as possible at the Democratic Convention, where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform.”

The Vermont senator’s decision comes as the U.S. is racing to combat the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. The ongoing pandemic caused both Sanders and Biden to campaign virtually and delayed primary elections across the country.

The move also follows a series of crushing losses in key primary states, which prompted Sanders to reassess the viability of his campaign.

President Trump took to social media to blame failed 2020 candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for Sanders’ failure and invited his supporters to join the Republican Party.

“Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday!” the president tweeted. “This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!”

Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2020

Sanders amassed the most votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, which opened primary voting, and cruised to an easy victory in Nevada — seemingly leaving him well positioned to sprint to the Democratic nomination while a deeply crowded and divided field of alternatives sunk around him.

But a crucial endorsement of Biden by influential South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, and a subsequent, larger-than-expected victory in South Carolina, propelled the former vice president into Super Tuesday, when he won 10 of 14 states.

In a matter of days, his top former Democratic rivals lined up and announced their endorsement of Biden. The former vice president’s campaign had appeared on the brink of collapse after New Hampshire but found new life as the rest of the party’s more moderate establishment coalesced around him as an alternative to Sanders.

Things only got worse the following week when Sanders lost Michigan, where he had campaigned hard and upset Clinton in 2016. He was also beaten in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho the same night and the results were so decisive that Sanders headed to Vermont without speaking to the media.

The coronavirus outbreak essentially froze the campaign, preventing Sanders from holding the large rallies that had become his trademark and shifting the primary calendar. It became increasingly unclear where he could notch a victory that would help him regain ground against Biden.

Though he will not be the nominee, Sanders was a key architect of many of the social policies that dominated the Democratic primary, including a “Medicare for All” universal, government-funded health care plan, tuition-free public college, a $15 minimum wage and sweeping efforts to fight climate change under the “Green New Deal.”

5,Chinese Official Claiming U.S. Army Made Coronavirus Defends WHO,Frances Martel,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who blamed the U.S. Army for the Chinese coronavirus last month, told reporters on Wednesday that President Donald Trump potentially cutting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) would “seriously undermine” response to the pandemic.

Zhao also claimed that WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is not a medical doctor, has led the WHO in “earnestly fulfilling its duties, upholding an objective, scientific and fair stance, and playing an important role in coordinating international efforts.” Support for Tedros from Beijing comes after weeks of mounting criticism and calls from the general public and from members of Congress for the WHO chief to resign.

Tedros has repeatedly demanded the world applaud China’s efforts to contain the virus – despite studies blaming the Communist Party’s censorship of doctors who identified it correctly as a communicable disease for as many as 95 percent of the world’s infections. Under his leadership, the WHO relayed false Chinese information saying the virus was not spreading from human to human, repeatedly urged countries not to limit entry to travelers from China, and chose to disregard early warnings from the government of Taiwan, which the WHO does not recognize, of the severity of the outbreak.

In contrast with this reality, Zhao affirmed that the WHO under Tedros “has won recognition and acclaim from all over the world.”

“China will continue supporting the WHO in fulfilling its work and playing a leading role in global anti-pandemic cooperation,” the spokesman promised, before warning Trump not to cut funding for the United Nations agency.

“As the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] spreads rapidly across the world, the US ‘putting a hold on US funding to WHO’ will seriously undermine the organization’s normal functioning as well as international anti-pandemic cooperation,” Zhao predicted. “We hope countries can work together, help each other amid difficulties and jointly contribute to the global fight against the coronavirus.”

Zhao has continued to represent the Chinese Foreign Ministry after outraging the world with an unsubstantiated accusation in March that the United States Army developed the Chinese coronavirus and spread it deliberately in Wuhan.

“When did patient zero begin in US?” Zhao wrote on Twitter, a social media outlet the Communist Party has banned Chinese citizens from using. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent”:

2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 12, 2020

Twitter has not removed the post, and expressed that it would not censor Chinese regime disinformation on the platform.

The Global Times, a Chinese communist propaganda newspaper, speculated that an Army facility in Maryland developed the virus.

At press time, no evidence exists tying the Chinese coronavirus to the United States military or America in any way. Scientific consensus indicates the virus originated in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Most theories suggest it infected its first human victim through the consumption of wild animal meat.

Zhao’s remarks on Wednesday were a response to President Trump calling the WHO “very China-centric” and publicly mulling cutting funding for the agency.

“The W.H.O. really blew it,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China-centric. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?”

During his daily coronavirus briefing later that day, Trump said he was considering no longer funding the agency.

“We want to look into the World Health Organization because they really called it wrong,” Trump told reporters. “They missed the call, they could have called it months earlier, they would have known, they should have known, and they probably did know.”

“They seem to be very China-centric,” he continued. “That’s a nice way of saying it, but they seem to be very China-centric, and they seem to err always on the side of China.”

“I’m not saying I’m going to do it. But we’re going to look at it,” the president said of defunding the agency.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, appeared to support Trump’s consideration during a television appearance on Tuesday.

“In the next appropriations bill, there’s not going to be any money for the WHO. I’m in charge of the appropriations subcommittee. I’m not going to support funding the WHO under its current leadership,” Graham said. “They’ve been deceptive, they’ve been slow, and they’ve been Chinese apologists. I don’t think they’re a good investment, under the current leadership, for the United States.”

The United States provided just slightly over 14 percent of the WHO’s funding in 2018-2019. The American government was the agency’s single largest source of funds. The second-largest, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is also run by Americans.

China provided the WHO with 0.21 percent of its funding that year.

6,Trump’s Economic Approval Rating Hits Highest Level Ever,John Carney,"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown the American economy into a deep contraction and sent unemployment soaring but Americans approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis.

Approval of President Trump’s handling of the economy rose to 52 percent, the highest level of his presidency, CNBC’s “All America” survey showed Wednesday. That is up from 49 percent in December.

The survey of 800 Americans was taken between Friday and Monday.

Trump’s overall approval rating jumped as well, to 46 percent from 40 percent. That too is the best ranking of the Trump presidency.

Trump is even scoring higher marks from Democrats. His job approval rating rose to 20 percent among Democrats, a record high and up from 8 percent in December.

The high marks are all the more notable because the survey also reveals that ten percent of Americans say they lost their jobs because of the outbreak. Another 16 percent have had their pay cut.

Forty-five percent of Americans rate the economy as poor. Twenty-two percent rate it as “fair,” making for a combined 77 percent taking a dim view of the economy. That’s up 20 points from December and the worst of Trump’s presidency. Such pessimism was common, however, during Barack Obama’s presidency.

The survey’s results show that the economic contraction due to the virus has been severe but Americans remain optimistic. Fifty-one percent say they expect the economy to improve in the next year. Forty-nine percent expect the economy to return to normal in the next few months. Just six percent think the effects of the shutdown will last longer than a year.

Only one percent of Americans say they expect to lose their job in the next few weeks, suggesting that Americans think the worst of the shutdown’s damage to the labor market may be over. A further eight percent expect that they will suffer a pay cut in the next few weeks.

Americans are not blaming President Donald Trump for Trump’s job rating rose in the poll, with more Americans approving of his handling of the presidency than disapproving for the first time in the three years it’s been tracked by CNBC. His approval rating jumped to 46% from 40% in December, with a 6-point decline in disapproval to 43%.","Approval of President Trump’s handling of the economy rose to 52 percent, the highest level of his presidency, CNBC’s “All America” survey showed Wednesday.

7,Fauci: We Should Start to See ‘Beginning of a Turnaround’ Beyond This Week — ‘A Good Sign’,Trent Baker,"Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday addressed the ongoing fight to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

Fauci shared in that at this time, the White House coronavirus task force is seeing “glimmers of hope” because, as bad as this week will predictably be for deaths, the American public should start to see “the beginning of a turnaround” soon.

“[A]s you correctly reported, the number of deaths on a given day continue to increase,” Fauci told “America’s Newsroom.” “You know, at the same time, seemingly paradoxically but not, we’re saying that we’re starting to see some glimmers of hope because the deaths generally lag by a couple of weeks behind what’s fueling the outbreak, namely the number of new cases and the number of hospitalizations. So, at the same time as we’re seeing an increase in death, like typically what we’re seeing now from New York, over the last few days, there’s been a stabilization and a decrease in the hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care and the requirements for intubations. That means that as we get further on, beyond this week, we should start to see the beginning of a turnaround, which is a good sign.”

He continued, “So, you know, it’s very sobering to see the increase in deaths. And we predicted over the weekend that this would really be a bad week. And it is. It’s going to be a bad week for deaths. But driving that and ahead of that is the fact that we’re going to start to see the beginning of a turnaround. So we need to keep pushing on the mitigation strategies because there’s no doubt that that’s having a positive impact on the dynamics of the outbreak.

8,Kamala Harris: ‘People Are Dying’ Because of Trump’s ‘Vacuum of Leadership’,Pam Key,"Wednesday on ABC’s “The View,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said President Donald Trump’s “vacuum of leadership” has caused American lives in the coronavirus pandemic.

When asked if Trump bears some of the responsibility for the loss of American lives, Harris said, “The buck stops with him, you know, here’s the thing, this is a moment of international crisis, and this is when leaders must lead. The president of the United States was also the commander-in-chief, in a moment of crisis, which is a public pandemic that has led to an economic crisis as well. The president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, must use the voice of that office in a way that is about speaking truth, embracing fact, speaking about facts, no matter how uncomfortable it may make people to hear. It is about embracing science and listening to the public health professionals all with the intention of lifting up the American people, both in terms of dealing with the solutions to this problem, which means acknowledging it is a real serious issue and not a hoax, which means saying that one of the tools in the tool belt of the president in a crisis is to use the Defense Production Act, to require that where we don’t have what we need to meet the crisis and meet the moment, we will create incentives and direction to the private sector to create those things, in this case, ventilators, masks, tests.”

She continued, “What we have in this president is someone who has been concerned about himself full-time since he has been in office and including during this pandemic. And so we have heard — frankly, and I have to be candid, we’re in the middle of a pandemic. We have heard lies. We have heard him try to shift blame.”

She added, “At a national level, and in particular from the administration, we’ve seen a vacuum of leadership, and we’re paying a price for it. And as to your point, people are dying.”

Wisconsin voted Tuesday in the midst of a pandemic that shuttered polling places and funneled voters into long lines and highly trafficked polling stations. In Milwaukee, which normally has 180 polling places, only five opened their doors.

The primary election happened after a high-stakes and fast-moving battle between the Democratic governor and Republicans in the legislature. On Monday, Gov. Tony Evers ordered the election delayed until June. Republicans immediately protested, taking the matter to the state Supreme Court, which quickly blocked Evers’ order. Less than an hour later, the U.S. Supreme Court hit voters again, discarding tens of thousands of absentee ballots that were not mailed out in time. Wisconsinites who hadn’t received their ballots in time would instead have to cast their votes in person.

On Tuesday, as much of the rest of the country sheltered in place, many Wisconsin voters left their homes to congregate at polling places. Many others, unwilling to take on such a risk, stayed home.

Slate spoke to five voters who went to their polling places on Tuesday to ask them what it was like to vote during a pandemic. They are:

David Meyer, 29, the front desk coordinator of a hotel (currently shut down) in Green Bay.

Nicole Winters, 50, the Milwaukee-based operations manager for the civic engagement nonprofit Wisconsin Voices.

Dwayne, 25, an employee at a dairy company in Madison (who declined to give his last name in order to speak freely without worrying about his employer’s approval).

John Marszalkowski, 38, a stay-at-home father of two in Milwaukee.

Mia Noel, 35, the program manager of a youth health education organization in Milwaukee.

Their answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Slate: How did you end up voting in person today?

David: I had been following along with other states in the Midwest. A lot of those states had been pushing back their election dates, so I figured ours would get pushed back until it’s a safer time. And I [didn’t request a mail-in ballot] because I’m more in favor of in-person voting, seeing it go into the machine.

Nicole: I want to go in person because the last election, when I went to my voting site, the doors were locked and I did not get to cast my vote. So I made it a point: Today, I would go in person if it was allowed.

Dwayne: I requested [my absentee ballot] online last week. They immediately said I needed to submit a voter ID. I am already a registered voter. I voted twice already in Wisconsin. So I digitally submitted my ID. I got mail Monday night saying that they did not accept my ID. I used my driver’s license—I’m from Louisiana [originally]—and they told me an out-of-state driver’s license is not a valid form of ID, but I could still vote at a county clerk’s office or a polling place.

John: On March 20, I filled out [the request] for the absentee ballot because I figured that’s the safest way to do this. In Milwaukee, we had some options last weekend where you could go downtown and vote from your car. But I thought, well, the safest thing is if my ballot is in the mail. So I stayed home. And it never showed.

Mia: I requested an absentee ballot in the middle of March, and it never came. I tried to do the drive-up early voting in Milwaukee. But the line for that was eight blocks long. I had an argument with my partner about voting in person. He said, “It’s not just you, it’s also me.” But the thing for me is there’s stuff on the ballot I wanted to participate in. Increased public school funding. Local county executive races and the mayoral race. It was still important for me to vote.

What was the voting process like?

David: Green Bay is a city of about 105,000 people, and there were two polling precincts today. It was a really long process to get from start to finish. I arrived at 8:54 a.m. and left at 11:34. When I left, people were waiting in a far longer line. So they’re looking at at least four-, maybe five-hour wait times to go vote. There were a couple people around me that left. One gentleman had to catch a bus, and another was an essential worker who had to get to work. [An election official at one point] offered the older people to come inside to sit, as long as they remembered their place in line.

Most of us brought our own pens; that was the recommendation, that you bring your own black or blue pen from home. And then they had a large wooden or plexiglass-constructed thing that looked like it had been built for the sole purpose of voting today. You would place your identification on the outside of the plexiglass, and the workers inside went through the rolls and saw what ward you were in, and we would go to our assigned area that had the ballot for our particular ward. And then we had one person come through and sanitize the area after people left. There were probably about 10 poll workers there in total. For a city of our size, that’s not a lot.

Nicole: When I got there, there was a note on the door that said I had to go to a different location 2.3 miles away. Parking was not very easy. I walked around the whole school grounds to get to where we had to go in and vote. But the line did go fast. There were people outside that directed you where to go to get registered and asked you if you knew your ward. If not, they looked your address up. They were passing out gloves and ink pens. When we got inside, they would call you up and have you lay your ID on the table. They did wipe them down after every person, and they did have on masks and gloves. I didn’t touch anything other than putting my ballot on the desk to fill it out. It maybe took 45 minutes to an hour.

Dwayne: It was not very busy. I live in downtown Madison, which is a pretty enfranchised area. Pretty white, pretty middle-class. They had a lot of workers. They looked me up—I was in the voter registration book. And I gave them my ID. They were like, “We cannot accept that.” I brought my birth certificate, my Social Security card, and a bill that goes to my address. I voted here before, with the same people. So I didn’t understand why it’s a problem. I don’t know why they’re being more strict about it. I was basically turned around until one of the poll workers called the municipal clerk and got more information. They said I could vote and then have a couple days to get an ID. The problem with that is the DMV is very far away. The other places where I could get an ID are closed right now because of the shutdown. So it was very inconvenient. I felt disenfranchised.

John: I arrived shortly after 8 a.m. I was outside for a long time, and then there was a line going down the high school hallway and back up. The woman in front of me in line was visibly exhausted, bracing herself on the walls, grabbing anything she can to take weight off her feet. People are just crammed in this low-ventilation hallway, no windows or anything. They had X’s taped on the floor to try to indicate 6 feet apart. Six feet seems like a lot until you cram 100 people in a hallway.

Once I got through the line, there were a lot of volunteers. They were very friendly and patient. They were working hard to keep the tables clean. They had people with disinfectant bottles, and they were wiping down the tables where you showed your ID, but I didn’t notice them wiping down the booths. After turning in my ballot, they offered me some hand sanitizer on the way out.

Mia: I got ready to face being in line for hours around other people. I put on gloves and a mask. You had to park far away and walk to the end of the line between six and seven blocks from the polling station. By the time we got to the front, the high school gym was very orderly. They had X’s so everyone would stay 6 feet apart. The poll workers did a great job at making sure we were as safe as possible. All poll workers had some sort of protective equipment. The whole process was smooth. It took me about 2½ hours to [vote].

How do you feel coming out of the experience? Did you at any point think you might not vote?

David: I think it’s pretty embarrassing. They were putting political power way ahead of human well-being and human life. I hope and pray that nobody gets sick and dies from our election taking place today.

I had the mindset that no matter how long the wait was, no matter what the weather situation was, I would vote because I felt like it was an active choice that a group of people made to try to suppress votes and to try to minimize the voice of the people in Wisconsin. And I didn’t think that was OK.

Nicole: It wasn’t bad. It was good to see people out voting.

Dwayne: I felt really bad. I’m an essential worker. I ride transit every day to work. I didn’t want to expose more vulnerable people to what I’m already being exposed to at work. So I had this thing in the back of mind: “What other precautions do I have to take to go do this thing that I really want to do, which is vote?”

I really didn’t like that I had to make that choice. It was deeply painful. But this seemed like it was important enough to risk. I’m an African American. I’m originally from the South. I have family who fought for enfranchisement for so long. I know my people’s history with voting rights. I know the electoral process can be disheartening at times, I know that it is not the only way to effect change, but I think it has a deep and symbolic meaning to black people in general. And I think it means a lot to see us at the polls. I feel empowered when I go.

John: It was very frustrating, because I’ve been working so hard—my whole family’s been working hard—to stay home, social distance, avoid going to the store, and do everything I can to do what I’m supposed to do. And [yet] I also have this sense of civic duty to participate in the election.

Mia: I’m still just very frustrated that this happened. I hope there’s not a spike in cases after this. I’m worried I could be part of that. I’ve been working so hard to stay home and make sure our health care system has a chance to cope with any cases that come up. And then to be forced into an unfair decision about whether to leave is frustrating. I’m really angry.","Wisconsin voted Tuesday in the midst of a pandemic that shuttered polling places and funneled voters into long lines and highly trafficked polling stations.

10,Rikers Reports First Coronavirus Death as Legal Aid Calls for Prisoner Release,Julia Craven,"An aerial view of the Rikers Island prison in New York City. Debra L. Rothenberg/WireImage

Michael Tyson’s last days began as part of New York’s usual correctional routine: On Feb. 28, the 53-year-old was locked up in the Rikers Island jail complex for a technical parole violation, joining hundreds of other people held in the aging and dysfunctional facility for rules infractions rather than new crimes.* Tyson died on Sunday in a hospital, where he was being treated for COVID-19—the first person to die from the pandemic while in New York City custody, as the extraordinary coronavirus meets the ordinary conditions of incarceration.

Tyson was taken to the hospital on March 26. The next day, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said 400 people held in city jails on technical parole violations would be released, but the names of eligible people are being announced in batches, and Tyson’s attorneys received no word about whether he would be included. As of Tuesday morning, 693 people had their warrants canceled, including 238 people in New York City.

On April 3, Tyson joined a lawsuit filed by the Legal Aid Society of New York, demanding release due to a medical condition that made him particularly vulnerable to adverse complications from the coronavirus.

Two days later, he became the second incarcerated person in the state confirmed to have died from the coronavirus, following 58-year-old Juan Mosquero, who died on March 30 in Sing Sing Correctional Facility.

With the pace of the outbreaks exceeding the pace of the system’s response, more deaths seem certain to follow. America’s prison population is aging and, due to a historical failure of policy, Black people are not only more likely to be incarcerated—they are apparently more likely to succumb to the current coronavirus, a trend emerging from the available demographic data on COVID-19 deaths.

On April 6, Legal Aid urged the state to respond more quickly to the crisis, sending Cuomo a letter listing 105 incarcerated people who would be especially medically vulnerable to complications or death if they were to contract COVID-19.

The letter, a redacted version of which Legal Aid shared with Slate, describes how the listed people fit a set of three criteria that the public defender service believes should each qualify someone for immediate release: They are suffering from serious medical conditions, they’re over the age of 50, or they have an upcoming release date. Legal Aid is also asking the state to conduct a broader review to identify others housed in state jails and prisons who meet similar criteria.

“Due to the prison environment, there’s really no way that the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision can sufficiently protect people from contracting COVID-19,” said Stefen Short, an attorney with Legal Aid’s Prisoners’ Rights Project.

Legal Aid’s letter identifies 39 of the 105 listed as being “acutely vulnerable to infection” and shares their stories, which it hopes will highlight the urgency of decarceration. The descriptions highlight how people suffering from a number of medical issues that could provoke an adverse outcome should they contract COVID-19—including HIV/AIDS, lupus, asthma, hypertension, kidney disease, and epilepsy—are not able to receive adequate access to medical attention or the space to follow federal social distancing guidelines.

Among the people on the list are a 72-year-old man who has served 11 years of a 12-year sentence and who has prostate cancer, Alzheimer’s, rheumatoid arthritis, and “a long (fifteen year) history of respiratory conditions like [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], severe asthma, recurring walking pneumonia and bronchitis.” The letter says he shares a dormitory with 51 other people, which is “close to two other units that are currently used to quarantine individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspected to have it,” and which uses the same common space as those units at different times of day.

A 56-year-old incarcerated woman with lupus, heart disease, and severe asthma is assigned to work in the Department of Motor Vehicles, “where she works with several other people and where the lunch area is small, resulting in her inability to maintain the recommended six feet of distance from others,” according to the letter. In prison, she shares “a day room, toilets, sinks and shower areas” with other women, “and cleaning supplies are not readily available.”

Their stories highlight a stark inconsistency between the social distancing measures Cuomo has advocated for and the rate at which he’s been willing to decarcerate New York jails and prisons.

“We hear him make statements all day long about how New Yorkers should stay home and avoid social gatherings—and he’s raising fines for failing to comply—but it is completely within his power to help DOCCS try to achieve some of the same measures of protection in our state prisons and he’s just not taking that action,” said Elizabeth Isaacs, an attorney with Legal Aid’s Criminal Appeals Bureau.*

Legal Aid has sent four letters to Cuomo and DOCCS but has only received a response to the first one, said Short. The public defender service sent a note on March 18 asking about specific plans to address COVID-19 in state jails and prisons. A follow-up was sent on March 30 demanding the release of four people. Legal Aid claims the state did not respond to either of those letters.

When asked for comment, Cuomo’s office pointed Slate to March 27 comments the governor made regarding the release of prisoners during the pandemic. “We passed one of the most sweeping bill reform bills in the history of the State of New York so we’re incarcerating fewer people than ever before and taking special measures for this virus situation,” Cuomo said during an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. “For example, we’re releasing people who are in jails because they violated parole for non-serious reasons. And wherever we can get people out of jails, out of prisons, now we are. We also put in additional protections in the prisons to try to protect both the workers and the prisoners.”

The office also said that DOCCS has implemented CDC and State Department of Health guidelines.

The full letter can be read below. Legal Aid has redacted the names and corrections ID numbers for those listed because they are sharing private health information and because some clients have expressed concern about retaliation from corrections staff.","Legal Aid is also asking the state to conduct a broader review to identify others housed in state jails and prisons who meet similar criteria.

AUCKLAND, New Zealand—The lockdown currently underway here in New Zealand is a little stricter than much of what’s being enforced in the States at the moment, with the intent of limiting community transmission of coronavirus and flattening the curve of infection here. No going outside unless for food, medicine, or light exercise in your neighborhood. No leaving your bubble. No nonessential driving. Certainly no swimming. No mountain bike track rides, Health Minister David Clark! No 20-kilometer trips to the beach, newly demoted Health Minister David Clark!

It’s a dark time, with the days blurring together and the hours crawling by. New Zealanders may be known for our laid-back, generally cheerful demeanors, but truth be told we’re getting pretty ratty, pretty fast. What’s keeping us going? The daily briefings of New Zealand’s current obsession, an unlikely heartthrob, a mild-mannered health care hero: the national director-general of health, Dr. Ashley Bloomfield.

Ashley Bloomfield is the Kiwi equivalent of the United States’ Anthony Fauci, but with more power to actually make the rules and less outright antipathy toward his country’s leader. Every afternoon, Ashley Bloomfield fronts for the TV cameras (or more accurately, for Facebook Live), either alone or with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at his side, and in his gentle, measured way delivers whatever news he needs to, good or bad.

Waiting for the day that Ashley Bloomfield does a fake-out exit from the podium then walks back for an encore after the gallery journos start chanting Ashley... Ashley... Ashley...



""Three more questions."" — Jamie Morton (@Jamienzherald) April 6, 2020

These briefings always start out the same: a tally of how many more cases and probable cases of COVID-19 there are in the country today, and how many former cases have recovered. Following a quick update on how things are going and any key developments, the floor is open to questions from the media. Nothing Ashley Bloomfield says is particularly remarkable. There have been no mic-drop moments or snappy zingers from the past two weeks’ worth of appearances. He diligently and clearly answers reporters’ questions, and when the number of cases rises, he’s there to reassure us that this is to be expected: This is how the spread of the virus works, but if we all follow the rules, then we should start to see a change in a few weeks. Literally nothing about this messaging is exciting or immediately satisfying, so you may be surprised to learn New Zealanders can’t get enough of watching Ashley Bloomfield deliver it.

Ashley Bloomfield is by all accounts a nice man who is very good at his job. Given that his job right now is to stop us all from dying in a pandemic, he’s become something of a national sensation. Google trends show NZ searches for his name spiking exponentially. A Twitter stan account has been set up, journalists tweet when they find out when his next appearance is scheduled, and his name has become synonymous with doing the right thing. Writer Anna Rawhiti-Connell wrote of our collective infatuation with the man she insists must only ever be referred to by his full name in an essay for the local website Newsroom: “On Sunday, Ashley Bloomfield returned to his rightful place as host of the Ashley Bloomfield Power Hour. On being asked about how many people with Covid-19 were Māori or Pasifika, Ashley Bloomfield gave the exact percentages to one decimal place.”

Today is the day: Ashley Bloomfield is taking a day off 👏 — Veronica Schmidt (@veronicaschm1dt) March 27, 2020

My country expresses its passion for Ashley Bloomfield in a lot of different ways. We’re concerned about him: An article about him finally having a day off was syndicated to three local news sites (in a country with about six major online news platforms total). We’re horny for him: I’ve seen no shortage of tweets like this, and “ashley bloomfield wife” remains one of the top auto-fill responses on Google.

But mostly, we just want to be taken care of by him. Ashley Bloomfield is, at this moment, his nation’s collective dad. Dad is calm and reassuring always, even when his children (the press gallery) ask once again why they can’t go kayaking even though he just explained why. Dad doesn’t lose his temper, even though he is very tired. Dad wants us all to follow the rules, not because he gets off on the power of making them, but because he wants the best for us. This pandemic is fundamentally changing the entire way our world system functions, and it’s nice to feel like there’s an adult in the room who knows what to do next.

It’s something I wish for the U.S., as I watch Donald Trump flailing about from one disastrous press conference to the next, with none of the people able to stop him seemingly willing to, and none of the people (like Fauci) who are willing to step in possessing the structural power to do so. It’s dire, and terrifying. In comparison to that daily car crash, Ashley Bloomfield’s boring civil servant competence is exactly the balm we need right now.

Lockdown is forcing us into a period of cultural modesty: no hitting up bars, no hookups, no parties. We’re all taking daily healthsome walks, or baking our own bread, or taking up knitting, or seriously thinking about finally reading Middlemarch. That a calm, kind, blandly handsome health official should be one hero of this era seems only fitting. May your country find its Ashley Bloomfield, too.

12,COVID-19 Should Make Us Rethink Our Destructive Relationship With the Natural World,Jane Goodall,"Getty Images Plus.

Slate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.

Of all the things I learned during my years in the rainforest of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania conducting my research into the behavior of chimpanzees, one of the most important is how all life is interconnected. Every species has a role to play in the complex web of life. As an example, deforestation in the Congo Basin, the Amazon, and the tropical forests of Asia may seem unimportant to people in the United States or Europe, yet the loss of these forests (as well as other ecosystems) is altering global weather patterns and affecting people in all parts of the world. We humans are part of the natural world—we relate to each other and with all the other animals who inhabit the planet with us. Similarly, in many parts of the world, people may not know—or care—about the little animal called a pangolin (or scaly anteater). But that changes once they know the role that pangolins probably played in the emergence of the current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.

Close proximity to wild animals, especially in “wet markets” that sell live animals, can give rise to diseases caused by viruses that cross the species barrier and jump into us. The SARS outbreak originated in a meat market in China from a civet (a small mammal), MERS from a camel in the Middle East. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 may have originated in bats, transferred to pangolins, and then infected humans at a live animal market in China. Of the many new diseases that have emerged since 1960, scientists estimate that more than half were caused by transmission from other species to humans. You’d think by now we would have learned how easily it could happen again.

The global demand for wildlife, the destruction of the natural world, and the spread of diseases are already having a catastrophic effect on the world as we know it. We are in the midst of the Sixth Great Extinction, the balance of nature has been disturbed, and the suffering of humans and other animals has increased. It’s hard to really grasp the extent of the damage. Just as it is true that we tend to think about the suffering of humans as collections of people—refugees, child laborers, the homeless—rather than the suffering of the individuals comprising those groups, so too do people seldom think about the suffering of individuals when we talk of threatened wildlife species. But each individual animal of a species, like each human, is important.

The global demand for wildlife, the destruction of the natural world, and the spread of diseases are already having a catastrophic effect on the world as we know it.

We are currently in a somewhat unprecedented moment of realizing just how vulnerable each one of us is to problems that may start far away from us, in other species, in other parts of the world. COVID-19 is many things, but it is also a reason to reckon with the enormous impact that something damaging the natural world can have on us as individuals.

We are now feeling the true cost of wildlife trafficking and the destruction of the natural world that brings us into closer contact with wildlife. My own work has shown me how thousands of great apes are stolen from the wild every year. They are hunted for bush meat and for their body parts, and infants are captured alive to be sold overseas illegally as pets, or for zoos, entertainment, and tourist attractions. This market is distressing for any lover of these wonderful creatures, but it also threatens their very existence. Many other species are in danger too, including elephants, rhinos, the big cats, giraffes, reptiles, and more. Pangolins are the most trafficked animals on Earth. As we mourn the affect this trade has on the individuals that suffer it, we must also see that this global demand and tragedy created the circumstances that have likely resulted in the current pandemic. The risk it poses to humans is certainly another reason to stand up against this behavior.

Thankfully, a strict ban of wildlife trafficking was implemented in China soon after the emergence of COVID-19, including forbidding the importation, selling, and eating of wild animals. And other countries, like Vietnam, are following suit. Currently these measures do not ban trade for fur, medicine, or research, but I am hopeful that these loopholes will be closed. This is a global trade, and every country and individual must do its part to create more comprehensive legislation to protect wildlife, end illegal trafficking, ban trafficking across national borders, and ban sales (especially online). And we must fight corruption that allows these activities to continue even when they are banned or illegal. In addition, chimpanzees and other great apes, with whom we share so much of our biology, are also susceptible to transmission of disease from humans and have suffered terribly from respiratory illnesses, including coronaviruses, passed on from humans. We must be much more vigilant about not handling or being in close proximity to wildlife to protect ourselves and them.

Still, even as we fight for a world without the trafficking and eating of wildlife, we must also remember that there are many people who depend on this trade for income. These efforts will be in vain if we don’t support alternative forms of work. Our global chapters of the Jane Goodall Institute use Tacare, our method of community-based conservation that focuses on listening to the needs of people. We support the development of environmentally sustainable livelihoods, such as agroforestry, beekeeping, and local handicrafts, for instance. We give people the tools to create village land use management plans that include protection of community forests and creation of wildlife corridors. And we support their ability to monitor the health of their environment with cutting-edge technology. Through this process, they recognize that protection of the environment safeguards their own futures, the future of their children, and the future of wildlife. This model for local empowerment is already operating in six countries where JGI works, and I hope it can be used in many more places around the world.

Solutions to the threats discussed above are within our grasp. The laws we create now to protect wildlife will also protect human communities. Restoring and protecting forests through legislation and empowering local communities will save species and prevent disease transmission. Creating alternative sustainable livelihoods will create more resilient, successful human communities. It is desperately important, in the window of time remaining, that we should all do our bit to heal the harm we have inflicted on the natural world—of which we are a part. Let us stop stealing the future from our children and from the other species with whom we share our home.","The global demand for wildlife, the destruction of the natural world, and the spread of diseases are already having a catastrophic effect on the world as we know it.

13,WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend. Without Fans. It Was Weird.,David Bixenspan,"The ring was populated; the stands were not. Getty Images Plus

This year’s WrestleMania ended up quite different from what anyone expected.

Once the novel coronavirus pandemic hit, WWE moved almost all of its scheduled events—everything from the regular weekly TV shows to the biggest card of the year—to its WWE Performance Center gym in suburban Orlando, Florida, the exception being some tapings for the promotion’s television program NXT, which filmed at nearby Full Sail University. All these were staged in front of exactly zero fans, eerie reminders of the outside world that made it hard to watch the shows as escapist entertainment, especially since the first few broadcasts were set up the same way they would have been if they were open to the public, complete with empty chairs. The presentation improved in recent weeks, with the chairs removed and the main camera adjusted to face the entrance ramp, but the overall vibe hasn’t changed much. WWE’s overproduced, micromanaged house style was generally not translating to an empty room. A number of the wrestlers, like Velveteen Dream, have spent the bulk of their careers learning that style and, in the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, looked significantly more like they were doing bad playacting and play-fighting than they usually do. Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn’t actually there.

At the same time, WWE rival All Elite Wrestling did a much better job adjusting to wrestling during the pandemic, as questionable as such an endeavor may be. AEW first taped its shows at circuit owners Shahid and Tony Khan’s Daily’s Place outdoor amphitheater, in Jacksonville, Florida, but then moved to a carefully dressed wrestling school near Atlanta. Wrestlers were placed ringside to react to the show and provide atmosphere, though this first show’s “audience” flagrantly violated social distancing practices. (They’ve been adjusting to find a happy medium since then.) Some smaller, independent wrestling operations also ran empty arena shows of mixed quality before state governments started to shut down everything. But the upshot from a few weeks of the events was that while WWE’s style of pro wrestling didn’t translate to a show without an audience, showcasing athletic and hard-hitting fights worked, and so did having the wrestlers add noise by trash talking, as long as they didn’t overdo it. But the WWE style—with its emphasis on overwrought capital-P “performance,” over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms—looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.

Against the odds, a healthy and surprising percentage of the show leaned into what’s succeeded in both promotions recently, and managed to be pretty entertaining.

But at first, it didn’t look good on Saturday night, when the broadcast opened with a match for the Women’s Tag Team Championship that probably would have been great in a stadium setting. The match was dynamic and fast-paced, but it felt like a regular really good match dropped into an empty room without enough adjustments. Worse, the match was drastically overproduced, ramping up the frantic style WWE fans are accustomed to. The typical quick cuts and camera movement translated as significantly more intrusive than usual. The in-ring effort was so strong that it managed to make me feel bad for those involved. A throwaway grudge match—in which Elias, a guitar-playing drifter, defeated abrasive villain King Corbin—had a lot of the same problems as the opener, without the good parts. Together, the first two contests gave an impression that this was going to be a show full of low-impact wrestlers doing Performance Center performances.

Strictly as a piece of business, the John Cena psycho quest was fabulous.

That changed with match three, where Becky Lynch successfully defended her Raw Women’s Championship against former top MMA fighter Shayna Baszler, a longtime training partner of Ronda Rousey’s. Finally, the wrestlers started to unlock one of the keys to making wrestling work in a small room without fans: laying in their strikes so they look better and make audible noise. If you’re not a big wrestling fan, this may sound a bit weird, or even antithetical to the point of pro wrestling, but it’s not. Making things look good while barely touching your opponent is the ideal, but that wasn’t going to look good in this environment much of the time, as the lack of a crowd requires closer camera angles and fewer wide shots. So making things look good without hurting your opponent becomes the goal. Wrestlers have plenty of tricks that allow them to hit each other hard in low-risk parts of the body, and in a WWE where the women’s matches are often more intense and violent than the men’s matches, Lynch and Baszler tagging each other repeatedly with thudding strikes that ricocheted off the walls of the converted warehouse was exactly what the show needed. Sami Zayn defending his Intercontinental Championship against Daniel Bryan in the next match was more of the same, just with more loud trash talk, and that also translated well.

Just about everything else for the rest of Night One featured wrestlers who seemed blissfully unafraid of hitting each other. (Even though it does introduce additional body-on-body contact during the pandemic—not that there wasn’t already plenty, as the wrestlers grappled with each other. WWE is claiming to have taken every possible precaution, but that’s far from foolproof without testing.) Of particular note was a ladder match that saw a lot of the usual stunts—without the adrenaline rush of thousands of screaming fans to help the wrestlers push through the pain. That had to suck, but it was also balanced out by Jimmy Uso taking a big fall to the floor where viewers didn’t see his landing. If they used a crash pad here, more power to them. Kevin Owens diving off the WrestleMania sign onto Seth Rollins in the next match was similarly spectacular, and Braun Strowman’s Universal Championship victory over Goldberg was exactly what it should have been: a short, explosive battle of living superheroes.

The very physical matches made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, Night One was really strong overall. But not every match was in that setting.

Two matches were announced for the weekend’s cards that were clearly going to be on some kind of alternate set instead of being at the Performance Center: the Undertaker vs. A.J. Styles in a “Boneyard Match,” which closed Night One, and John Cena vs. “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt in a “Firefly Fun House Match,” which would air on Night Two. All that anyone really knew was that they would be matches shot on sets elsewhere and that it seemed, from comments that Triple H gave to TV Guide, like they went well enough that we’ll be seeing more.

And they really did work.

The Boneyard Match was a cross between a main event–style WWE match and a gloriously trashy action movie from the ’90s. The wrestlers had a pretty intense brawl, the “acting” parts worked great, and because it involved the Undertaker, the weirdest parts made just enough sense to not seem out of place. The fight also completely opens up what the Undertaker—broken down from decades of taking bumps on a huge frame—can do in a big match. For the past six years, he’s been hit or miss (mostly miss), but doing something that’s part match and part movie allows a lot more opportunities to hide the weaknesses that his physical condition introduces. Purists may hate it, but it still stayed within the boundaries of what’s long been expected of the Undertaker character, a MAGA dad biker who can turn on his undead-wizard-king powers at the drop of a hat. Stay within those walls, nail the production, and trust the wrestlers enough to perform well without overwriting them, and you could get something like this. Popularizing a type of “cinematic” match where camera tricks, editing, special effects, and stunt doubles are basic tools means that a very debilitated Mark Calaway may have just tacked many more years onto his career as the Undertaker.

The expectations were high for the Cena-Wyatt “match” that followed as a result, and at least from a production perspective, it met or exceeded those expectations. The conceit that Wyatt was using magic or drugs (or something?) to take Cena on a journey through his past and his psyche was a bridge too far for some fans, even though many of those same fans can tolerate an inherently over-the-top and supernatural character like the Undertaker. (In fairness, Undertaker-Styles was not supposed to be taking place inside either wrestler’s head.) But strictly as a piece of business, the Cena psycho quest was fabulous. Using puppets, costume choices, set decorations, and licensed music (an element of the Boneyard Match as well), the wrestlers and the production team put on something that was part Twin Peaks’ Red Room, part B-movie, part alt-comedy, and a whole bunch of nostalgia. The match included heaps of fan service, like the wrestlers being transported into Saturday Night’s Main Event, WWE’s old show on NBC, as well as transporting Cena into classic moments such as his WWE debut and his first big match with Wyatt. Describing it any further in a way that would make sense to lapsed fans or nonfans would take forever, so just trust me when I say that it worked on the merits of what it aspired to accomplish.

Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said for most of the rest of Night Two. The opener, with Charlotte Flair winning the title NXT Championship from Rhea Ripley, was another very physical match, albeit the talkiest to that point. Aleister Black vs. Bobby Lashley was hard-hitting, and Otis vs. Dolph Ziggler was a lovely climax to the unlikely romance storyline between Otis and Mandy Rose. (Nevertheless, it would have worked better in front of humans.) Then the big grudge match, between Edge and Randy Orton, took place, and it went 37 minutes while taking them all over the building. It was glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match. They could only throw forearms to the back convincingly, and the attempts at drama were unbearably overwrought. I felt badly for Edge, who was making his big comeback in his first singles match since being forced into retirement eight years ago, but the lack of a crowd was not the biggest problem here.

Meanwhile, in the match for the other men’s world title (don’t ask), Drew McIntyre defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title—in a carbon copy of the Strowman-Goldberg match, complete with how many times each guy hit his big signature move in a few minutes. It was a nice moment for Drew, who let all of the emotions of being officially positioned as the top guy take over his face. But it otherwise felt a lot more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.

From a pure spectator point of view, staging fanless shows as if nothing in the world has changed, or like the broadcast could be a carbon copy of the sport in the Before Times, ought to be a major takeaway from WrestleMania 36 for broadcasters, and not just the WWE’s. If you’re a hardcore combat sports fan, you’ve probably seen plenty of preliminary fights on a boxing or MMA card happen in front of near-empty arenas, so it wasn’t a huge stretch to switch to vacant seats at the big event. Various legitimate combat sports promotions, including the UFC, ran some empty arena events at first too, with varying success, but with screaming coaches ringside or cageside, it was not nearly as distracting as empty-arena pro wrestling. And sports that feature longer stretches of quiet, like golf and, to an extent, even baseball, could probably translate better without fans (though they wouldn’t be perfect) than those like basketball and football, where the immediacy and energy of the crowd feels more integral and inherent to the TV experience.

All those sports could very well first return to television from coronavirus quarantine without live audiences, to broadcast for the rest of us still stuck at home, and they could learn something from the pageant of WrestleMania. Tighter focus on the performers, their dynamic athleticism, and the drama within each specific matchup worked well in this setting. So did fun experimentation that took advantage of the new scope of the show and turned its limits into strengths. Relying on most of the old tricks and camera moves worked much less well. In team sports, what would replace the booming Jumbotron calls to action, the mascot running through the stands, the shots of jubilant and devastated opposing fans after a big score? Something will have to take their place, and maybe soon: MLB is threatening to come back in May, UFC is supposedly securing private islands to hold bouts, and the NFL is proceeding as if it has immunity. The leagues would do well to start considering how the likely post-pandemic format could shape what audiences see and what they want from the show—as it did in WrestleMania 36.

For its part, pro wrestling is always going to suffer without live fans, because it is, at its heart, a performance art exhibition of an entertainment sport where the performers have, historically, been at their best when they were improvising and feeding off the energy of the crowd to figure out where to go next.

Where WWE goes from here, then, is anyone’s guess, as it’s most likely about to run out of taped shows—so it’s not as if there are going to be any immediate repercussions from the largely positive reception for the cinematic Styles-Undertaker and Cena-Wyatt matches. But in a company owned and operated by a billionaire who’s long had a psychological complex about where he made his money, a man who loves to say that what WWE does is “making movies” in spite of never quite pulling it off, it’s clear that we’re going to be seeing some weird shit shot on location for years to come. WWE has a habit of overdoing it, and that could very well happen, but thanks to the natural gap in any action we’re about to get, the biggest name in professional wrestling is probably going to be saved from its worst instincts for a while.

27,"Live updates: WHO chief pushes back at Trump, says politicizing coronavirus could lead to ‘many more body bags’",Siobhán O'Grady,"The Chinese city of Wuhan emerged Wednesday from its 76-day lockdown, with 11 million residents able to move around the city and the country — provided their government-issued “health code” shines green.

Wuhan staged a grand light show under the theme “Heroic City, Heroic People” to celebrate the reopening of the central Chinese metropolis where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year. But the trauma and isolation of the past two months have taken a huge toll: More than 2,500 Wuhan residents died of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and tens of thousands were hospitalized, according to official figures. Now, people must piece their lives and livelihoods back together.

“Even though the epidemic might be ending, for some groups of people the trauma might be just starting,” Du Mingjun, who set up a 24-hour mental health hotline, told a Reuters reporter in Wuhan.

Authorities had been cautious about allowing Wuhan to come out of its quarantine, gradually allowing parts of the city to return to a semblance of normal over the past week or so. The final barrier came down at midnight on Wednesday, when people were allowed to leave Wuhan for the first time since Jan. 23. Cars and trucks were lined up for hours at the city’s 76 tollgates. A Phoenix TV reporter posted a video of vehicles streaming out.

“I’m very excited,” Li Qing, a Wuhan native waiting at a toll gate so she could return to her work in Jiangsu province, told the Sixth Tone website. “The city can’t stay sealed off forever — we need to go to work.”

More than 55,000 people were estimated to be leaving Wuhan by train on Wednesday, with 40 percent going to the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong. The first flight to leave Wuhan’s Tianhe International Airport since the city lifted the lockdown was a China Eastern plane bound for Sanya, on the resort island of Hainan.

Most of those leaving appeared to be migrant workers trying to return to jobs elsewhere in China. The lockdown began on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday, often the only time of year that people can visit their hometowns and families.

But the Communist Party secretary for Hubei province, Ying Yong, said that Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, was not out of the woods. “Zero new infection doesn’t mean zero risk in the epidemic,” Ying said Tuesday. “The lifting of the traffic lockdown doesn’t mean a lifting of epidemic control measures; the reopening of the city gate doesn’t mean that we should open the doors to our homes.”","Wuhan staged a grand light show under the theme “Heroic City, Heroic People” to celebrate the reopening of the central Chinese metropolis where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year.

More than 70,000 people have died worldwide in the covid-19 pandemic as of April 6, and the number of reported cases is over 1 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The United States is now the outbreak’s epicenter, with more reported infections than any other country.

Several countries are confirming thousands of new cases of covid-19 each day, led by the United States, where testing was slow to begin.

On March 31, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the pandemic “the most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.”

[Tracking the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, state by state]

The disease, which can trigger severe respiratory symptoms, has been reported on every continent except Antarctica and in at least 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.

The U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories. As more tests are performed, many states are seeing rapid growth in the number of known cases.

In the early months, China, where the outbreak originated last year, reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data. The country is reporting an uptick in new cases as travelers return from abroad.

As the disease waned in China, it began to surge through Europe, and by late March, more people had died from the virus in Italy and Spain than in China.

Chinese officials said the new virus strain emerged in the Hubei province’s capital city of Wuhan.

Confirmed cases

Coronaviruses range from some common cold viruses to those that cause much more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some strains spread more efficiently than others; the virus that causes covid-19 seems to spread easily from person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

What began with a handful of mysterious illnesses in a central China city has traveled the world. First detected on the last day of 2019, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 70,000 people with infections surpassing a million worldwide. It has triggered nationwide lockdowns, stock market upheaval and dangerous conspiracy theories.

Most cases are mild, but health officials say much is still unknown about the virus that causes the disease now named covid-19.

The Washington Post has spoken to scores of doctors, officials and experts to answer as many of your questions as we can about the newest global health emergency. Here’s what we know so far.

What is it?

These days, “coronavirus” is often prefaced with the word “novel,” because that’s precisely what it is: a new strain in a family of viruses we’ve all seen before — and, in some form, had. According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to much more serious diseases. These diseases can infect both humans and animals. The strain that began spreading in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

Symptoms of a coronavirus infection range in severity from respiratory problems to cases of pneumonia, kidney failure and a buildup of fluid in the lungs.

Covid-19 spreads more easily than SARS and is similar to other coronaviruses that cause cold-like symptoms, experts have said. It appears to be highly transmissible, and since cases are mild, the disease may be more widespread than current testing numbers suggest.

What is concerning, however, is that symptoms can be mild, and the disease can clearly spread before people realize they’re sick.

Similar to other respiratory illnesses, older people and those with illnesses such as diabetes and high blood pressure are at increased risk. Data show that the virus is killing more men than women in the U.S.

But, as with other diseases, there can be tremendous individual variation in how people respond. There will be people with known risk factors who recover as well as people who develop severe cases for reasons we don’t understand.

There’s also no evidence that children are more prone to contracting covid-19, according to the CDC, and that was also the case with the disease′s cousins, SARS and MERS.

How should I prepare?

There are some basic precautions you can take, which are the same as what you should be doing every day to stave off other respiratory diseases. You’ve seen the guidance before: Wash your hands regularly. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze. And when you’re sick, stay home from work or school and drink lots of fluids.

The CDC recommends washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose or sneezing. It also advises not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth and to clean objects and surfaces you touch often.

Coronavirus is officially a pandemic. What does that mean?

The World Health Organization has declared coronavirus a pandemic.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the scale of the outbreak and said he elected to use the word because some countries have not reacted quickly enough.

Disease experts use the term “pandemic” to describe when an epidemic has become rampant in multiple countries and continents simultaneously. (The term comes from the Greek word “pan,” meaning “all,” and “demos,” meaning “people.”)

While the word may evoke fear, it describes how widespread an outbreak may be, not its deadliness.

In the past, health experts have used “pandemic” as a signal that efforts to contain an outbreak have failed and that countries should focus their efforts more on mitigating its effects through actions such as getting hospitals ready to handle an influx of patients, stockpiling materials and enacting social-distancing policies.

What’s it like to have covid-19?

Symptoms are primarily respiratory. Coughing and shortness of breath are common, according to the CDC. Fever is also possible. The severity of the symptoms depends highly on the patient’s age and immune system.

For the elderly and those with underlying heart disease, diabetes or other conditions, coronavirus can cause pneumonia and lead to organ failure and death. But for most people, cases have been mild, requiring little to no medical intervention.

Should I see a doctor?

It is a good idea to call your primary-care doctor if you have both a fever and a cough, experts said. And if you have shortness of breath, unremitting fever, weakness or lethargy, it’s definitely time to get in touch with a health-care professional, they say. Those could be signs of pneumonia, which is common in severe cases of coronavirus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends that you seek medical help if you recently traveled to a coronavirus-infected area or had close contact with a known infected person and have a fever, a cough or trouble breathing.

Read more about seeking medical help and getting tested here.

How can I get tested?

If you have mild symptoms, you probably won’t be. If you are sick enough to be hospitalized, you’ll likely get tested. If you are in the middle group, it’s unclear.

And even as more tests are being manufactured and shipped around the country, many public health labs receiving them don’t have enough staff or equipment to meet the testing need. Some medical centers are offering their own tests, and some primary care doctors are exploring how to administer the tests in their offices, but many are reluctant because it carries risks for their staff and other patients.

Other hospitals and localities are setting up testing locations away from emergency rooms, clinics and doctors’ offices to minimize the risk of health care workers and other patients being infected. And, in declaring a national emergency, Trump said the administration will work with retailers like Walmart and Target to develop drive-through testing clinics across the country.

How long will I have to social distance?

The most honest answer, according to experts, is: “It depends.” It’s not going to be over anytime soon — a matter of months rather than weeks. And a few key factors will determine just how many months.

First, it depends on when U.S. cases finally reach their peak — a time that’s impossible to predict because of how limited testing remains in America. And even after the peak, we may need drastic actions to keep the virus at bay. It also depends on how the virus behaves, and whether it’ll be affected by the change of seasons like the flu.

But, ultimately, how well America is able to flatten and bend its epidemiological curve of infections depends largely on how willing people will be to sacrifice individual conveniences and on their desire to save the lives of others.

“I don’t know if people are ready now for how long they’re probably going to have to keep up this social distancing,"" said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. ""But as they see the hospital situation get more extreme, I think that attitude will change.”

Should I wear a mask?

President Trump announced new guidance in April that people in the U.S. wear face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus, a reversal of the administration’s earlier recommendations.

The guidance makes clear that wearing face coverings or cloth masks is an additional public health measure to prevent the spread of the virus, not a substitute for social distancing. Social distancing of at least six feet is still recommended even when wearing a mask. Guidance and internal memos from CDC emphasize that a cloth facial mask is intended not so much to protect the wearer but to help prevent people who do not know they are infected from spreading of the virus to others.

The new CDC guidance was prompted by increasing evidence that infected people without symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Simple cloth masks that cover the mouth and nose can prevent virus transmission from such individuals when they are out buying groceries, where people may come into closer contact, for example.

When will it end?

This coronavirus could follow a seasonal pattern, peaking in the winter months. It could infect lots of people now and then recede in the Northern Hemisphere before returning in the fall.

“This virus can do anything it wants,” said Allison McGeer, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. “That pattern of how it’s going to spread is completely unknown, but it is critical to what the burden is going to be to all of us. … It could be just like another coronavirus, a bunch of colds. It could be like a regular flu season. It’s possible it could be different and worse.”

More questions, answered

Terms to know

Coronavirus: This term refers to a family of seven known viruses that can infect people, ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the even deadlier Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The name comes from the virus’s shape, which under a microscope looks like a blob surrounded by crown-like spikes.

Covid-19: Sometimes used interchangeably with coronavirus and the official name SARS-CoV-2, covid-19 refers to the disease the virus causes. So SARS-CoV-2 causes covid-19, just as HIV causes AIDS.

Community transmission: This happens when a disease circulates among people in a certain area who did not travel to an affected location and have no close link to other confirmed cases.

Asymptomatic transmission: Asymptomatic carriers of the virus are people who show no signs of being sick but have the virus and can spread it to others.

Outbreak: A sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease in a particular place and time.

Epidemic: A large outbreak that spreads among a population or in a region.

Pandemic: An epidemic that has become rampant in multiple countries and continents simultaneously.

“Flattening the curve”: A phrase that experts use when talking about the need to use protective measures to slow the spread of new cases. It refers to the powerful visual illustration seen on a statistical chart. A flattened curve is the difference between a viral outbreak that has the profile of Mount Everest, exploding vertically, and one that slowly unfolds over time — a long, low hill.

Containment: In the early phases of an epidemic, countries often use this strategy of trying to corral and beat back the advance of a virus in hopes of limiting its spread and possibly stamping it out. They restrict movement of people, enact travel bans and quarantine. To use a military analogy, it is treating new cases like a beachhead invasion and surrounding and beating back each new beachhead.

Mitigation: Once it’s clear you’re dealing with widespread transmission that will be difficult if not impossible to contain, authorities begin focusing instead on wider preparations like getting hospitals ready to handle influx of patients, stockpiling materials and enacting social distancing policies.

Isolation: Keeping those who are sick and infected away from those who aren’t is referred to as isolation. Hospitals have taken strict measures to isolate coronavirus patients using isolation wards, ventilators that prevent air from circulating more widely and heavy protective gear for health workers.

Quarantine: Restricting the movement of people who seem healthy but may have been exposed to the virus is known as a quarantine. Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan and cruise ships, for example, have been kept in strict quarantine on military bases for 14 days, which is what experts believe is the virus’s incubation period.

Zoonotic: The new coronavirus was transmitted from animals to people, making it zoonotic. SARS came from civets, which are like cats, and MERS came from camels, but it’s not yet known what animal caused the current coronavirus outbreak. The prime suspect so far is the pangolin.

What is it?

These days, “coronavirus” is often prefaced with the word “novel,” because that’s precisely what it is: a new strain in a family of viruses we’ve all seen before — and, in some form, had. According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to much more serious diseases. These diseases can infect both humans and animals. The strain that began spreading in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

Symptoms of a coronavirus infection range in severity from respiratory problems to cases of pneumonia, kidney failure and a buildup of fluid in the lungs.

Covid-19 spreads more easily than SARS and is similar to other coronaviruses that cause cold-like symptoms, experts have said. It appears to be highly transmissible, and since cases are mild, the disease may be more widespread than current testing numbers suggest.

What is concerning, however, is that symptoms can be mild, and the disease can clearly spread before people realize they’re sick.

42,Gen Z was fed up with the status quo. The coronavirus could reinforce their liberal politics.,Hannah Knowles,"“There’s so much anger and frustration that these are things that have been impacting us for so long, and it took a pandemic?” Rehac said. “Here’s all of this attention and, all of a sudden, all of these resources that everyone said didn’t exist.”

Generation Z was already politically liberal, increasingly activist and fed up with the status quo. The oldest members of the generation — which includes those born from 1997 to 2012, according to the Pew Research Center — grew up amid soaring inequality and overwhelmingly backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primaries. Sanders withdrew from the presidential race Wednesday.

Now the coronavirus crisis may solidify their political identity, experts say. As the pandemic and its economic havoc exacerbate disparities, some Gen Zers see grim validation of their support for the government-run programs and social-welfare policies less popular with their parents and grandparents. Seventy percent of them believe the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 53 percent of Gen Xers and 49 percent of baby boomers, according to Pew.

Gen Z cares “really deeply about inequalities and addressing that directly,” said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, who directs the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. “And that’s part of the reason big government appeals to them … universal health care, universal income and all that. And I think this pandemic, if anything, would really kind of affirm their position.""

Images of carefree spring breakers, who traveled to beach towns last month as concerns mounted about the virus’s spread, have dominated popular views of the generation. The nation erupted with fury at Miami Beach revelers who griped about bar shutdowns. They fed the worst stereotypes of young people as self-absorbed and thoughtless about the elderly most likely to die if they didn’t help “flatten the curve” to slow the spread of infection so that the health-care system isn’t overwhelmed.

But for another segment of the generation — which turned the trauma of school shootings and grim forecasts about the climate into millions-strong movements — the virus has energized their political activism. They see this crisis as inextricably linked to other problems that plague them and wonder whether the coronavirus pandemic could bring more people around to their calls for radical change.

As the seriousness of the crisis settled in for 17-year-old Xiye Bastida, she canceled a trip to Mexico and drew up a strict “quarantine schedule” for her weekdays holed up indoors, limiting herself to one hour of Netflix.

AD

AD

Sacrifice is a driving philosophy of Bastida’s politics. The climate activist, whom news outlets have dubbed “America’s Greta Thunberg,” has begged others to make big, uncomfortable changes to avert disaster.

“It’s for the greater good,” she says of the societal shutdown that put her senior year in limbo.

She and other young activists have been using some of their time in self-quarantine to organize protests and grow the movements behind their own causes. They have incorporated the pandemic into their messaging about health care, climate change and income inequality.

Written into Bastida’s Friday schedule: “Strike for Climate and an appropriate government response to COVID-19. ”

“They will see this as a life-changing moment in many ways,” Kawashima-Ginsberg predicted, “whereas older adults may see this as a really major disruption in our lives, hopefully going back. ”

The crisis generation

Bastida doesn’t want the world to go back to normal, even as her life in New York City is upended. Yes, prom was canceled; her parents’ jobs and work visas are newly uncertain; her family has fled their apartment for a friend’s home in Massachusetts, worried about staying in the building where young and old share the same elevator.

AD

AD

But for Bastida, back to normal would mean returning to a society in which individual interest reigns and each generation fends for its own well-being.

“Emotionally, a lot of people are very unsettled … feeling like this is a crisis,” Bastida said of the pandemic. “And this is how we feel every day. ”

In a Pew poll conducted in late March, the majority of adult Gen Zers said the virus is a “major threat” to the country’s economy and the health of the population. While only 22 percent saw it as a threat to their own health, a majority believe the pandemic put their personal financial situation at risk.

Recent data from the center found workers ages 16 to 24 — half of whom work in the hard-hit service sector — will be disproportionately affected by layoffs due to the virus, although most high school and college students won’t get checks from the government’s massive stimulus plan. Researchers are wondering whether the coronavirus pandemic will become to Gen Z what the Great Recession was to millennials.

AD

Millennials “came into adulthood in a really difficult economic time, and they really struggled to get their footing,” said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. “We thought it was going to be different for Gen Z. But now this sort of turns that all upside down.”

Rather than be sidelined by that turmoil, many young activists are finding ways to push their political efforts forward.

Normally, Bastida would march out after AP calculus and set up at city hall for a climate change protest. But in these strange new times, it was a digital strike, with video chats and tweeted pictures of cardboard signs. Social media savvy and already serving as tech support for work-from-home parents, Gen Z was perfectly fine moving online.

Joe Hobbs, a 17-year-old volunteer for Fridays for Future, the youth climate movement that Thunberg founded, said the pandemic has only intensified many young people’s commitments to their causes.

AD

“We’re finding that across the globe, Fridays for Future activists and organizers are doing even more because they have nothing else to do,” Hobbs said from Columbia, Md., where he’s under a stay-at-home order. “They don’t have school to distract them. ”

March for Our Lives, the student-led group that mobilized for gun control after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018, has been tweeting about two public health emergencies: “Denial isn’t a policy: not for #COVID19, and not for the gun violence epidemic.”

AD

“We need our leaders to ACT to save lives,” the group wrote. “We need REAL policy solutions. ”

In Harlem last week, Rehac was talking about rent cancellation at a pro-Sanders town hall held by video. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) has halted evictions for 90 days, but Housing Justice for All, a coalition that Rehac belongs to, is pushing him to completely wipe out those months of rent. Rehac argues it’s necessary as people stare down weeks and maybe months of unemployment.

AD

She thinks the cancel-rent campaign is gaining steam. And maybe, she added, the pain of shutting down New York City could get more people to listen about the bigger ideas: more stringent rent control, more money for affordable housing.

AD

“If we had a #HomesGuarantee millions of people wouldn’t be worried about paying rent tomorrow,” Housing Justice for All tweeted as the April 1 rent due date loomed. “Or on May 1. Or on June 1. Imagine that. ”

Other young devotees of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, also say the virus has underscored vast gaps in wealth and a broken health-care system. Voters age 24 and younger favored Sanders by huge margins in this year’s Democratic primaries, with three-quarters choosing him in California and Michigan exit polling.

While their turnout lags behind their elders, Gen Z will comprise 1 in 10 eligible voters at the time of the November presidential election, according to Pew.

The coronavirus crisis “really does expose all the inequities that people knew existed but maybe couldn’t see as clearly until this point,” said Roxie Richner. Her high school in Michigan has turned to non-graded “enrichment” activities, she said, unsure how to handle the fact that not everyone has laptops and Internet access.

For years, Richner has been a fervent Sanders supporter — holding a campaign kickoff party in her living room, volunteering ahead of the March 10 Michigan primary and feeling crushed when her candidate lost every county. But maybe, she thought, this moment of upheaval could shift politics in the United States for good. The senator from Vermont has been tweeting about the millions of Americans laid off with “nothing in the bank,” the big companies that said they couldn’t afford paid sick leave, and the people who would die because they waited too long to go to the hospital, anxious about the bill.

A day after celebrating her 18th birthday on March 26 with friends over FaceTime — someone tried to light a toothpick because no one had candles — she was feeling stir-crazy and scared, but also wondering if the country might emerge from all this a bit more open to her generation’s demands.

“I think it does give people some insight into what it’s like experiencing a time of crisis,” Richner said, “and that realization that a lot of America lives in crisis mode 24-7, whether there’s a pandemic or not.”

The greater good

Bastida is wondering whether the needle could move on climate change, the issue that she says became personal for her when her Mexican hometown flooded. She spent the last Friday night in March tuning in from her family friends’ kitchen to a “Zoom party,” which was really a planning meeting for the Earth Day demonstration that would now have to take place fully online.

“Every crisis needs to be treated like a crisis,” her fellow activist Thunberg had said on a public Zoom call last month, not long before announcing she was recovering after exhibiting symptoms of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Bastida ran down to-dos with 11 high school and college students calling in from various time zones, some of them wearing pajamas. They wondered who they could get to appear in an Earth Day video. Willow and Jaden Smith? What about Miley Cyrus? TikTok star Charli D’Amelio?

Someone had reached out to about 50 social media influencers and gotten encouraging responses, although one had asked whether the video would be a “paid gig. ”

Bastida and her friends laughed: No.

Back in the city she left, her 22-year-old friend Daphne Frias is fighting the coronavirus and pneumonia, isolated in a hotel room that ambulances wail past a dozen times a day.

Immunocompromised with cerebral palsy, Frias spent so much time in hospitals growing up that she calls herself a “professional patient.” She has gotten pneumonia almost every year for the last seven years. She didn’t wait for a stay-at-home order, retreating indoors before a single case of the coronavirus was confirmed in New York.

But March 9 was a beautiful, warm day, she said, and she allowed herself a trip outside. Four days later, she was coughing and tired, then dizzy and feverish. She tested positive for the coronavirus.

Her mother and sister quarantined with her at home, donning masks and gloves to throw out the garbage. Friends dropped off groceries outside their apartment. But after making a slow recovery, Frias’s fever came roaring back last week, and she decided she needed to separate from her family.

Some of Frias’s health-care costs were covered, she said, but other bills — the hotel room, the medications, the four-times-a-day inhalation treatments that clear her already-weak lungs — are adding up to the point that her bank sends fraud alerts.

Generation Z was already politically liberal, increasingly activist and fed up with the status quo. The oldest members of the generation — which includes those born from 1997 to 2012, according to the Pew Research Center — grew up amid soaring inequality and overwhelmingly backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primaries. Sanders withdrew from the presidential race Wednesday.

Now the coronavirus crisis may solidify their political identity, experts say. As the pandemic and its economic havoc exacerbate disparities, some Gen Zers see grim validation of their support for the government-run programs and social-welfare policies less popular with their parents and grandparents. Seventy percent of them believe the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 53 percent of Gen Xers and 49 percent of baby boomers, according to Pew.

Gen Z cares “really deeply about inequalities and addressing that directly,” said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, who directs the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. “And that’s part of the reason big government appeals to them … universal health care, universal income and all that. And I think this pandemic, if anything, would really kind of affirm their position.""

Images of carefree spring breakers, who traveled to beach towns last month as concerns mounted about the virus’s spread, have dominated popular views of the generation. The nation erupted with fury at Miami Beach revelers who griped about bar shutdowns. They fed the worst stereotypes of young people as self-absorbed and thoughtless about the elderly most likely to die if they didn’t help “flatten the curve” to slow the spread of infection so that the health-care system isn’t overwhelmed.

But for another segment of the generation — which turned the trauma of school shootings and grim forecasts about the climate into millions-strong movements — the virus has energized their political activism. They see this crisis as inextricably linked to other problems that plague them and wonder whether the coronavirus pandemic could bring more people around to their calls for radical change.

As the seriousness of the crisis settled in for 17-year-old Xiye Bastida, she canceled a trip to Mexico and drew up a strict “quarantine schedule” for her weekdays holed up indoors, limiting herself to one hour of Netflix.

Sacrifice is a driving philosophy of Bastida’s politics. The climate activist, whom news outlets have dubbed “America’s Greta Thunberg,” has begged others to make big, uncomfortable changes to avert disaster.

“It’s for the greater good,” she says of the societal shutdown that put her senior year in limbo.

She and other young activists have been using some of their time in self-quarantine to organize protests and grow the movements behind their own causes. They have incorporated the pandemic into their messaging about health care, climate change and income inequality.

Written into Bastida’s Friday schedule: “Strike for Climate and an appropriate government response to COVID-19. ”

“They will see this as a life-changing moment in many ways,” Kawashima-Ginsberg predicted, “whereas older adults may see this as a really major disruption in our lives, hopefully going back. ”

The crisis generation

Bastida doesn’t want the world to go back to normal, even as her life in New York City is upended. Yes, prom was canceled; her parents’ jobs and work visas are newly uncertain; her family has fled their apartment for a friend’s home in Massachusetts, worried about staying in the building where young and old share the same elevator.

But for Bastida, back to normal would mean returning to a society in which individual interest reigns and each generation fends for its own well-being.

“Emotionally, a lot of people are very unsettled … feeling like this is a crisis,” Bastida said of the pandemic. “And this is how we feel every day. ”

In a Pew poll conducted in late March, the majority of adult Gen Zers said the virus is a “major threat” to the country’s economy and the health of the population. While only 22 percent saw it as a threat to their own health, a majority believe the pandemic put their personal financial situation at risk.

Recent data from the center found workers ages 16 to 24 — half of whom work in the hard-hit service sector — will be disproportionately affected by layoffs due to the virus, although most high school and college students won’t get checks from the government’s massive stimulus plan. Researchers are wondering whether the coronavirus pandemic will become to Gen Z what the Great Recession was to millennials.

Millennials “came into adulthood in a really difficult economic time, and they really struggled to get their footing,” said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. “We thought it was going to be different for Gen Z. But now this sort of turns that all upside down.”

Rather than be sidelined by that turmoil, many young activists are finding ways to push their political efforts forward.

Normally, Bastida would march out after AP calculus and set up at city hall for a climate change protest. But in these strange new times, it was a digital strike, with video chats and tweeted pictures of cardboard signs. Social media savvy and already serving as tech support for work-from-home parents, Gen Z was perfectly fine moving online.

Joe Hobbs, a 17-year-old volunteer for Fridays for Future, the youth climate movement that Thunberg founded, said the pandemic has only intensified many young people’s commitments to their causes.

“We’re finding that across the globe, Fridays for Future activists and organizers are doing even more because they have nothing else to do,” Hobbs said from Columbia, Md., where he’s under a stay-at-home order. “They don’t have school to distract them. ”

March for Our Lives, the student-led group that mobilized for gun control after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018, has been tweeting about two public health emergencies: “Denial isn’t a policy: not for #COVID19, and not for the gun violence epidemic.”

“We need our leaders to ACT to save lives,” the group wrote. “We need REAL policy solutions. ”

In Harlem last week, Rehac was talking about rent cancellation at a pro-Sanders town hall held by video. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) has halted evictions for 90 days, but Housing Justice for All, a coalition that Rehac belongs to, is pushing him to completely wipe out those months of rent. Rehac argues it’s necessary as people stare down weeks and maybe months of unemployment.

She thinks the cancel-rent campaign is gaining steam. And maybe, she added, the pain of shutting down New York City could get more people to listen about the bigger ideas: more stringent rent control, more money for affordable housing.

AD

“If we had a #HomesGuarantee millions of people wouldn’t be worried about paying rent tomorrow,” Housing Justice for All tweeted as the April 1 rent due date loomed. “Or on May 1. Or on June 1. Imagine that. ”

Other young devotees of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, also say the virus has underscored vast gaps in wealth and a broken health-care system. Voters age 24 and younger favored Sanders by huge margins in this year’s Democratic primaries, with three-quarters choosing him in California and Michigan exit polling.

While their turnout lags behind their elders, Gen Z will comprise 1 in 10 eligible voters at the time of the November presidential election, according to Pew.

The coronavirus crisis “really does expose all the inequities that people knew existed but maybe couldn’t see as clearly until this point,” said Roxie Richner. Her high school in Michigan has turned to non-graded “enrichment” activities, she said, unsure how to handle the fact that not everyone has laptops and Internet access.

For years, Richner has been a fervent Sanders supporter — holding a campaign kickoff party in her living room, volunteering ahead of the March 10 Michigan primary and feeling crushed when her candidate lost every county. But maybe, she thought, this moment of upheaval could shift politics in the United States for good. The senator from Vermont has been tweeting about the millions of Americans laid off with “nothing in the bank,” the big companies that said they couldn’t afford paid sick leave, and the people who would die because they waited too long to go to the hospital, anxious about the bill.

A day after celebrating her 18th birthday on March 26 with friends over FaceTime — someone tried to light a toothpick because no one had candles — she was feeling stir-crazy and scared, but also wondering if the country might emerge from all this a bit more open to her generation’s demands.

“I think it does give people some insight into what it’s like experiencing a time of crisis,” Richner said, “and that realization that a lot of America lives in crisis mode 24-7, whether there’s a pandemic or not.”

The greater good

Bastida is wondering whether the needle could move on climate change, the issue that she says became personal for her when her Mexican hometown flooded. She spent the last Friday night in March tuning in from her family friends’ kitchen to a “Zoom party,” which was really a planning meeting for the Earth Day demonstration that would now have to take place fully online.

“Every crisis needs to be treated like a crisis,” her fellow activist Thunberg had said on a public Zoom call last month, not long before announcing she was recovering after exhibiting symptoms of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Bastida ran down to-dos with 11 high school and college students calling in from various time zones, some of them wearing pajamas. They wondered who they could get to appear in an Earth Day video. Willow and Jaden Smith? What about Miley Cyrus? TikTok star Charli D’Amelio?

Someone had reached out to about 50 social media influencers and gotten encouraging responses, although one had asked whether the video would be a “paid gig. ”

Bastida and her friends laughed: No.

Back in the city she left, her 22-year-old friend Daphne Frias is fighting the coronavirus and pneumonia, isolated in a hotel room that ambulances wail past a dozen times a day.

Immunocompromised with cerebral palsy, Frias spent so much time in hospitals growing up that she calls herself a “professional patient.” She has gotten pneumonia almost every year for the last seven years. She didn’t wait for a stay-at-home order, retreating indoors before a single case of the coronavirus was confirmed in New York.

But March 9 was a beautiful, warm day, she said, and she allowed herself a trip outside. Four days later, she was coughing and tired, then dizzy and feverish. She tested positive for the coronavirus.

Her mother and sister quarantined with her at home, donning masks and gloves to throw out the garbage. Friends dropped off groceries outside their apartment. But after making a slow recovery, Frias’s fever came roaring back last week, and she decided she needed to separate from her family.

Some of Frias’s health-care costs were covered, she said, but other bills — the hotel room, the medications, the four-times-a-day inhalation treatments that clear her already-weak lungs — are adding up to the point that her bank sends fraud alerts. She needs savings to move to Baltimore in a few months for graduate school, where she’ll work toward a medical degree and master’s in public health. While she found financial relief in a friend’s GoFundMe campaign, she knows others are less fortunate.
