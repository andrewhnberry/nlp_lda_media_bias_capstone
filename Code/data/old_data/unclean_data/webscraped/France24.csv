The African Union’s suspension of Sudan over a paramilitary massacre of civilians this week has been welcomed by the international community. But can the bloc succeed in delivering African solutions to African problems?

Days after the UN Security Council failed to agree on a statement condemning the killing of civilians by Sudanese security forces, the African Union (AU) on Thursday suspended Sudan from the 55-member bloc “until the effective establishment of a civilian-led” transitional authority. In an age when the failure of multilateral organisations dominates the discourse in international policy and human rights circles, the robust response by the AU to the June 3 massacre of more than 100 civilians, according to Sudanese opposition groups, was a welcome change that caught many analysts by surprise.

“It’s one of the toughest decisions that the AU has made,” said Patrick Smith, editor of The Africa Report. “Everyone laughs at the AU, and the criticisms are valid of course, but this sends a signal about the disapprobation from Africa. Monday’s massacre in Sudan happened on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and China, Russia, India had nothing to say about it. The linking of Monday’s massacre with the decision [to suspend Sudan] is a clear statement about the disapproval from Africa.”

The censure didn’t just stop at suspension. In an excoriating, 14-point communique, the AU demanded “the immediate resumption of negotiations, without preconditions, between all Sudanese stakeholders” and warned that if the military failed to hand over power to a “civilian-led” transitional authority, the bloc would, “automatically impose punitive measures on individuals and entities obstructing the establishment” of a transitional authority.

Shortly after the decision was announced on the Twitter account of the AU’s Peace and Security Council (PSC) -- the bloc’s equivalent of the UN’s Security Council – social media sites erupted with messages of gratitude from opposition supporters inside the country as well as the vast Sudanese diaspora displaced over decades of authoritarian rule.

“Doing the rounds: Thank you African Union, Damn you Arab League,” tweeted a former Sudanese journalist in Arabic and English.

UN passes the buck

For nearly six months, a mass but loose opposition movement across the country staged a model protest campaign, with members careful to stress that the Sudanese people appreciated international support, but were not seeking any foreign intervention in their quest for democratic freedom after 30 years of Islamist autocracy.

But following the April 11 ouster of strongman Omar al-Bashir and the formation of a Transitional Military Council (TMC), regional powers have played a disturbing and critical role in the Sudan crisis.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt were widely believed to be supporting the TMC in the military council’s bid to sideline civilian participation in the transition process.

The June 3 massacre occurred just days after Sudan’s top military leaders, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – a reviled former Janjaweed commander widely known by his nickname “Hemedti” – returned from trips to the UAE and Saudi Arabia respectively.

The scale of the crackdown – including bodies dumped in the Nile River, widespread rape reports and shutting down of hospitals – shocked the international community, sparking condemnations from a number of Western countries as well as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

But a UN Security Council bid to issue a statement condemning the killings failed on Tuesday, when China and Russia blocked the move at a closed door session.

China objected to the proposed text calling on Sudan's military rulers and protesters to ""continue working together towards a consensual solution to the current crisis"". Russia meanwhile insisted that the council should await a response from the AU, diplomats at the session told the AFP.

“The UN finds it easier to have AU cover. It’s a tactical approach because they don’t want to be seen as streaming into Africa. Their position is, let’s use the organs based in Africa, if the position spins out of control, it becomes a UN Security Council matter. But for the moment, the UN views the situation as an internal dispute,” explained Smith.

For over half-a-century, China has adopted a non-interference in the internal affairs of member states policy -- one mirrored by countries like India -- that is designed to deter international scrutiny of Beijing’s and New Delhi’s internal human rights abuses, particularly in troubled provinces.

But for the AU, the stakes are higher and closer to home.

Dangerous divisions within security ranks

Monday’s brutal crackdown -- which saw Bashir-era atrocities that were perpetuated in areas such as Darfur unleashed in the heart of the capital, Khartoum – has exposed the dangerous divisions within Sudan’s vast security-intelligence establishment.

The Sudanese regular army comprises around 80,000 troops, but under Bashir, they were sidelined by the powerful National Intelligence Security Services (NISS), whose troop figures are not public, but whose arsenal – including tanks, armoured carriers and attack helicopters – have been on display in security crackdowns in the hinterlands of Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Kodorfan.

Meanwhile Sudan’s deputy military leader Dagalo commands the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary force that merged militia groups such as the Janjaweed, which committed war crimes in Darfur. Dagalo is an immensely rich man, who has business interests in the gold mining sector and has been handsomely remunerated for his troop provisions in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. His irregular fighters are also better paid and equipped than regular forces, sparking resentment among army ranks, who regard RSF troops as unprofessional hicks.

Ever since a massive protest camp was set up outside the Alqiyada al Amaah military headquarters complex in Khartoum in early April, protesters have repeatedly told journalists that lower and mid-level army soldiers and junior officers are “with the people”. Senior officers who have benefited from Bashir-era patronage networks are believed to have a vested interest in the country’s security services retaining power.

Following the June 3 crackdown by RSF forces, reports of differences among security services ranks have increased, raising the prospect of armed men turning on each other and a likely descent into civil war.

“One reason why the AU took a tougher line is because they were starting to see the real situation on the ground go very badly. The AU does not want another Libya and it does not want to be held responsible for not acting when they should have,” said Smith.

AU attempts to fulfill its mandate despite the odds

Since the April 11 ouster of Bashir, the AU’s Peace and Security Council has attempted to uphold the Sudanese people’s democratic aspirations. But the 15-member council’s efforts have been stymied by Egypt, who currently holds the 55-member bloc’s rotating presidency.

Negotiations between the TMC and the opposition started floundering in late April over the make-up of a joint military-civilian council to administer the country until elections are held.

The opposition umbrella Declaration for Freedom and Change (DFC) wanted more civilian members as well as a civilian head of the joint council. Another key DFC demand has been a three-year transition period to ensure a genuine political change, not just a takeover by cronies of the old regime in new guises.

But Egyptian President Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi succeeded in maneuvering in favour of Sudan’s military leaders by giving the TMC additional time for a power handover to civilians.

On April 15, just days after Bashir’s ouster, the AU’s Peace and Security Council issued a communique calling on the Sudanese military to “hand over power to a transitional civilian-led political authority” within a “maximum period” of 15 days.

But a week later, Sisi convened a meeting in Cairo of select African heads of state, which recommended a handover extension to three months.

Following sustained Egyptian pressure on AU members, the Peace and Security Council on April 30 extended the deadline for an additional 60 days, an extra two-month compromise that undermined the bloc’s role as a promoter of democratic principles on the continent.

Thursday’s suspension of Sudan from the AU represents another effort by the Peace and Security Council to support Sudan’s return to constitutional order and rejecting “the unilateral actions taken by the Transitional Military Council, notably the suspension of dialogue with other Sudanese stakeholders”.

While Egypt holds the current AU presidency, it is not a member of the Peace and Security Council. The AU is made up of different bodies, including the PSC, which is led by former Chadian prime minister, Moussa Faki Mahamat. Under AU rules, the council’s two-seats for the Northern African region are currently held by Algeria and Morocco.

Egypt’s Sisi plays spoiler

Sisi is unlikely to take kindly to Sudan’s suspension from the AU for political and personal reasons.

The Egyptian general-turned-president is a close associate of Sudan’s military ruler, Burhan, since the two men were classmates at a Cairo military academy.

Sisi has also experienced an AU suspension: shortly after he ousted the country’s only democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013, the AU suspended Egypt for breaking constitutional order. The suspension ended a year later after Egypt held elections and passed a new constitution.

The spectre of Egypt has haunted the Sudanese opposition since the current protest movement began in December, with “No to the Egyptian outcome” and “Victory or Egypt” turning into popular chants at the Khartoum sit-in.

But parallels between the crackdowns on Cairo’s Tahrir Square and the Khartoum sit-in as well as the promotion of army generals to power have increased fears that the Egyptian outcome will be Sudan’s fate.

The AU’s temporary suspension of Egypt only to re-admit the country a year later after a compromised election exposes the limits of the African bloc.

“The suspension is the strongest display of collective multilateral action regarding the situation in Sudan. But it doesn’t ensure that it will have an impact on decisions made by the TMC and other parties in Khartoum. Suspensions from multilateral organisations have happened elsewhere in the past and they have not necessarily had the desired effect,” said Richard Barltrop, a UK-based Sudan expert and author of “Darfur and the International Community”.

Most analysts believe Sisi will continue to support a fellow military man in power in Egypt’s southern neighbour. “Sisi can still try to stymie the process,” said Smith. “But there’s been a dynamic difference after the massacre. No one is inclined to give the military a chance.”

All eyes on Ethiopia's Abiy

The international community has also been forced to up the ante following Monday’s massacre.

Britain this week summoned the Sudanese ambassador in London to raise concerns about the violence while US undersecretary David Hayes had phone conversations with Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman as well as Emirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash over the Sudan situation this week. The US State Department’s public announcements of the phone calls were taken as a sign in policy circles that Washington -- which has appeared disengaged in African affairs since Donald Trump’s election – is engaging in the Sudan crisis.

The diplomatic spotlight right now is on Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s visit on Friday to Sudan, where he met with Burhan in a bid to broker a deal between the country’s military rulers and the opposition.

With his track record of political reforms in Ethiopia and a peace deal with Eritrea, Abiy is viewed as a credible third party negotiator in the Sudan conflict. “He’s a respected leader in the region, he’s managed his own incredibly complex transition and he’s one of the few leaders who could get an ear from the opposition and the military,” said Smith.

There’s little doubt that Abiy, or anyone in the international community, will have an uphill task convincing Sudan’s military bosses to handover power to civilian leadership and quit stalling the transition process until international attention shifts elsewhere.

The wealth and power of men like Hemedti is also a major challenge to resolving the current crisis. But the AU has shown that it’s come a long way from the “dictators’ club” moniker the bloc once had. Resource scarcity continues to plague the 55-member bloc and like all multilateral organisations, the AU’s activities are constrained by the geopolitical imperatives of its individual members. But the Sudan crisis has shown that Africa is ready to take ownership of its crises and try to realise the democratic hopes of the African people on the ground.","The African Union’s suspension of Sudan over a paramilitary massacre of civilians this week has been welcomed by the international community.

1,Trump suspends tariffs on Mexico after deal on immigration reached,News Wires,"Jorge Duenes, Reuters | ¬ Trucks wait in queue for border customs control, to cross into the U.S., at the Otay border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico June 7, 2019.

President Donald Trump says he has suspended plans to impose tariffs on Mexico, tweeting that the country ""has agreed to take strong measures"" to stem the flow of Central American migrants into the United States.

""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico,"" Trump tweeted Friday night, saying the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

He said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.""

He said details would be released soon by the State Department.

I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended. Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to.... Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2019

The tweet marked a change in tone from earlier Friday, when his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters in Ireland before Trump took off: ""Our position has not changed. The tariffs are going forward as of Monday."" Trump has often said unpredictability helps him negotiate.

A tax on all Mexican goods , which would increase every month up to 25% under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts.

Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies have urged him to reconsider or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.

U.S. and Mexican officials held a third day of talks at the U.S. State Department trying to hash out a deal that would satisfy Trump's demand that Mexico dramatically increase its efforts to crack down on migrants.

The talks were said to be focused, in part, on attempting to reach a compromise on changes that would make it harder for migrants who pass through Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S., those monitoring the situation said.

Mexico has opposed such a change but appeared open to considering a potential compromise that could include exceptions or waivers for different types of cases.

Trump has nonetheless embraced tariffs as a political tool he can use to force countries to comply with his demands in this case on his signature issue of immigration.

And he appeared poised earlier Friday to invoke an emergency declaration that would allow him to put the tariffs into effect if that is his final decision, according to people monitoring the talks.

""If negotiations continue to go well,"" Trump ""can turn that off at some point over the weekend,"" Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, told reporters.

Talks had gotten off to a shaky start Wednesday, as the U.S. once again pressed Mexico to step up enforcement on its southern border with Guatemala and to enter into a ""safe third country agreement"" overhauling its asylum system.

But as talks progressed Thursday, U.S. officials began to grow more optimistic, with Short reporting Mexican ""receptivity"" to potential asylum changes.

Still, he said there was ""a long way to go in that particular piece.""

In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador would not say whether he would accept his country agreeing to be a ""safe third country.""

""That is being looked at,"" he said Friday morning during his daily news conference, where he held out hope a deal could be reached before Monday's deadline.

In addition, Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Thursday his country had agreed to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops to its border with Guatemala to help control the flow of migrants as part of its concessions.

He tweeted late Friday that there would be no ""tariff application on Monday.""

""Thanks to all the people who have supported us by realizing the greatness of Mexico,"" he wrote.

Beyond Trump and several White House advisers, few in his administration believe the tariffs are a good idea, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.

Those people worry about the negative economic consequences for Americans and believe the tariffs - which would likely spark retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports - would also hurt the administration politically.

Republicans in Congress have warned the White House that they are ready to stand up to the president to try to block his tariffs, which they worry would spike costs to U.S. consumers, harm the economy and imperil a major pending U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal .

2,Venezuela's Maduro says border with Colombia to reopen,News Wires,"Luisa Gonzalez, REUTERS | A Colombian army member observes the passage of people on the Simon Bolivar international bridge, Colombia May 3, 2019. This is one of the main bridges that Maduro ordered to reopen.

Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Friday ordered the reopening of the country’s border with Colombia in western Tachira state, near where international aid refused by Caracas has amassed.

The economically-devastated South American nation is suffering from shortages of food, medicine and other essentials amid a power struggle between Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries including the United States.

Announcing the reopening of the frontier on Twitter, Maduro said: “We are a people of peace that strongly defends our independence and self-determination.”

The full text of his tweet reads: “Exercising our sovereignty, I have ordered the opening of the border crossings with Colombia in Táchira State, starting this Saturday #8Jun. We are a people of peace that strongly defends our independence and self-determination.”

En ejercicio pleno de nuestra soberanía, he ordenado la apertura de los pasos fronterizos con Colombia en el Estado Táchira, a partir de este sábado #8Jun. Somos un pueblo de paz que defiende firmemente nuestra independencia y autodeterminación. Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) June 7, 2019

The leader, however, did not say whether crucial border bridges, closed since August 2015 after two Venezuelan soldiers were wounded by suspected smugglers, would be unblocked.

In February, Maduro ordered the total closure of land frontiers with Brazil and Colombia, as well as sea and air links with the Netherlands Antilles in the Caribbean.

'Economic war'

Guaido wanted to bring food and medicine into the country, but the Maduro-backed army blocked the border bridges and prevented the entry of cargo.

Maduro says Venezuela is the victim of an “economic war” waged by the United States and believes the aid was a smoke screen to prepare a “foreign invasion”.

The Venezuelan government in May reopened its land border with Brazil and the sea route with Aruba, but not with other islands such as Bonaire and Curacao.

Relations between Venezuela and Colombia, who share a land border stretching 2,220 kilometres, have been broken since February 23 after Colombian President Ivan Duque announced his support for Guaido.

Many Venezuelans cross the frontier illegally every day to get supplies because of the serious shortage of basic necessities.

3,Chelsea icon Hazard joins Real Madrid for Zidane re-build,News Wires,"Real Madrid ended their long pursuit of Eden Hazard on Friday when they agreed to sign the Belgium winger from Chelsea on a five-year contract for a reported 100 million euros ($113.34 million), making him their joint-record signing.

ADVERTISING Read more

Real said Hazard, 28, had signed a five-year contract.

His contract at the Premier League club was due to expire next year but the Blues drove a hard bargain for the forward, who will reportedly cost Madrid an initial 100 million euros ($113 million), with another 45 million in potential add-ons.

The full amount would trump the 101 million euros Madrid paid Tottenham for Gareth Bale and the 91 million euros they spent to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United.

An unveiling at the Santiago Bernabeu is expected next week, once Hazard returns from international duty with Belgium, who play Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kazakhstan on Saturday and Scotland on Tuesday.

It means Madrid's spending spree is picking up pace following the arrivals of defender Eder Militao and striker Luka Jovic from Porto and Eintracht Frankfurt respectively.

But Hazard is the gem Zinedine Zidane can build his new team around and brings the kind of stardust Madrid fans have craved ever since the sale of Ronaldo to Juventus last summer.

Ronaldo's departure created a void up front that Madrid failed to fill last season, the team struggling for goals en route to finishing 19 points behind Barcelona in La Liga and crashing out to Ajax in the last 16 of the Champions League.

Hazard, who scored 110 goals in seven seasons at Chelsea, will be expected to help plug the gap has long-been admired by Zidane and Madrid president Florentino Perez.

""We have wanted to sign Hazard for several years and I hope he will come this year,"" Perez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero last month.

Less clear is where Hazard will fit into Zidane's starting line-up. Assuming he plays in his favoured position on the left of a front three, it would mean displacing the 18-year-old Brazilian, Vinicius Junior, who enjoyed a brilliant breakthrough year last season.

Chelsea said the club had tried to persuade Hazard to stay.

""Although it is with sadness we say goodbye to Eden - and we made it absolutely clear to him the club wished him to stay - we respect the decision he has made to take on a new challenge in a different country and follow his childhood dream of playing for Real Madrid,"" Chelsea club director Marina Granovskaia said in a statement.

Bale doubt

Hazard's arrival also adds more uncertainty around the future of Gareth Bale, who has played both on the left and right of the attacking trio in recent months but is clearly not part of Zidane's plans.

Madrid want to sell Bale to raise money for more signings, with French left-back Ferland Mendy the next player expected to arrive, from Lyon.

But the Wales international will not be forced out and has so far shown no interest in the handful of clubs that have shown interest. Neither Bale nor his agent Jonathan Barnett have spoken to the club since the end of the season.

Hazard though would do well to match Bale's record in Madrid as he looks to add to the trophies he won at Chelsea, which included two Premier League and two Europa League titles, as well as one FA Cup and one League Cup.

At the end of the 2014-15 season, in which Chelsea won the league, Hazard was awarded both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the Premier League Player of the Season. He was named in the PFA Premier League team of the year four times, in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017.

If Madrid pay the full amount, Chelsea stand to make a profit of more than 100 million euros, having signed Hazard for close to 40 million euros from Lille in 2012.

Chelsea had just won the Champions League when Hazard chose them over several other clubs but they have failed to replicate the success in the competition. After reaching the semi-finals in 2014, Chelsea have not gone past the last 16 in the last five seasons.

4,World Oceans Day: Scientists ‘taken aback by scale and speed of ocean changes’,News Wires,"Ted Alijibe, AFP | Volunteers remove rubbish washed ashore along the coastline of freedom island in Paranaque City, suburban Manila on June 8, 2013 during a coastal clean-up drive as part of the program on World Ocean Day.

Armed with better data than ever before, scientists have in recent months sounded the alarm over the rising pace of global warming and the parlous state of Nature.

ADVERTISING Read more

But there is another area of concern, one that covers two thirds of the planet and plays a crucial role in absorbing dangerous greenhouse gases and regulating everything from food chains to weather patterns.

Oceans are crucial to life on Earth, yet they frequently only feature in the environment debate when plastic pollution or fish-stock declines are discussed.

But experts believe that might be changing.

“We have an important opportunity over the next 18 months to do something for oceans,” said Dan Laffoley, from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which released a landmark report in October 2018 warning of the effects of global temperature rises, will this September publish its latest assessment on the state of oceans.

“The IPCC report will be fairly grim,” said Lisa Speer, director of the international oceans programme at the Natural Resources Defence Council.

As greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere climb ever higher, so do sea-levels; oceans currently encroach on the land around 3.3 millimetres (0.13 inches) a year, and the rate is accelerating.

The last IPCC assessment, in 2014, predicted that sea levels could rise as much as one metre by the end of the century.

But more recent studies using more varied scenario planning have said that current warming trends could lift the seas as much as two metres by 2100.

Laffoley said there were four main threats, or ‘horsemen’, facing the world’s oceans: surface warming, ocean heating, deoxygenation and acidification.

“We scientists are taken aback by the scale, depth and speed of the change,” he said ahead of World Oceans Day on Saturday.

Sea sick

Oceans absorb around a third of all manmade CO2, and 90 percent of the excess heat created by those emissions goes into the sea.

In doing so, the ocean surface heats and becomes more acidic, something that has already decimated coral populations on reefs throughout the seas.

Oceans contain 97 percent of all living space on Earth and, just like forests, they help keep the atmosphere breathable. But there is a limit to how much CO2 they can absorb.

“Every second breath we take comes from oxygen produced by the ocean, so it’s time for us to make some radical changes,” said Peter Thomson, UN special envoy for oceans.

Activists and monitors hope that the IPCC oceans report will spark similar alarm among policymakers that its climate assessment did last year.

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, whose country will host the COP25 UN climate summit in December, has dedicated the conference to oceans.

“It will stay in our memories as the blue COP,” he said this year.

‘A win-win-win’

While environmentalists have welcomed the increasing political attention on oceans, they stress that concrete action is needed to arrest the rapid damage spreading through the seas.

Countries must « introduce measures related to oceans in their national commitments » to battle climate change, according to Raphael Cuvelier, projects coordinator at the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, which focuses on oceans.

“Working for the preservation and appreciation of marine ecosystems is working for the climate,” he said.

In particular, conservationists want governments to extend protected areas to allow species to recover.

“Living areas in the oceans are shrinking,” said Callum Roberts, an oceanologist at the University of York.

“We are seeing how larger marine protected areas can reverse these trends. We can counteract the changes caused by climate change.”

Other experts stress the importance of what is known as ‘blue carbon’ the amount of CO2 absorbed by ocean plants such as seagrass and mangroves.

A diplomat involved in the UN climate change discussion said preserving areas rich in blue carbon was beneficial for both the climate and humanity.

“There are significant synergies between climate change mitigation, with carbon storage, and adaptation, looking at the importance of mangroves in protecting against storms and rising sea levels, as well as for biodiversity,” he said.

“It’s a win-win-win.”

5,Hosts France top South Korea 4-0 in Women's Football World Cup opener,News Wires,"Lucy Nicholson, Reuters | France's Wendie Renard celebrates scoring their third goal against South Korea with Kadidiatou Diani and Amandine Henry in the opening game of the Women’s World Cup at the Parc des Princes in Paris on June 7, 2019.

Hosts France laid down a marker in the opening game of the women’s World Cup as towering defender Wendie Renard scored twice in a rampant 4-0 win over South Korea to kick off the tournament in style in Paris on Friday.

A sell-out crowd of 45,261 filled the Parc des Princes to watch the start of what is billed as the biggest women’s World Cup yet, but there was no sign of the pressure getting to the French on the big occasion.

Les Bleues are among the favourites to win the trophy on home soil and they showed no mercy to the Koreans, with the prolific Eugenie Le Sommer giving them an early lead and Renard the tallest player at the tournament twice heading home before the interval.

Captain Amandine Henry, impressive throughout, wrapped up the win late on in this Group A encounter.

The display was watched by France’s President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte, who were in the crowd alongside Gianni Infantino.

The FIFA chief had this week promised the month-long tournament would see the “explosion” of the women’s game as he was waved in for a second term at the head of world football’s governing body. Almost a million tickets have been sold for matches in the nine host cities.

This was certainly a fine start, despite the unseasonably cold Parisian evening, with the French showing their credentials having been set the target by their own federation of going all the way to the final in Lyon on July 7.

The problem for Corinne Diacre’s team is that, if they win their group, they could well end up facing reigning champions the United States back in Paris in the quarter-finals.

The USA, whose legal battle to be paid the same as their male counterparts has made waves in the run-up to the tournament, start their campaign against Thailand on Tuesday in Reims.

Ranked fourth in the world, the French have underperformed at recent major tournaments, losing in the quarter-finals of the last World Cup, Euro 2017 and the last Olympics.

Diacre is relying on a core of players from Lyon, Europe’s leading club side who won a fourth successive Champions League title last month.

VAR plays role

There were seven Lyon players in the French starting line-up here, and two of them combined for the ninth-minute opener, captain Henry with the low ball into the box for Le Sommer to fire in off the crossbar. It was Le Sommer’s 75th goal for her country.

South Korea were hardly able to get out of their own half, with their star player, Chelsea’s Ji So-yun, barely touching the ball.

France thought they had a second before the half-hour mark when Renard’s header down was hooked into the net by her fellow centre-back Griedge Mbock, but after the celebrations had finally died down, the goal was disallowed for an extremely tight offside following a VAR review.

The 1.87 metre Renard was not to be denied, however, as she headed in Gaetane Thiney’s corner from the right in the 35th minute to make it 2-0.

She did it again in first-half stoppage time, this time heading in a corner from the other side by Amel Majri.

Korea can count themselves lucky that this did not turn into a full-blown rout, although the excellent Henry curled in a delightful fourth from 20 yards with five minutes left.

6,Thousands protest in Liberia against President Weah,News Wires,"Carielle Doe, AFP | Demonstrators hold a poster portraying Liberian President George Weah as they gather outside the Liberian Mansion in Monrovia on June 7, 2019 during an anti-government march to protest at inflation and corruption.

Thousands of Liberians took to the streets of the capital, Monrovia, on Friday to protest against the corruption and economic decline that many blame on their once hugely popular president, former football star George Weah.

In a stark contrast to the wild celebrations that greeted Weah’s election victory in 2017, throngs of chanting demonstrators bearing signs calling Weah a “traitor” gathered near the president’s official residence.

Among protesters’ main gripes: a stagnant economy in which most still live in deep poverty and a scandal in which the country last year lost $100 million in newly printed bank notes destined for the central bank.

“Weah is not governing our state the right way,” said Ishmael Hassan, who voted for Weah in 2017 but has since become disillusioned. “The economic situation in our country is going down the drain.”

Liberia’s economy was hit hard by a 2014-16 Ebola outbreak that killed thousands, low prices for its chief exports, iron ore and rubber, and declining foreign aid.

The International Monetary Fund in March revised down Liberia’s economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0.4% from 4.7%. Inflation peaked at 28.5% in December, pushing up the price of everyday items.

Corruption allegations

Many believed Weah, who grew up in a Monrovia slum before becoming a celebrated striker in some of Europe’s biggest football teams, would bring a new dawn. Instead, he faces the same criticisms of corruption that dogged his predecessor Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

A petition delivered by the protest’s organizers to Justice Minister Frank Musa Dean on Friday accused the administration of misusing public funds, violating press freedoms, and failing to adequately fund health and education programs.

The petition accuses Weah himself of constructing “scores of luxury homes” after he declined to publicly declare his assets.

“I supported this government, but the way things are going, we want to save the state,” said protestor Bob Blue.

7,UK’s PM May quits as party leader triggering disruptive succession race,News Wires,"British Prime Minister Theresa May steps down as leader of her Conservative Party on Friday, formally triggering the race for a successor who will try where she failed to deliver Brexit.

ADVERTISING Read more

May will remain prime minister until a new leader is chosen, likely in late July, but has relinquished control over the direction of Britain's tortuous departure from the European Union.

Brexit is still scheduled for October 31 but while her rivals thrash it out, the project remains stuck, with the only divorce plan agreed with Brussels stuck in parliament.

May took office after the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU and has spent the past three years working on the plan, delaying Brexit twice to try to get it through.

France 24’s Keating: ‘Frustration in Brussels’

But she finally acknowledged defeat in a tearful resignation speech last month, the culmination of months of political turmoil that has slowly sapped all her authority.

Eleven Conservative MPs are currently vying to replace her, including former foreign minister Boris Johnson, but some are expected to drop out before Monday's deadline for nominations.

The winner will have only a few months to decide whether to try to salvage May's plan, delay Brexit again -- or sever ties with Britain's closest trading partner with no agreement at all.

They are under pressure from eurosceptic figurehead Nigel Farage, who has called for a ""no deal"" option and whose Brexit party topped European polls last month.

His party made a strong showing in by-election for the British parliament in the eastern city of Peterborough on Thursday, but failed in its goal of winning its first MP.

However, the pro-European Liberal Democrats, who want to reverse Brexit, also performed well in the European polls, highlighting how divided Britain remains over its future.

Power shift

May will formally relinquish her leadership in a private letter to her party on Friday, but no official events are planned to mark the day.

She put on a brave face this week when hosting US President Donald Trump for a state visit, before joining him and other world leaders to mark 75 years since the D-day landings.

But Trump used the trip to speak with Johnson and other candidates to replace her, emphasising where the political power in Britain now lies.

""She remains prime minister for a good few weeks yet,"" May's spokesman insisted, noting that any successor must meet Queen Elizabeth II and assure the monarch they have the support of enough lawmakers to take over.

He said May would focus on domestic issues, but ""in relation to Brexit, the prime minister said it wouldn't be for her to take this process forward"".

Trump has been highly critical of May's Brexit strategy and ahead of his visit to Britain, urged her successor to leave the bloc with no deal if necessary.

Johnson, a leading campaigner in the 2016 referendum who quit the government last year over May's plan, is among several would-be candidates who say they are willing to do this.

But Environment Secretary Michael Gove, another frontrunner, is open to other Brexit delay, while Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said leaving with no deal is ""political suicide"".

Trump had a phone call with Johnson this week and met both Hunt and Farage, although a planned meeting with Gove never materialised.

Nominations for the contest must be submitted on Monday, and the 313 Conservative MPs -- including May -- will hold the first of a series of secret ballots on June 13.

With the worst performers eliminated each time, the goal is to have two candidates left by June 20. They will then be put to a ballot of an estimated 100,000 party members.

The contest should be completed by the week commencing July 22.

Clashes on the edge of the jihadist-controlled Idlib province have killed 44 government loyalists and 39 jihadists and Islamists since Thursday, the Observatory said.

The Syrian government and its Russian backer in April launched an intensified offensive in the last stronghold of both the rebel and the jihadist groups. The offensive has resulted in the deaths of up to 300 people, including 40 children over the past month.

Idlib is a region of some three million people, almost half of whom have been displaced from other parts of Syria.

Eight years into Syria’s civil war, the region is the last to remain beyond regime control apart from a large northeastern swathe held by the country’s Kurds.

The war, which started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government demonstrations, has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions.

11,Putting the ‘African’ back in West African wax print fabrics,Frank Hersey,"Frank Hersey, FMM | A range of colourful textiles, known as pagnes, on display in Ivory Coast's main city Abidjan for 'National Pagne Day'.

The European monopoly on wax print textiles in Central and West African markets is being undermined by Chinese companies. But now designers in Ivory Coast are embracing traditional patterns in a bid to reclaim their past.

ADVERTISING Read more

The colourful printed fabrics synonymous with West and Central Africa are falling out of favour as the textiles market sees some of its biggest changes since European firms introduced wax-block printing 150 years ago. As the leading European brands thwart Chinese competition, persistent high prices and a reappraisal of identity mean people in Ivory Coast are turning to traditional fabrics instead.

Despite being mass-produced, the wax-printed fabrics made by Anglo-Dutch manufacture Vlisco Group cost more per yard than fabrics handmade by Ivory Coast’s weavers. Discontent over the high prices has been exacerbated by accusations that the Vlisco Group engages in monopolistic marketplace abuses.

The country’s association of small traders, FENACCI, claims the company ruthlessly enforces anti-counterfeit measures to keep prices high and prevents competition from Chinese competitors. The high prices charged for ‘African fabrics’ by foreign companies are part of the argument for promoting traditional craft, along with job creation and heritage protection.

First the colonisers, then the Chinese

The bold, bright fabrics associated with West and Central Africa, known as pagne, are in fact something of a newcomer to the region. Based on Indonesian batik techniques, their mass production was perfected by the Dutch and British in the colonial era. From the 1870s, the fabrics were sold on African markets via local female distributors, who also passed back vital market and design information.

A century later, Chinese manufacturers arrived on the scene, mimicking the European pagnes.

“In those days it was very easy to see a fake because they hadn't mastered the very unique method of wax printing,” Aiwan Obinyan, a British-Nigerian documentary maker, told FRANCE 24. “But with time, they've become better and mastered the technology. It's very hard now to see the difference between a Chinese copy and the original Dutch wax or English wax.”

Chinese competition, initially in the form of counterfeits, but now also designs in their own right, has proven problematic for Vlisco Group. It has fought back with training for customs officials, new printing techniques, market research and marketing.

Tight grip

The streets of Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial capital, are adorned with advertising for the latest designs from Uniwax. All the major brands – Uniwax, Vlisco, Woodin and GTP – belong to the same company, Netherlands-based Vlisco Group, which was acquired by UK private equity firm Actis for $151 million in 2010. Its brands are made in the Netherlands (Vlisco), Ivory Coast (Uniwax) and Ghana (Woodin and GTP).

“Vlisco is constantly sending their marketing team to Africa and they're sitting down with women in markets, they're asking questions,” says Obinyan. “They're even sending their designers there to gain inspiration”.

Speaking to FRANCE 24 on the sidelines of a traditional weaving demonstration on National Pagne Day, Chantal Guiraud, president of FITT, the Ivorian Federation of Traditional Textiles, noted that, “When you compare [traditional pagnes] to wax fabrics by Uniwax and Vlisco – those are pagnes that might be made in Africa, but they’re not African. In reality, it’s not us here on the ground doing the designs. They might have the patterns of traditional pagnes, but those patterns typically belong to the regions of Ivory Coast.”

Guiraud is pushing for more craftspeople to register their designs amid complaints that traditional designs have not only been registered by European brands, but also copied by Chinese manufacturers.

“All the Ivory Coast designs are intellectual property, but what I don’t understand is, how the copying countries can go on copying. Why does nobody do anything?” she asks.

Typical prices for a complete pagne range from around 30,000 CFA francs (46 euros) at Woodin to 45,000 CFA francs (€67) at Vlisco. High quality Chinese wax-print brands such as Hi Target retail for around 6-8,000 CFA francs (€9-12). Hand spun, handwoven traditional pagne cost around 30,000 CFA francs for the equivalent length, according to Guiraud, although silk costs 200,000 CFA francs (€305).

Farikou Soumahoro, president of the FENACCI small traders’ federation, claims these prices are out of reach for families “and to sort this situation out, traders have banded together and travelled to manufacturers abroad, in Asia, to be specific, to have pagnes made at a lower cost for the benefit of the people.”

Soumahoro believes shopkeepers are being unfairly punished for selling counterfeits.

“We’re importing these pagnes, paying the appropriate customs dues to clear customs and getting the goods to our shops,"" he says. ""Then this company comes along and removes the pagnes with I don’t know what as a warrant saying that the items are counterfeits.”

Shopkeepers we spoke to at a fabric market in Abidjan described how such raids happen.

“The pagnes come through the port and head to Adjamé to the wholesalers then distributors. But there’s never any problems at that level, just with us small traders,” one trader, who did not want to be identified, told FRANCE 24.

“Uniwax representatives come in plainclothes and look around at our pagnes then go off. They come back with the police and take what they want […] They take anything they say is counterfeit, but also any Chinese brands like Hi Target. There’s nothing we can do as they’re with the police,” said another. Such raids happen roughly every six months, he said. The story doesn’t end there. “The Uniwax reps then resell all the pagnes they’ve seized back onto the markets,” he claimed.

Uniwax declined to be interviewed or comment.

Somouhoro said in early May that his members had recently reported the seizure of 2,600 full pagnes in San Pedro, Port Pouet and Man and said he would seek the intervention of Ivorian Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly as a negotiator.

FENACCI’s previous legal action against Uniwax, the most prominent part of the Vlisco Group in Ivory Coast, has failed.

Traditional comeback

Events such as the weeklong National Pagne Day aim to promote traditional, locally produced textiles, sidestepping the issues of cost and identity.

“Traditional fabrics are being used more in African fashion and that’s what we’re trying to do with the Pagne Day,” says Guiraud, who is grateful for the promotional efforts of the Ministry of Culture.

Massiamy Ouattara, a costume maker and ambassador of Ivorian crafts, has observed the changes.

“Before, people wore a lot of wax print, and they still do, but you see people wearing traditional pagne much more than 30 or 40 years ago,” she explains. “Over the last 20 years it’s come into its own […] and is now being used in skirts, trousers, jackets and even hats.”

Ouattara’s own label was recognised by UNESCO for West African craftsmanship, and she hopes more financial backing will help craftspeople take their products to international markets.

“There’s a great future for these fabrics because Ivory Coast produces cotton,” she says. “Why don’t we be the creators who take the cotton produced by these women and turn it into pagne?”

Obinyan, the documentary maker, agrees with the importance of identity: ""We need to invest back into our own indigenous textiles and we need to take control of that – because we're never really going to fully own wax print because it was never fully ours to begin with.”","The European monopoly on wax print textiles in Central and West African markets is being undermined by Chinese companies.

12,Rich and poor increasingly segregated in Paris region,Claire Mufson,"Geoffroy Van der Hasselt, AFP | A public housing building in in Aulnay-sous-Bois, a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris.

Over months of Yellow Vest protests, public debate has centered on the urban rural divide and the resources eaten up by the Paris region of Île-de-France. But a new study shows that the country’s wealthiest region is also the most deeply unequal.

ADVERTISING Read more

The larger Paris region of Île-de-France is home to nearly 19 percent of the French population and represents 30 percent of the country’s GDP, but the report “Gentrification and growing poverty in the heart of Île-de-France” published Monday by the Planning and Urbanism Institute (IAU) shows that inequality has grown considerably since the early 2000s.

“With the Yellow Vest movement, there has been a lot of talk about poverty as a rural problem, as if cities are always better off,” the report’s author Mariette Sagot told FRANCE 24. “But that’s not true. There are poor suburban and rural areas, but deep poverty remains an urban phenomenon.”

Her study of household income data from 2001 to 2015 paints a startling picture of deepening inequality and entrenched segregation in the country’s largest metropolis.

Wealthiest and poorest more isolated

“What we’ve seen since 2010 in particular is a further concentration of wealth in the wealthy areas, while poverty has become more entrenched in the poorest areas,” said Sagot. The wealthy are particularly likely to live among themselves.

Half of the wealthiest households (the top 10 percent) live in just 26 of Île-de-France’s 1276 communes.

Meanwhile the overall poverty rate in Île-de-France hit 15.9 percent in 2015, up from 12.3 percent nine years earlier.

The poorest areas are seeing “a concentration of underqualified workers, often immigrants, with higher rates of unemployment or of precarious employment, and a growing number of single-parent households that have contributed to stigmatisation and deteriorating economic conditions,” emphasised the report.

Gentrification and the fractured urban fabric

With housing prices as high as 11,000 €/sqm in the most desirable neighbourhoods, young professionals and higher income households are moving to traditionally middle- and lower-class areas in Paris and its near suburbs.

“When we see prices rise 14 percent in the 19e arrondissement (a district on the northeastern edge of Paris), it’s not because people there are making more money,” Bertrand Savouré, president of the Greater Paris Accountants told Le Parisien newspaper. “It’s new populations moving in.”

But gentrification is not uniform in these towns. Middle- and high-income residents move to the neighbourhoods with easy access to Paris, parks, the river or wealthier areas, reproducing on a neighbourhood scale the segregation patterns of the larger metropolis.

“There is growing inequality within these peripheral mixed-income communes. The urban fabric is increasingly fragmented and segregated with some neighbourhoods growing wealthier while others are growing poorer,” said Sagot.

For example, in the town of Montreuil, on the eastern edge of Paris, the streets closest to the capital have grown more expensive, while conditions “are deteriorating in the east”, according to the report.

Traditionally modest suburban neighbourhoods with the best access to transportation links have gentrified significantly, but neighbouring areas have become poorer, with purchasing power down nearly 6 percent in communes like Saint-Ouen just north of Paris.

Housing as a social marker

As housing prices tripled between 1999 and 2018, housing has become a greater indicator of economic status, with home owners growing richer and public housing residents growing poorer compared to the average household.

Mobility in the housing market is also down. High housing prices and low economic mobility mean that populations in rich and poor areas are crystalising as people stay in their homes for longer.

Families are less likely to have moved in the last two years, particularly if they live in public housing. Social housing, once considered a stepping stone to home ownership or renting on the private market, has become permanent for many.

Thanks to a French law that requires many jurisdictions maintain a 25 percent public housing stock, poorer populations are not moving further out of the city. Those who move to distant suburbs, said Sagot, are middle-income families with young children who want single-family homes and more space.

Her study, she says, shows the importance of considering systemic inequalities within smaller communities instead of broader comparisons between urban and rural or semi-rural areas.","Geoffroy Van der Hasselt, AFP | A public housing building in in Aulnay-sous-Bois, a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris.

The experiment “will be set up very quickly in the coming weeks,” confirmed Jean-Baptiste Moreau, LREM’s (The Republic on the move) MP contacted by FRANCE 24. He supports legalising medical marijuana. “The challenge is ensuring a French supply chain for the production [of these pharmaceutical products]”.

He hopes his district of La Creuse, where elected officials are trying to boost the local economy and asked in 2018 for a government’s permit to cultivate and produce medical-grade cannabis, will benefit from it.

A tightly controlled experiment

But lucrative business opportunities could still be a long way off. “For the moment, medical cannabis production is not authorised in France,” said Authier. Furthermore, he continued, “[the crops] will be grown in closed fields or greenhouses and will require significant investment. We will have to control the temperature, humidity and sunshine. It isn’t conventional agriculture"".

During the trial period, which could last until mid-2021, “we will probably need to import pharmaceutical products [from countries where medical cannabis is legal] until a French supply chain is set up”, said Authier.

French producers will not only need to learn to grow the crop but to comply with European rules for producing medicine of a consistent quality.

The use of medical cannabis will be strictly controlled. Doctors will be permitted to prescribe it only as “a last resort, after trying other available therapeutic [pain] treatments”, said Authier. In December 2018, the National Agency for the Safety of Health Products identified possible applications for medical cannabis: cancer, certain types of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, palliative care, and pain that does not respond to usual treatments.

“We will probably need to widen the scope of eligible illnesses,” Senator Esther Benbassa (of the Greens party), who opened the Senate debate on May 28, told FRANCE 24.

No legalisation for recreational use

Senators of the Républicains party are worried that medical cannabis is a “Trojan horse”, the beginning of a slippery slope towards legalising marijuana for recreational use. Authier does not share their concerns: “There is little risk that medical cannabis will be abused for recreational purposes. […] It has different users with different objectives. Those who take codeine for pain and those who smoke opium are taking the same substance but they don’t have the same purpose. Similarly, medical-grade cannabis will not satisfy those looking for psychoactive effects.”

There will be, for example, less THC – the most abundant cannabinoid and the most present in the cannabis plant – in medical cannabis than in the cannabis smoked regularly by 11 percent of French people aged 18 to 64, according to the French Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction.

The upcoming regulatory changes – pending the ministry of health’s approval – will allow only for medical experimentation, not for random consumption.

“Therapeutic cannabis is not a drug, it is medication,” says Authier. “The question of legalisation won’t come up before 2021, and only following this experiment.”

But MP Moreau is open to the idea of legalisation for recreational use. He said he plans to propose an investigation into other uses of cannabis in France. “For now, we are talking about medical cannabis, but eventually we will have to consider wellness cannabis [oils, vitamins and supplements with very low levels of THC].”

17,Will Les Bleues win the World Cup at last?,Stéphanie Trouillard,"A year after France’s men won the World Cup, its women now hope to do the same. The title has always eluded them in the past, so what are the odds they will win this year?

ADVERTISING Read more

Les Bleues kick off the Women’s World Cup – the first to be held on French soil – at 9pm (GMT +2) on Friday during an opening match against South Korea at the Parc des Princes stadium in the southwest of Paris.

Ranked fourth in the world by FIFA, the pressure is on France to perform. The tournament comes after the men’s team won their second World Cup last year, and fans are eager to see the women take the title.

France coach Corinne Diacre has made no secret that she shares her supporters’ ambitions.

“For me, it would be a real failure if we don’t make it to the finals,” the former player said. “I’m not afraid, even if it is a lofty goal.”

Dernière ligne droite avant la Coupe du Monde ! ✊🇫🇷 #FiersdetreBleues pic.twitter.com/wLj36MXfrA Equipe de France ⭐⭐ (@equipedefrance) May 27, 2019

String of defeats

Diacre hopes to erase the team’s past losses by finally placing a trophy on the mantel. In 2011, during the second time they qualified, France made it all the way to the semi-finals before they were knocked out by the United States (1-3). They then lost the third place playoff to Sweden (1-2) to come in fourth overall.

Four years later, they again missed their chance at World Cup glory after Germany beat them 5-4 on penalties (1-1 during extra time) in the quarter-finals.

The Olympics have been no kinder to France. They finished fourth at the 2012 Games in London. And in 2016, they were knocked-out during the quarter-finals by Canada (0-1).

Les Bleues’ bad luck has also dogged them at the European level. During the past three European championships, they have failed to make it past the quarter-finals.

An easy group?

Always a favourite, yet never champions; France are under tremendous pressure to deliver and finally join the ranks of the world’s best teams: the United States, Germany and Japan. This year’s squad is largely composed of players from Olympique Lyonnais, including the talented Amandine Henry, Eugénie Le Sommer, Wendie Renard and Amel Majri. Just last month, the team won the 6th UEFA Women’s Champions League.

At first glance, Les Bleues should easily dominate Group A, but their rivals could have some surprises in store. They first face-off against South Korea, ranked 14th in the world by FIFA. Although the Koreans have yet to advance beyond the final 16 in a World Cup competition, they are known for their intractable game and fierce defence.

France’s next match will be against Norway on June 12. Even if the Scandinavian team are playing without their star striker, Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg (who is in an ongoing dispute with the Norwegian Football Federation), Norway are undergoing something of a renaissance. The former World and Olympic champions have returned to form after years of disappointing performances.

Les Bleues’ final match in the opening group stage will be against Nigeria on June 17. Ranked 39th in the world by FIFA, the Super Falcons are three-time defending champions of the Africa Women Cup of Nations, and have qualified for every World Cup since the women’s competition began.

Injuries

Before the World Cup, France defeated Thailand (3-0) and China (2-1) during warm-up matches. The two games, however, took a physical toll on the team. Captain Amandine Henry was forced to watch the last match from the sidelines because of a back problem. She was joined on the bench by two other injured players: Eugénie Le Sommer and Amel Majri.

The roster of injured players has continued to grow in the run-up to the World Cup, but the team is not discouraged.

“Eugénie and Amel returned to the field [on Monday], and they will be able to play on Friday in the opening match. Amandine and [Griedge Mbock, who suffered a minor sprain] are also back, so there’s nothing to worry about. I hope they’ll be able to compete on Friday,” France goalie Sarah Bouhaddi said. “We’ve got a competitive group right now. If someone (can’t play), she will be replaced by someone else.”

Striker Gaëtane Thiney agreed with Bouhaddi’s assessment of the team.

“We’ve undergone serious athletic training to ensure we can make it through the entire competition. Coping with injury is a part of that. I can’t tell you how long it will last for, but we’re not in the least bit worried,” Thiney said.

Beyond the locker room drama, Les Bleues have to manage the pressures of playing at home.

“We feel it mounting, we’ve received a lot of letters of support. Our families will be there, and the media are increasingly present. It was already really intense during my debut World Cup competition in Germany in 2011. Here, playing at home, it’s way stronger,” defender Wendie Renard said.

Most of the team, however, view the support as an advantage going into their opening match.

“It’s going to be an incredible day for the French national team, because it’s the start of the World Cup and we’ve been waiting for this for the past four years,” Thiney said. “The ambiance of this World Cup match will be different from what we’re used to and it will give us a boost by allowing us to perform even better.”

A total of seven matches stand between Les Bleues and their ultimate goal. Until then, it remains to be seen whether they will advance to the World Cup final on July 7 at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Lyon.","A year after France’s men won the World Cup, its women now hope to do the same.

The wife of Turkey's culture and tourism ministry has drawn widespread criticism after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself handing a young girl a $100 bill as the latter kisses her hand.Social media users expressed distaste for Pervin Ersoy's display of wealth amid the economic crisis engulfing the country and the government's claim to represent the working class.The photo, which was since been deleted, was taken at the five-star Maxx Royal Kemert Resort, a hotel on the Turkish riviera owned by her husband, Mehmet Ersoy.

Dollars instead of lira

The wife of Turkey's culture and tourism ministry has drawn widespread criticism after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself handing a young girl a $100 bill as the latter kisses her hand.Social media users expressed distaste for Pervin Ersoy's display of wealth amid the economic crisis engulfing the country and the government's claim to represent the working class.The photo, which was since been deleted, was taken at the five-star Maxx Royal Kemert Resort, a hotel on the Turkish riviera owned by her husband, Mehmet Ersoy. It was posted on June 4, during Bayram, which celebrates the end of Ramadan and during which young people customarily kiss the hand of an elder in exchange for a gift.Pervin Ersoy has since tried to play down the photo, saying that it was a joke and a reference to a viral video of Alişan, a well-known Turkish singer.Online users across the political spectrum also pointed out that Ersoy was flashing American dollars rather than Turkish lira.“It would be wise to remind your wife that your office represents the Party of Justice and Development, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the people"", one user tweeted at Mehmet Ersoy.

""Lack of national values, new money,” tweeted another user.

""President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he was waging a war on the dollar,"" Barıs Yarkadas, a member of the opposition Republican People’s Party, wrote on Twitter. ""I’m surprised by what you are doing.""



In August, Erdogan encouraged the public to exchange foreign currency for Turkish lira in order to show national pride and undercut Western countries' ability to hurt the economy.

28,"Africa football boss Ahmad released in France without charge, prosecutor says",News Wires,"The president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, was released without charge in France on Friday, a day after being arrested for questioning, the Marseille public prosecutor said.

ADVERTISING Read more

Prosecutor Xavier Tarabeux said Ahmad was arrested in Paris on Thursday and questioned as part of a probe into corruption, breach of trust and forgery.

Ahmad was in Paris for the FIFA Congress ahead of the start of the Women's World Cup. His confederation's marquee event, the African Cup of Nations, kicks off in Egypt on June 21.

The French investigation concerns CAF's breach, shortly after its signature in December 2017, of a contract with Puma to supply equipment and clothes to 580 volunteers at the 2018 African Nations Championship, an event for national teams made up of African players with clubs on the continent.

CAF allegedly tore up the contract in favour of a better offer from a small French-based company which supplies Adidas gear, according to documents seen by AFP.

That company is based in La Seyne-sur-Mer, on the Mediterranean coast east of Marseille, a source close to the case said.

Puma ""asked for compensation of $100,000, but CAF did not pay,"" Amr Fahmy, a former CAF Secretary General, who is already involved in a separate investigation of Ahmad, told AFP.

In a statement on Thursday, FIFA said that it had ""taken note of the alleged events concerning Mr Ahmad Ahmad, who is being questioned by the French authorities in relation to allegations related to his mandate while President of CAF.""

World football's governing body said it had asked ""the French authorities for any information"" that might be of interest to its Ethics Commission.

Ahmad is already the subject of an investigation by the commission, opened after Fahmy submitted a dossier in March alledging ""mismanagement"". Ahmad has denied the accusations.

FIFA's statement on the arrest concluded: ""FIFA is now clean from the scandals that tarnished its reputation and this same determination should prevail in governing bodies such as confederations. FIFA will be at the forefront of ensuring that this is enforced by everyone involved in football.""

44,Turkish minister's wife criticised for flaunting wealth amid economic crisis,Pervin Ersoy,"A screenshot of Pervin Ersoy's photo, which has since been deleted.

I have already explained that it was a joke, so please stop. When Alişan handed out money to his nephews, we just laughed. I clearly wrote: ""We played a joke on one of our employees.” Please stop, am I that stupid?

Dollars instead of lira

The wife of Turkey's culture and tourism ministry has drawn widespread criticism after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself handing a young girl a $100 bill as the latter kisses her hand.Social media users expressed distaste for Pervin Ersoy's display of wealth amid the economic crisis engulfing the country and the government's claim to represent the working class.The photo, which was since been deleted, was taken at the five-star Maxx Royal Kemert Resort, a hotel on the Turkish riviera owned by her husband, Mehmet Ersoy. It was posted on June 4, during Bayram, which celebrates the end of Ramadan and during which young people customarily kiss the hand of an elder in exchange for a gift.Pervin Ersoy has since tried to play down the photo, saying that it was a joke and a reference to a viral video of Alişan, a well-known Turkish singer.Online users across the political spectrum also pointed out that Ersoy was flashing American dollars rather than Turkish lira.“It would be wise to remind your wife that your office represents the Party of Justice and Development, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the people"", one user tweeted at Mehmet Ersoy.

""Lack of national values, new money,” tweeted another user.

""President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he was waging a war on the dollar,"" Barıs Yarkadas, a member of the opposition Republican People’s Party, wrote on Twitter. ""I’m surprised by what you are doing.""



In August, Erdogan encouraged the public to exchange foreign currency for Turkish lira in order to show national pride and undercut Western countries' ability to hurt the economy.



The lira fell by 30 percent in 2018 and dropped by another 10 percent in the first four months of 2019.



Erdogan's ""new money"" club

Many said the photo was evidence of the growing divide between Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) and working-class Turks.

""During its first electoral campaign in 2002, the slogan of the AKP was ‘the voice of the voiceless, the parents of orphans,'"" Paris-based journalist Guillaume Perrier wrote on Twitter.

50,Singaporeans slam Western 'begpackers' busking on subway,A Video Of A Pair Of Westerners Busking On The Subway In Singapore Quickly Drew Backlash Locals.,"A viral video of a pair of Westerners performing in the subway in Singapore has drawn backlash from locals, who called it another example of “begpackers” hoping to make small change during their visits to Asian countries.

The man and woman, dressed in matching printed tops and shorts, are seen playing a ukulele and a guitar and singing the Isley Brothers’ “Twist and Shout”. Their performance drew claps from the audience and was shared on Twitter in late May by user @heliumdaisies, who thanked the pair for “starting my day right.”

Just a normal day travelling on train and met these amazing tourist on board that brought smiles to alot faces 😍 thankyou for starting my day right 💕 pic.twitter.com/mIVAsnQxlo Caroℓ ❁ (@heliumdaisies) May 28, 2019

The video has gone viral, garnering nearly half a million views as of Thursday afternoon. But online users were less than pleased.

Many lamented the phenomenon of “begpackers,” in which wealthier Western (and often white) tourists perform or sell small items in the streets in order to fund their travels in Asian countries, where the average pay can be a fraction of what people earn in Western countries.

They always do this in ASEAN, while we have to show our bank statement for our trip. Much irony. geē (@itsmeG_A) May 29, 2019

It is unclear whether the pair are tourists, but they were seen singing and asking for donations several days earlier aboard the same East-West train, according to the local site Mothership . They claimed to use their earnings to perform across the world.The swift backlash and the fact that the video went viral underscore the resentment that many people in Southeast Asia feel toward the so-called ""begpackers."" Some online users also pointed out the irony of Westerners asking for handouts from locals, who are often required to provide bank statements when applying for tourist visas in Western countries.Others slammed the duo for busking on the train, calling the performance a nuisance and saying they preferred a quiet commute.

Buskers need a permit to perform

Busking on the train is illegal in Singapore. Those interested must pass an audition in order to receive a permit and are required to perform in the hundred or so designated locations in Singapore. In 2015, local authorities ran a pilot project that allowed musicians to perform in more than a dozen train platforms across the island.

“Begpackers” have been widely criticized for their blatant attempts to make money off of local residents when they are short on funds for the next leg of their trip or for their flight home. They’ve been seen selling postcards, strumming guitars and occasionally even swinging babies in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand as well as Singapore.

Singapore ranks among the most expensive cities in the world, but the median annual resident come is around 50,000 Singaporean dollars, or around €33,000.","A viral video of a pair of Westerners performing in the subway in Singapore has drawn backlash from locals, who called it another example of “begpackers” hoping to make small change during their visits to Asian countries.

Many lamented the phenomenon of “begpackers,” in which wealthier Western (and often white) tourists perform or sell small items in the streets in order to fund their travels in Asian countries, where the average pay can be a fraction of what people earn in Western countries.

They always do this in ASEAN, while we have to show our bank statement for our trip. Much irony. geē (@itsmeG_A) May 29, 2019

It is unclear whether the pair are tourists, but they were seen singing and asking for donations several days earlier aboard the same East-West train, according to the local site Mothership . They claimed to use their earnings to perform across the world.The swift backlash and the fact that the video went viral underscore the resentment that many people in Southeast Asia feel toward the so-called ""begpackers."" Some online users also pointed out the irony of Westerners asking for handouts from locals, who are often required to provide bank statements when applying for tourist visas in Western countries.Others slammed the duo for busking on the train, calling the performance a nuisance and saying they preferred a quiet commute.

Buskers need a permit to perform

Busking on the train is illegal in Singapore. Those interested must pass an audition in order to receive a permit and are required to perform in the hundred or so designated locations in Singapore. In 2015, local authorities ran a pilot project that allowed musicians to perform in more than a dozen train platforms across the island.

“Begpackers” have been widely criticized for their blatant attempts to make money off of local residents when they are short on funds for the next leg of their trip or for their flight home. They’ve been seen selling postcards, strumming guitars and occasionally even swinging babies in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand as well as Singapore.

Singapore ranks among the most expensive cities in the world, but the median annual resident come is around 50,000 Singaporean dollars, or around €33,000.","A viral video of a pair of Westerners performing in the subway in Singapore has drawn backlash from locals, who called it another example of “begpackers” hoping to make small change during their visits to Asian countries.

53,"'Macron, moron!': French priest goes on political rant during mass",Yellow Jacket Supporters Attended A Mass In Normandy On June,"A French priest who criticized President Emmanuel Macron during a recent mass could be taken to court for contempt and for failing to respect the separation of church and state after local authorities filed a complaint.



Francis Michel, a priest in the Planquay church in the department of Eure, in Normandy, was filmed on June 2 leading dozens of Yellow Vest supporters in a chant calling the French president a ""moron."" ""We're coming to get you,"" the crowd sang. ""Even if Macron doesn't want us, we're here to fight for workers' honor and for a better world."" The chant has been frequently taken up by protesters decrying growing inequalities in the country during the Yellow Vest movement.

Yellow Vest supporters joined in the chant calling President Emmanuel Macron a ""moron.""

The video was shared tens of thousands of times on social media and prompted a quick backlash from local officials.

""Shameful"", tweeted Sébastien Lecornu, an official in the Ministry of Territorial Cohesion and a former president of the Eure departmental council.

""Stay in your place, father,” tweeted Fabien Gouttefarde, a Eure representative from Macron’s La République en marche.

The Eure police prefecture referred the incident to the public prosecutor's office, according to the French daily newspaper Le Parisien

Michel is a well-known supporter of the Yellow Vest movement. He placed a yellow vest on a statue of a baby Jesus last year and planted crosses at a roundabout in the town of Bernay in memory of the protesters who died in the clashes.



Michel has not been recognized by the church since 2016, when he was suspended after being fined €15,000 for embezzling €100,000 in donations from the congregation, according to the TV channel LCI. He was found guilty in an appeals court.

56,Paris gallery transforms into brief haven for unaccompanied migrant minors,Around Two Dozen Unaccompanied Migrant Minors Stayed At Mains D Oeuvres,"For eleven days in late May, Mains d’Oeuvres, a cultural space in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Ouen, turned into a temporary haven for around two dozen unaccompanied migrant minors. The youths, who ranged in age from 14 to 17, helped prepare dinner, joked around with the organizers and, most importantly, had a roof over their heads.

Unaccompanied migrant minors face steep challenges in France, as their lack of papers often prevents them from being officially recognized as minors by the state and from receiving government support.

The project was inspired by a photo series by Yvan Loiseau in which he cooked meals with various families he met in nearby Saint-Ouen and which was being exhibited at Mains d’Oeuvres. After meeting Agathe Nadimi, founder of Les Midis du Mie (Lunch for foreign unaccompanied minors), which provides meals and support for migrant teenagers on their own, Loiseau decided to expand the project by inviting a group to cook and sleep in the exhibit.

The young migrants, who hailed from countries including Senegal, Somalia, Guinea and Angola, made couscous with sweet potatoes and turnips, salmon with arugula pesto and, for dessert, a strawberry salad with jasmine and basil. They set up a ping pong table and kicked a soccer ball around in the shed. As night fell, they placed thick comforters on the floor of the exhibit to use as makeshift beds.

61,Male elephant and calf wander into town in southern Guinea,Residents Of Nzérékoré,"The elephants live in the Ziama Massif, a forested mountain range nearly a hundred kilometres north of Nzérékoré. A report from 2004, the most recent available, found that 214 elephants were living the region.Wata Camara, director of the forestry centre, said elephants often wander into villages near the Ziama region, but that it was unclear how this pair ended up so far from their habitat.""We need to study this to understand what happened. We recognise this male and his calf. Three years ago, the mother was killed in the reserve by a hunter, and the two often leave the forest to look for her. That could explain why they ended up in the city. On the other hand, they could just be looking for food.

Four wildlife rangers were assigned to accompany the elephants back to the forest. Lead ranger Baré Koivogui said it was an opportunity to understand better the elephants’ behavior.

The rangers who followed the elephants for two days were equipped with GPS trackers so that we could map their route and, perhaps, learn a bit more about the motivations behind their behavior. They were also assigned to protect the elephants from potential attacks and keep onlookers from getting too close. People were surprised to see these animals that they had only seen in documentaries. As you can see in the photos, the elephants aren’t aggressive and aren’t afraid of people.

The police prefect of Nzérékoré also released a statement asking residents to treat the elephants respectfully on their journey home.","The elephants live in the Ziama Massif, a forested mountain range nearly a hundred kilometres north of Nzérékoré.

67,Moroccan villagers demand return of their land after mining pollution,Askaoun,"This land has always belonged to the residents of the village, long before there were any official registers. We reached out on several occasions to the local authorities in an attempt to get them to respect our rights and give us property titles, but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.

Parliament members from the Justice and Development Party (PJD) laid out the Askaoun residents’ concerns in a letter to the Ministry for Energy and Mines.

Askaoun residents wrote a letter to local authorities requesting property titles for land they say has historically belonged to them.

Maya Gold and Silver disputed the claims, arguing that the land in question was considered collective land that did not belong to anyone. General director Noureddine Mokadem also said the company was acting within its rights regarding the contested water source used in its mining operations.

The water we are using for silver extraction comes from Ouarzazate, near the High Atlas mountains. Local authorities diverted the water in the 1980s so that it could be used in mining operations. When the silver extraction stopped for several years, people got used to using the water to irrigate their fields and water livestock. But now that we're exploiting the mine again, we have to use the water that was brought here specifically for the mine.

The company has signed minutes from its meetings with village representatives in which residents demanded that Maya Gold and Silver provide them with access to the water and contribute to the area's development as compensation.





Meeting minutes dated June 6, 2018, signed by the Askaoun residents' association, the city of Askaoun and Maya Gold and Silver, in which local authorities agree to provide residents with property titles as quickly as possible.

Residents also say that chemical waste generated by the mining activity has had a negative impact on the environment. The Ministry of Energy and Mines said in a 2018 letter that more than half of silver mining was conducting using flotation, a process for separating materials that aims to ""reduce the environmental impact that past mining operations may have had."" The letter also stated that Maya Gold and Silver's operations had been approved in 2014.

Others said they kept their keys between their knuckles in case they needed to defend themselves.Some women also shared photos of their dogs, which they said helped ward off potential attackers.""It makes me sad that it is so common for us as women to feel the need to take extra safety measures, but ultimately I feel like discussing it is a good thing,"" Deibert told Buzzfeed News","Also, women: what do you use when you go out running?

71,Children plant trees to fight against deforestation in DR Congo,Schoolchildren In Nord Kivu With Their Seedlings That They Are Going To Plant.,"The idea is that each child adopts a tree. The project is intended for schoolchildren in particular. They plant a tree with us as soon as they start at school, and they have to look after this one tree for the whole of their schooling (12 years). They plant all sorts of different trees: acacias, coffee bushes, avocado trees and mango trees.

If everyone got involved in this project, we would have thousands of trees planted every year.

Deforestation is a big problem where I live. You just have to go out into the countryside to see trees which have been cut down or ripped out of the ground by farmers and locals. We need charcoal and wood for fuel. Even the Virunga National Park, which is supposed to be secure, has people cutting down trees. It’s a big problem. And it’s the generation after us who are going to suffer due to climate change.





“You have to get the local community involved”

I started experimenting with the idea about three years ago alongside my normal job as a radio journalist. I introduced it to around a dozen children from the local area. We planted trees and still look after them together.

Then earlier this year I started the project with schools around the Virunga National Park. We’ve started off with around 250 children aged between four and 11, around 50 children in each school, and we’ll see how that goes before we try expanding the project further. I financed it myself by buying the seedlings.

You have to get the local community involved. I explained the project to locals in the villages, and we go together with the children to tend to the trees. To persuade people to get involved, you have to first show what the problems are, the risks [of deforestation], and then how planting trees could be a solution. This was the hard part: people’s mentality. Villagers often don’t like change, and they were resistant to the project at first. Most of the villagers haven’t had an education. There’s always some suspicion, because locals find it difficult to believe in phenomena like climate change.

I thought it was important to make sure the same child looked after the same tree that they ‘adopted’ for the whole of their schooling, that way, the child already has an affection for the plant.

They have to understand that global warming is a human problem, and so it’s humans who have to solve it. I want children to learn how to save trees and not cut them down. At the same time, they enjoy it – it’s a fun activity!","They plant all sorts of different trees: acacias, coffee bushes, avocado trees and mango trees.

74,Did Iranian police really destroy thousands of bottles of alcohol?,Bottles Of Alcohol Being Destroyed In Pakistan,"A viral video posted in early May claims to show bottles of alcohol in Iran being destroyed by security forces and civilians. But that's not what actually happened.



In the video, which was shared widely on social media in Venezuela and India as well as on conservative Russian chat forums, often without sound, hundreds of what appear to be empty wine and liquor bottles are laid neatly in the dirt in front of crowd of men. The men proceed to hurl the bottles one by one into the air as others in uniform survey the scene.



The video was in fact filmed in Pakistan. Here's how we tracked it down.

Language and uniforms are a big hint

Running a reverse image search of the video quickly turns up a version with sound. The people in it are heard speaking Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. The most common languages in Iran are Persian, Kurdish and various Turkic dialects.

Additionally, one of the men in the video is wearing a white cap and uniform typical of that of a naval officer. But the uniform has short sleeves, which is inconsistent with Iranian naval uniform.

Finally, the two men holding large bottles of liquor in the foreground of the video are wearing caps that say ""Pakistan"". An online search of ""Pakistan customs"" reveals photos of Pakistani customs officials wearing hats with a similar logo.

A scene filmed by the Associated Press



The video depicts Pakistani customs officials destroying seized goods worth more than 3 billion rupees, or around €17.7 million euros on April 25.

Authorities smashed around 59,000 bottles of liquor and beer and burned narcotics outside Karachi, along Pakistan's southern coast, according to Independent News Pakistan. Drinking alcohol is forbidden for Muslims in the country.

The event can also be seen in a video and photos taken by the Associated Press.

Both the viral video and the AP video show a line of concrete blocks and an excavator to the right of the scene, as well as white plastic bags demarcating the area where the bottles are piled up.

Similar practices are also common in Iran, where producing, obtaining or consuming alcohol is illegal.

Additionally, one of the men in the video is wearing a white cap and uniform typical of that of a naval officer. But the uniform has short sleeves, which is inconsistent with Iranian naval uniform.

Finally, the two men holding large bottles of liquor in the foreground of the video are wearing caps that say ""Pakistan"". An online search of ""Pakistan customs"" reveals photos of Pakistani customs officials wearing hats with a similar logo.

A scene filmed by the Associated Press



The video depicts Pakistani customs officials destroying seized goods worth more than 3 billion rupees, or around €17.7 million euros on April 25.

Authorities smashed around 59,000 bottles of liquor and beer and burned narcotics outside Karachi, along Pakistan's southern coast, according to Independent News Pakistan. Drinking alcohol is forbidden for Muslims in the country.

The event can also be seen in a video and photos taken by the Associated Press.

Both the viral video and the AP video show a line of concrete blocks and an excavator to the right of the scene, as well as white plastic bags demarcating the area where the bottles are piled up.

76,Did Iranian police really destroy thousands of bottles of alcohol?,As Some Online Users Claimed.,"A viral video posted in early May claims to show bottles of alcohol in Iran being destroyed by security forces and civilians. But that's not what actually happened.



In the video, which was shared widely on social media in Venezuela and India as well as on conservative Russian chat forums, often without sound, hundreds of what appear to be empty wine and liquor bottles are laid neatly in the dirt in front of crowd of men. The men proceed to hurl the bottles one by one into the air as others in uniform survey the scene.



The video was in fact filmed in Pakistan. Here's how we tracked it down.

78,Eviction of refugees from Beirut building sparks xenophobic comments online,Refugees In Beirut Were Evicted Their Building On May,"Dozens of refugees in Beirut were evicted on May 22 from the building they were living in under orders from the governor, sparking a flurry of comments online about the country’s treatment of foreigners.



Evictions are common in Lebanon, but online users said that targeting the refugees, many of whom are Syrian, was racist and discriminatory.



In a video of the displaced tenants that circulated widely on social media, the man filming called out the lack of “respect” toward the refugees. “Look at what it is like for Syrians, do you see them?” the man asks in the video. “Those who want to come to Lebanon... We throw them out into the streets.”





A video of the evicted refugees in the Al-Msaytbeh neighbourhood in central Beirut.



Some online users expressed disgust at the way the refugees were being treated, while others wrote that they should “go home.”





""They should leave us alone... There are Lebanese people who really want a roof over their heads and a job,” one Facebook user commented.





""A sad scene that makes your heart go cold,” another Facebook user commented.","Evictions are common in Lebanon, but online users said that targeting the refugees, many of whom are Syrian, was racist and discriminatory.

79,Viral photo claiming to show recent Gaza attacks is actually from 2007,A Misleading Photo Was Used To Illustrate The Gaza Attacks Earlier In May.,"A photo allegedly depicting the Gaza attacks in early May was shared 40,000 times on Facebook. But it actually dates from 2007.

In the photo, a group of young men are seen running away from a missile, which appears to be just a few metres away from hitting them. Captions accompanying the photo claimed that the missile was launched into the Gaza Strip from a plane operated by Israeli forces and suggested that it was taken during the recent violent clashes between Israel and Gaza. Some online users cast doubt on the photo, saying that it had been manipulated.

A reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in May 2007 by Mahmud Hams, a photojournalist from the Agence France-Presse in Gaza. It shows young Palestinians running for cover during an Israeli airstrike that targeted a refugee camp in Gaza. The photo received the Prix Bayeux for war correspondents later that year.

Israeli and Palestinian forces reached a ceasefire on May 6. The attacks left at least 31 dead in Gaza and four in Israel.","A photo allegedly depicting the Gaza attacks in early May was shared 40,000 times on Facebook.

The protesters, many of whom are living in migrant shelters in the Paris region, called on authorities to grant migrants legal status in the country and allow them to bring their families. They also asked that Air France stop participating in deportations by flying migrants back to their home countries.



The number of deportations increased by 20 percent between 2018 and 2017, during which 14,859 people were deported, according to interior minister Christophe Castaner.



The site of the protest was symbolic, as many asylum seekers in France are flown home from Charles de Gaulle airport. Some return to their country or to their port of entry in Europe.



In videos posted on social media, protesters wearing black are seen assembling in Terminals 2F and 2G and chanting, ""Papiers pour tous,"" or ""Documents for everyone.""





Videos posted on social media showed protesters arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.





Protesters chanted ""Papiers pour tous,"" or ""Documents for everyone.""

The group ""Collectif La Chapelle debout,"" which advocates for migrants' and refugees' rights and helped organise the event with the ""black vest"" protesters, said around 500 people participated in the rally.

Police blocked off the area where the ""black vest"" protesters were gathered (Collectif La Chapelle Debout).

Protesters said they met with an Air France representative but did not reveal the nature of the discussion. They later left the airport peacefully.



The ""Collectif La Chapelle debout"" group and Air France did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

93,'Pig hands': How women in China are calling out sexual harassers in the subway,Stories Of Sexual Harassment On Public Transportation In China Have Gone Viral On Social Media Sites Like Weibo,"Women in China are increasinly taking to social media to call out the regular sexual harassment they face on public transportation.



In numerous viral videos posted on Chinese social media, women are seen confronting men who have groped them on crowded trains, at times taking advantage of the women while they are dozing off. One of the videos, posted in March on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, was viewed more than 90,000 times; another on Douyin, which is similar to Tik Tok, has been shared tens of thousands of times since May 2018. Many used the hashtag ""#咸猪手#,"" or pig hands, to describe the vulgar behavior they encountered.



One online user said in a November 2018 post on Weibo that a man sitting next to her in the subway had placed his hand on her thigh several times and then pressed up against her as he pretended to fall asleep.

One Weibo user posted in November 2018 about a man who had repeatedly touched her thigh in the subway.

Others demanded stronger support from local police, whom they say have been reluctant to intervene in incidents of sexual harassment. In a viral video posted in January, one woman confronts her alleged harasser as what appears to be members of the subway's security look on helplessly.





In this video posted in January, a woman films her alleged harasser as she denounces his ""shameless"" behavior. In her post, she urged her fellow female passengers to report incidents to the police immediately.

In an attempt to combat the rampant sexual harassment on public transportation, some cities, including Shenzhen, have set up special security teams to catch offenders.","Women in China are increasinly taking to social media to call out the regular sexual harassment they face on public transportation.

94,Men in skirts events in Taiwan go viral as government legalises same-sex marriage,Students,"Taiwan’s parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage on Friday, becoming the first in Asia to do so.

Lawmakers had a two-year window to make a decision after Taiwan’s constitutional court ruled that same-sex couples had a right to marry in 2017.

Tens of thousands of supporters waiting outside the Legislative Yuan in Taipei in the rain burst into celebration after the vote was announced.





The gay marriage bill is being voted in the Taiwanese Parliament right now! 40,000 supporters have showed up in the rally to support the bill! ????️‍???? #MarriageEquality #Taiwan #釋字748 pic.twitter.com/5DLwn6tJJz Glenn Lio (@GlennLio) May 17, 2019



“#LoveWon,” President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted. “We took a big step towards true equality, and made Taiwan a better country.”

The weeks leading up to the vote were marked in part by student-led “men in skirts” events that went viral. At New Taipei Banqiao High School, students organised a week-long event in early May encouraging male classmates to wear skirts to support gender equality and challenge societal norms of what men and women should wear.

Teachers at the school joined in as well. In a video posted to the New Taipei Banqiao High School student union Facebook page, principal Lai Chunjin said the event aimed to “smash gender stereotypes.”







Photos of the campaign went viral on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, with supporters commending the students for their work and writing that people were free to wear what they liked.

The success of the event drew the attention of students at National Taiwan University, who launched their own “Men in Skirts” day on May 13.","Taiwan’s parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage on Friday, becoming the first in Asia to do so.
