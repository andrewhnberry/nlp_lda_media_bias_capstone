0,"Millennials ‘Make Farming Sexy’ in Africa, Where Tilling the Soil Once Meant Shame",Sarah Maslin Nir,"In cuff links and tie, seated in his mansion in Accra, Richard Nunekpeku, 34, wants to project what this new breed of agripreneur can achieve. Five years ago, he left a high-paying job as an international marketing manager for Samsung to raise fowl, cereals and vegetables through a cooperative, Anyako Farms.

It hasn’t been easy. His first year, he invested nearly $80,000 in planting maize — but without irrigation, a dry spell wiped out the crop. The harvest earned just $8,000.

Drawing on his corporate background, Mr. Nunekpeku started over, hiring researchers in soils and fertilizer, and investing in high-tech irrigation. This year his farm is on track to break even for the first time, he said.

A boom in technology that aims to increase productivity is helping make agriculture more modern and lucrative. The number of agricultural technology start-ups in Africa has grown significantly from 2016 to 2018, according to a report by Disrupt Africa, a technology news site.

For some young farmers, it is not enough just to lure their peers into the sector. Nana Adjoa A. Sifa, 31, who has a degree in psychology, wants to utterly change how farming is done.

After years of working to engage youth and women in farming, she became a farmer herself. And she uses no pesticides on her farm, Guzakuza, planting mutually beneficial vegetables on a single plot.

“I want to transform mind-sets, and Africa,” Ms. Sifa said, holding an organic carrot seedling. “If we fail, it means the industry has failed. It means we have failed many young people.”","In cuff links and tie, seated in his mansion in Accra, Richard Nunekpeku, 34, wants to project what this new breed of agripreneur can achieve.

1,What young Zambians have to say about making farming more attractive,Thomas Daum,"Africa has the youngest population of any continent – 60% are under age 25. While this has evoked both hope and fear, it is clear that jobs are needed for the 12 million people entering the workforce every year.

Agriculture is best suited to provide a great many jobs as it can absorb much labour, and because prospering farms trigger employment opportunities in the rest of the economy. But agriculture is often unattractive for the youth.

To lure young people into farming, policymakers and development actors emphasise the need for modern technology, including agricultural mechanisation. But surprisingly little is known about the opinion of young people in rural areas. Few have asked them what farming and rural areas need to look like to be more attractive.

I conducted a study in Zambia and asked people in rural areas aged between 12 and 20 what would make farming attractive for them. I used two research methods to explore their aspirations and perceptions: interviews as well as drawing exercises.

The results show that young people find more positive aspects in agriculture than often assumed and that the attractiveness of farming doesn’t only hinge on modern technologies. While some technologies are needed, having diverse and sustainable farms, a healthy environment and an attractive rural life is equally important.

Provided by author

The findings

Most of the people interviewed for the study were proud of the fact that they came from farming families that owned land and worked close to the nature. Ruth (15) expanded on this and said:

We do not pay for maize, land, water and fruits such as mangoes. We have nutritious food.

The respondents also commented on the attractiveness of the rural space. Asked where they want to live in the future, rural or urban, 53% preferred rural areas, because of their freedom and social networks.

In contrast, urban life was often perceived as bad, characterised by road accidents, pollution, Satanism, thieves and drunkards. According to Talunsa (15) people are “poisoned by alcohol and fight”.

Many also found farming unattractive, citing drudgery and weather dependence as reasons. They said they would rather aim for jobs with a regular salary such as teachers. Lozi (16) said:

I want to work with the government. Then I’ll get paid monthly.

Around half of the respondents preferred a future in urban areas rather than in rural areas. These respondents were “pulled” away from rural areas because they were attracted by the perceived positive sides of urban areas. But they were also “pushed” away from rural areas which they associate with a lot of challenges. These included the high labour burden and risks associated with farming. This is what some of the respondents said about these “push” factors:

In the village, we always eat the same, beans and nshima, and we need to work hard.“ (Elina, 16) In the village, you can be bewitched over small disputes and the fields are very small. I prefer to live in town.” (Jakob, 15).

It’s important to note that the decision to reside either in a rural or urban area was rarely perceived as a lifetime decision. Respondents highlighted that one could work in town after harvest or for some years after school to save some money before returning to the village.

Some of my friends want to go to town but others want to stay. Of the ones who went, many came back after some years. (Alik, 14) I want to raise some money in town but then I want to move back to my village. I will bring a tractor with me and cultivate a lot of land. (Raimond, 17)

Making farming attractive

So what does farming need to look like to be attractive?

The young people provided some direction on what they thought would make rural spaces more attractive.

The most important factors were:

Modern technologies such as tractors and digital tools. But these shouldn’t be over emphasised. Low-tech solutions shouldn’t be neglected.

Non-material factors. Making agriculture attractive requires de-risking agriculture and promoting sustainable and diverse farms. These were clearly depicted in the drawings I’d asked the respondents to sketch of their ideal farm. The drawings typically showed highly diverse farms with trees, vegetables, fruits and animals.

Ensure healthy landscapes. Having a sustainable, pollution free environment was commonly mentioned as a key advantage of rural over urban life.

Rural areas must be developed in ways that go beyond just infrastructure. Social life and networks, which are still an asset in villages compared to cities, were also cited as important. This included networks of neighbours, relatives and friend and the communal celebration of traditions.

What next

Policymakers often highlight the need for modern technologies – including information, communication and technology – when discussing rural development.

But the young respondents I spoke to emphasised more low-tech solutions such as increasing farm diversity, having water wells and using draught animals, which is already an advantage over manual labour.

This suggests that policymakers and development practitioners need to pay more attention to the actual aspirations of young people in rural areas to avoid well-intended but misguided policies. In addition, the findings suggest that there is a need for several policies to reflect several types of young people in rural areas.","But surprisingly little is known about the opinion of young people in rural areas.

2,Ugandan firm uses blockchain to trace coffee from farms to stores,Elias Biryabarema,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - An Ugandan company has started using blockchain, the technology behind virtual currency Bitcoin, to certify shipments of coffee to try to meet growing demand from consumers for more information about where products have come from.

FILE PHOTO: A worker displays washed and fermented coffee beans as they dry on coffee beds at the Tilamo cooperative of Shebedino district in Sidama, Ethiopia November 29, 2018.. REUTERS/Maheder Haileselassie/File Photo

Carico Café Connoisseur said the move could help to boost farmers’ incomes, as consumers are usually prepared to pay more for goods that can been traced back to their origins.

Blockchain works by providing a shared record of data held by a network of individual computers rather than a single party. Its supporters say this makes it hard to tamper with, and so a secure way to track goods along the supply chain

Carico Café Connoisseur CEO Mwambu Wanendeya told Reuters a blockchain-certified shipment of one of its coffee products, Bugisu Blue, arrived in South Africa last month. He declined to give the size of the shipment, but said it was several tonnes.

Uganda is Africa’s largest coffee exporter followed by Ethiopia, according to the International Coffee Organisation, and has some of the world’s highest quality beans. It predominantly cultivates the robusta variety, but also has extensive fields of arabica trees.

Limited domestic processing capacity means the country exports nearly all of its beans in raw form.

The blockchain certification means consumers can trace the coffee’s journey by using their smartphones to scan the product’s QR codes or via the certification site provenance.org.

Every step of the beans’ journey - from when farmers drop them off at collection centers to warehousing, inspection by regulators and shipping - is recorded.

“The idea is to give the consumer an appreciation of what happens on the journey and also to ensure that there’s more linkages with the farmer,” Wanendeya said.

“Traceability is important because people are increasingly concerned that ... farmers get rewarded for their work.”

The process will provide consumers with information such as the type of coffee bean, the year it was harvested, and where it was grown.

Founded in 2016, Carico Café is working with two farmer cooperatives with hundreds of members. Wanendeya predicted the innovation could boost farmers’ incomes by 10 percent.

“Consumers are willing to pay more if they can know where exactly the coffee is coming from,” he said.

Uganda is keen to increase coffee exports from the current level of around 4 million 60-kilogramme bags per year.

However, a seedlings distribution program it hoped would boost production has yielded modest results, in part because of a decline in interest in coffee among farmers due to often low and unstable prices.","Blockchain works by providing a shared record of data held by a network of individual computers rather than a single party.

4,Qatar: Beyond the Blockade,Ghanem Al Sulaiti,"A look at the effect of the GCC crisis and how it's affecting life in Qatar - from family ties, to business, to art.

On June 5th, 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt imposed a blockade on Qatar - closing their land, air and sea borders with it - accusing it of funding ""terrorism"" and fomenting regional instability.

The Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini governments told their citizens to return from Qatar. They also asked Qatari citizens who were visiting, studying or living in their respective countries, to leave for Qatar within 14 days.

This diplomatic move left Qatar partially isolated - economically, politically and culturally.

""We saw the news and thought it's just a political thing and it will be over in a while. Everything will be back to normal,"" recalls Mohammad Awais Shafeeq, a businessman of Pakistani descent, born and raised in Qatar.

As this crisis continues without a solution, this film follows several people in Qatar to find out how they are facing up to life under blockade.

Lulwa al-Obaidli is a Qatari entrepreneur who has founded a number of different businesses.

Her potato-based snack business has suffered from the blockade, forcing her to downsize and look for new sources of potatoes and the customised flavourings. She has also felt the effect of the blockade on a personal level, with her siblings in the UAE seldom even communicating with her.

""It's killing me that my brother is getting married and I can't be there ... Do you know how painful it is when you can't even contact your own family?"" says Lulwa. ""I remember during Eid celebrations, [my brother] Abdulrahman only sent a text saying 'Eid Mubarak'. Not even a phone call.""

Countries grow in crises, people grow in crises and we grew. Qatar has become stronger, Qatar has become more united. Ghanem Al Sulaiti, Qatari actor and playwright

Meanwhile, Alanood Al-Jalahma, a university student in Qatar, worries she will have to leave the country she calls home. Born to a Bahraini father and a Qatari mother, she has lived in Qatar ever since her parents' divorce when she was four years old.

Alanood, however, only has her father's Bahraini citizenship. In all the GCC countries, citizenship is passed from father to child, so Alanood and her siblings are facing a dilemma: to leave their mother, university and home or potentially lose their only citizenship.

""All our memories, all our friends, all our family [are in Qatar],"" says Alanood. ""So to be forced to leave would be awful.""

Stories like these have inspired famous Qatari actor Ghanem al-Sulaiti to come out of a years' long hiatus to write a series of satirical sketches mocking the absurdity of the blockade.

""What's Happening?"" started as a series of sketches on YouTube and quickly became popular, gaining over two million hits - half of which are tracked to have come from audiences in the blockading countries.

He sees his political satire as a way to allow people to both laugh and lament at the Gulf diplomatic crisis. The film follows al-Sulaiti as he prepares for his recent play for a run at Qatar National Theatre on the same subject.

""My goals are simple. I want to restore our balance. To mock and laugh at what happened and to mourn what happened. But my biggest goal is to document this for future generations,"" al-Sulaiti says.

5,The Trump Show,Dan Mcadams,"A look at the blurred lines between Donald Trump, reality TV star and Donald Trump, President of the United States.

From his long, unwieldy press conferences to the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice in prime time, Donald Trump delivers on spectacle.

He's an authentic fake, I think he really is. He has taken the role on so much that Donald Trump is always playing Donald Trump. Dan McAdams, psychology professor, Northwestern University

There is conflict, there is humiliation, and there is supreme confidence - dramatic elements pulled straight out of a reality TV playbook that for Trump has been years in the making. The Apprentice, a show fronted and co-produced by Donald Trump, established him as a gospel of success, despite being plagued by bankruptcy and scandal.

Building on this image, and through similar projects, Trump has arguably become a brand unto himself, endearing himself to a segment of the American public that supported him all the way to the White House.

Now in the early days of his presidency, the showmanship continues, as 24-hour news channels race to cover his every move. Is Donald Trump in his own reality show? And what does it mean for the United States?

Josh Rushing explores Trump's reality TV rise from a C-list New York celebrity to the most powerful office in the world.

6,Brazil's River of Mud,Juliana Ruhfus,"We investigate the events leading up to the Fundao dam disaster. Is enough being done to avoid future recurrences?

Editor's note: On January 25, 2019, another mine tailings dam burst in the same state of Minas Gerais – this time near the town of Brumadinho. At least 166 people were killed. Almost 200 more are still missing. It had been constructed in the same way as the Fundao dam. On February 15, prosecutors said they had arrested eight employees of Brazilian mining company Vale SA as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.

Last November, the Fundao mining dam in Southeastern Brazil burst, unleashing a 50 million cubic metre tsunami of mud and mining waste which flowed across the region.

Nineteen people died, 6,000 were displaced and entire towns were destroyed. It was the country's worst ever environmental disaster.

Eight months later, we travelled to the state of Minas Gerais, the centre of Brazil's mining industry, to investigate events leading up to the disaster and examine worrying claims that local government is not doing enough to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring again.

FILMMAKER'S VIEW

By Leila Lak

I first visited the area affected by the Fundao disaster three weeks after the dam burst. I filmed devastated local fishing communities as well as residents of the town of Bento Rodriguez, then completely submerged in mud, who had fled their homes.

Their loss was so palpable and their story so in need of telling that I contacted Al Jazeera reporter Juliana Ruhfus and together we began work on an investigation into events leading up to the disaster. We were soon confronted by worrying claims that not enough was being done by local government to prevent a similar tragedy in the future, allegedly because of the huge influence mining companies have over both politicians and the economy in Minas Gerais. The results of our investigation would reveal that, in many ways, Fundao represents a microcosm of Brazil's current political woes; a disaster borne from the influence of large companies over government and a lack of transparency in how both business and politics are conducted.

Our first discovery was that the company operating Fundao, Samarco, is co-owned by mining giant Vale, the fifth largest campaign donor to Brazilian politicians. This wasn't illegal under Brazilian law, until last year when the Supreme Court banned future corporate donations to politicians and political parties, but it made us question what mining companies had been receiving in return for their generosity.

The industry is the principal source of employment for much of the state of Minas Gerais and both industry insiders and many local politicians argue that development and jobs must come before concerns about the environment. These views shed some light on how it was possible for Samarco to gain a licence in the first place, allowing the company to build and begin operating the Fundao dam in 2007, without even submitting an evacuation plan for local residents in case of a dam burst.

This licence was renewed in 2014, again without an evacuation plan in place. Since the accident, Samarco operations have been forced to cease until the damage is cleaned up, but many politicians in the state have been lobbying to allow the company to reopen its sites immediately, claiming job losses are devastating the regional economy.

In response to mounting public pressure, legislators have put together an Extraordinary Commission on Dams, responsible for writing a report about the disaster and using the lessons learned as the basis for a series of new laws aimed at improving safeguards. But as we discovered, more than half of the legislators appointed to the commission had either received substantial campaign donations from mining companies or were facing corruption charges for their previous actions in office, all of which appeared to call their impartiality and suitability into question.

We also obtained copies of reports from the police investigation into the dam break. They revealed that the structure was built from cheap substandard materials and that the company had ignored warnings from one of its own engineers about the risk of a breach.

At present the Minas Gerais state mining authority, which is responsible for conducting dam inspections, only has four employees to cover 400 mining dams. As each dam takes 10 months to assess, it’s easy to see the deep flaws in this system of government oversight. And of those dams that have been inspected, many more are categorized as unsafe.

Yet mining companies are allowed to continue operating with little or no apparent intervention from the government and despite the considerable risks to nearby communities; communities like the town of Bento Rodrigues which was completely destroyed by the Fundao dam collapse.

There we met survivor Marinalva Salgado and her family. They told us they had heard rumours that the dam was unsafe but had never expected it to collapse in such a dramatic way. And when it did, they never imagined they would be left alone to run for their lives.

No siren sounded and no one came to their aid, Marinalva said. Her family has since been put up in rented accommodation, paid for by Samarco, in the nearby city of Mariana. But they long to return to their small community and rural way of life. Marinalva is deeply concerned that if the laws and the way they are implemented aren't changed more communities will be affected and perhaps next time the death toll will be higher and the devastation even greater.

7,Is a military solution the only option left in Libya?,Guma El-Gamaty,"War has been raging on in Libya for more than two months. What was supposed to be a quick operation for renegade general Khalifa Haftar's forces to take over the Libyan capital Tripoli has now turned into a battle of attrition.

Over 600 people have been killed, more than 3,000 injured and some 90,000 displaced from their homes. Thousands of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed due to the indiscriminate shelling. Nearly three million people remain besieged in the capital, forced to spend the holy month of Ramadan in fear and shortages of basic goods.

So far there has been no clear winner. Factions aligned with the Government of National Accord (GNA) have managed to stop the advance of Haftar's forces and killed his hopes for a quick victory in Tripoli.

The United Nations has issued a number of statements calling on the two sides to halt hostilities, but they have all fallen on deaf ears. Neither the GNA, nor Haftar are willing to back down or agree to a ceasefire. The UN Security Council has also been unable to reach consensus on any resolution that would end the fighting and restart the negations process.

This is because the international community remains divided on Libya, with regional and world powers backing each of the two sides and further fuelling the conflict.

Is a political solution still possible?

Over the past four years, the UN has put a lot of effort in trying to bring the ongoing civil war in Libya to a peaceful resolution. Even as Haftar moved his forces towards Tripoli, UN representatives still insisted that a political solution must be pursued.

Haftar's forces launched their offensive just days before the National Conference was scheduled to be held the Libyan city of Ghadames.

As a result of the attack, the conference, which had been in the making for months, was cancelled and the UN mediation efforts severely undermined. Now two months later, it seems quite clear that the peace process the UN had worked so hard to kick-start is dead.

Meanwhile, positions on both sides of the war have hardened significantly. Fayez Serraj, head of the GNA, has gone as far as saying that he had been ""stabbed in the back"" and that it was a mistake to have trusted Haftar's intentions in all the meetings he had with him previously. He now insists that the renegade general can no longer be a partner in any peace talks.

Haftar, on the other hand, is also adamant in his stance and says that he is not ready to commit to any ceasefire or political process, whether backed by the UN or any other political actor. He seems bound on continuing his assault on Tripoli. ""Of course, the political solution is still the goal. But to get back to politics, we must first finish with militias,"" he told a French newspaper late last month.

By now, it appears that a political solution to the conflict is very much unlikely. The only way the fighting can come to an end is if one of the sides achieves a conclusive military victory.

What does a military solution mean?

It is not only the two sides to the conflict which seem to be betting on a military solution. Various regional and international players are intervening in Libya with the hope of securing a victory for the side they favour.

Fresh deliveries of advanced weapons and ammunition have been made to both camps, which in effect is only prolonging the war. Despite the fact that the supply of arms is in clear violation of the UN arms embargo, there has been little public condemnation of these actions.

There are two possible outcomes of the ongoing war: Either Haftar would eventually succeed in taking over Tripoli and removing the GNA from power or the GNA would be able to push his forces out of the capital and launch a counteroffensive.

In the first case, Libya would be doomed to a one-man military rule. If Haftar takes the capital, he would effectively have control over Libya's three most important strategic assets: the political centre of the country, its key institutions, and most of its oil. These would help him solidify his grip on power and impose a Gaddafi-style regime backed by the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

In the second case, the country would still have a chance to pursue a political solution. If the forces loyal to the GNA manage to overrun Haftar's positions in the west and south, this would significantly weaken him, both politically and militarily. A defeat would most likely mean his exclusion from any future political dialogue. Given that he has been one of the biggest obstacles to achieving permanent peace and stability in Libya, his elimination as a political factor would bode well for the future of the country.

The problem with ""waiting"" for a military solution to the conflict in Libya is that it will cost the country and its civilian population dearly. As UN special envoy Ghassan Salame pointed out recently, the fighting around Tripoli is ""just the start of a long and bloody war"".

The death and suffering of Libyan civilians is very much preventable, if only the international community would find the political will to act.

Haftar's forces launched their offensive just days before the National Conference was scheduled to be held the Libyan city of Ghadames.

As a result of the attack, the conference, which had been in the making for months, was cancelled and the UN mediation efforts severely undermined. Now two months later, it seems quite clear that the peace process the UN had worked so hard to kick-start is dead.

Meanwhile, positions on both sides of the war have hardened significantly. Fayez Serraj, head of the GNA, has gone as far as saying that he had been ""stabbed in the back"" and that it was a mistake to have trusted Haftar's intentions in all the meetings he had with him previously. He now insists that the renegade general can no longer be a partner in any peace talks.

Haftar, on the other hand, is also adamant in his stance and says that he is not ready to commit to any ceasefire or political process, whether backed by the UN or any other political actor. He seems bound on continuing his assault on Tripoli. ""Of course, the political solution is still the goal. But to get back to politics, we must first finish with militias,"" he told a French newspaper late last month.

By now, it appears that a political solution to the conflict is very much unlikely. The only way the fighting can come to an end is if one of the sides achieves a conclusive military victory.

What does a military solution mean?

It is not only the two sides to the conflict which seem to be betting on a military solution. Various regional and international players are intervening in Libya with the hope of securing a victory for the side they favour.

Fresh deliveries of advanced weapons and ammunition have been made to both camps, which in effect is only prolonging the war. Despite the fact that the supply of arms is in clear violation of the UN arms embargo, there has been little public condemnation of these actions.

There are two possible outcomes of the ongoing war: Either Haftar would eventually succeed in taking over Tripoli and removing the GNA from power or the GNA would be able to push his forces out of the capital and launch a counteroffensive.

In the first case, Libya would be doomed to a one-man military rule. If Haftar takes the capital, he would effectively have control over Libya's three most important strategic assets: the political centre of the country, its key institutions, and most of its oil. These would help him solidify his grip on power and impose a Gaddafi-style regime backed by the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

In the second case, the country would still have a chance to pursue a political solution. If the forces loyal to the GNA manage to overrun Haftar's positions in the west and south, this would significantly weaken him, both politically and militarily. A defeat would most likely mean his exclusion from any future political dialogue. Given that he has been one of the biggest obstacles to achieving permanent peace and stability in Libya, his elimination as a political factor would bode well for the future of the country.

The problem with ""waiting"" for a military solution to the conflict in Libya is that it will cost the country and its civilian population dearly. As UN special envoy Ghassan Salame pointed out recently, the fighting around Tripoli is ""just the start of a long and bloody war"".

The death and suffering of Libyan civilians is very much preventable, if only the international community would find the political will to act.

9,Is a military solution the only option left in Libya?,Guma El-Gamaty Is A Libyan Academic,"War has been raging on in Libya for more than two months. What was supposed to be a quick operation for renegade general Khalifa Haftar's forces to take over the Libyan capital Tripoli has now turned into a battle of attrition.

Over 600 people have been killed, more than 3,000 injured and some 90,000 displaced from their homes. Thousands of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed due to the indiscriminate shelling. Nearly three million people remain besieged in the capital, forced to spend the holy month of Ramadan in fear and shortages of basic goods.

So far there has been no clear winner. Factions aligned with the Government of National Accord (GNA) have managed to stop the advance of Haftar's forces and killed his hopes for a quick victory in Tripoli.

The United Nations has issued a number of statements calling on the two sides to halt hostilities, but they have all fallen on deaf ears. Neither the GNA, nor Haftar are willing to back down or agree to a ceasefire. The UN Security Council has also been unable to reach consensus on any resolution that would end the fighting and restart the negations process.

This is because the international community remains divided on Libya, with regional and world powers backing each of the two sides and further fuelling the conflict.

10,"Why a hipster, vegan, green tech economy is not sustainable",Vijay Kolinjivadi,"On the western borderlands of Montreal's well-to-do Outremont district and the ultra-hipsterised and gentrified Mile End lies an expanse of land where the University of Montreal is currently building a new science campus. Just across is Parc-Extension, one of Canada's poorest and most densely populated neighbourhoods and a port of call for many newly arrived immigrants.

The new campus has been touted as a model of ""sustainable development"". It boasts LEED-certified buildings to reduce environmental impact, rainwater collection structures, energy-efficient lighting and heat recycling, infrastructure for electric vehicles and bikes, lots of greenery, and overall, a minimal carbon footprint. A number of tech companies, including Microsoft's new AI Hub, are moving in and are expected to further enhance the ""eco-efficiency"" of the area.

The unspoken expectation is that once the green new campus is completed, capital and economic growth will naturally flow into the area. This means nearby neighbourhoods will get ""revitalised"", especially the poorer ones, like Parc-Extension.

Thus, immigrant-owned grocery stores, halal butcheries and community centres will soon be replaced by vegan chain restaurants, hip vintage clothing joints, organic food stores and coffee-shops galore, as landlords push out poor tenants to make space for more well-to-do ones.

In the process, the implicit socio-economic violence behind gentrification will be invariably ""greenwashed"" and presented as development that would make the area more ""sustainable"", ""beautiful"" and ""modern"".

Unfortunately, creation by destruction is what capitalism does best, and its damaging practices are anything but green. This market-driven ""sustainable"" vision of economic activity, ecological-conscious diets and ""hipness"" within modern capitalism reinforce inequality and still hurt the environment.

Before I proceed further with my argument, I should mention that I am an academic, living in a ""hip"" part of Montreal and engage in activities that follow a particular aesthetic ethos, all of which make me very much a part of the reality I critique below. My aim is not to moralise, but rather to highlight the dangers of a political and economic system that profits from deceiving perhaps well-meaning self-proclaimed progressive folks into believing that a greener, more efficient capitalism is possible.

The illusion of 'sustainable development'

The term ""sustainable development"" was first introduced at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. At that time, Western governments espousing neoliberalism had just spent the whole previous decade dismantling unions, environmental regulations, and Keynesian welfare programmes and were looking to spread their practices elsewhere, as major geopolitical threats to a fully global and universal capitalist development trajectory were beginning to wane.

At the backdrop of these developments, concerns over environmental degradation and social inequality were coming to the fore and something had to be done about them.

The ""solution"" was to have one's cake and eat it too… that is, to paradoxically turn ""social"" and ""green"" values into new markets for expanding capital.

""Sustainable development"" not only proposed that negative social and environmental impacts were mere ""externalities"" to the system that could be diminished through profit-oriented market-based mechanisms but also implied that there is no escaping a neoliberal development model.

Thus, environmental problems became framed as an issue of inefficiency that could be solved by technology and the better management of resources, which effectively neutralised the politically-oriented environmentalism of the 1960s and 1970s.

An elite cadre of policy experts, economists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs took over the environmental issue and transformed it into another profit-making endeavour, presenting the expansion of capital as progress towards a more ""sustainable"" future.

In essence, environmentalism was and is consciously de-politicised for the purposes of expanding profit.

Part of the conceit surrounding apolitical techno-focused environmentalism centres on the idea of dematerialising economic growth through more efficient lifestyles and technologies. These include using the latest labour-saving apps on your phone, purchasing energy-saving appliances, eating vegan or organic food, and constructing buildings with lower negative environmental impact.

While these improvements in efficiency should indeed be applauded, they are not a solution to the major environmental problems we face today. This is because such ""quick fixes"" derive from the economic and political structures of capital expansion.

Growth-based economies are at the heart of environmental disasters we face today; making our goods, economic activity or infrastructure ""greener"" and more efficient without a major overhaul of the global economic system is not a long-term solution.

Improving efficiency would always involve maintaining and indeed expanding production to satisfy growing demand. This is reflected in the so-called ""Jevons paradox"", named after the 19th-century English economist William Stanley Jevons, who discovered that increasing energy efficiency also led to higher demand.

Today this ""rebound effect"" can be observed across economic sectors, as gains made due to enhanced efficiency are put back into use to fuel further growth. The higher efficiency of planes, cars and electronic devices is immediately offset by cheaper prices, resulting in an increase in demand and ultimately greater consumption of energy and resources. And within the globalised economic system we live in, the enhanced efficiency in one place often happens at the expense of growing inefficiency or waste in others.

In other words, the more efficient we are, the cheaper consumption gets, and in an economy predicated on endless growth, the more we consume and waste. The environment will always be at the losing endof this logic.

Working 'green'

When capitalism teams up with growth-oriented efficiency improvements, one result is the fabulous hipsterised ""green tech"" enclaves we see emerging in cities around the world, including Montreal.

These high-tech enterprises, along with the professions of the ""creative class"" (eg artists, musicians, academics, graphic designers etc), often concentrate in places where heavy industry and manufacturing have been shifted elsewhere in the same country or abroad. Rather than producing raw materials or manufactured goods, they focus on expert information provision.

Those who argue that growth can be accompanied by a dematerialising economic activity are convinced that these knowledge and creative classes of the service economy have somehow lower environmental impacts than those engaged in industrial agriculture or manufacturing (so-called ""dirty"" jobs). But is this information economy really any cleaner and greener?

Not really. This is because the resources they need to operate fundamentally depend on manufacturing and intensive agriculture located increasingly further away from their sites of operation, and often carry with them significant environmental impacts and exploitative labour practices.

Let us take the information economy's dependence on technology as an example. In their work, the creative classes both use and rely on the mass consumption of certain technological products, whose raw materials are extracted in war-torn places like the Democratic Republic of Congo and later assembled in places like China, where workers face precarious working conditions and inadequate pay.

High-tech devices may be advertised as extremely efficient, but the remarkably fast growth of the communications industry has not only increased the demand for material resources, boosting dangerous extractive industries in developing countries but also drastically expanded energy consumption. By 2020, IT would use as much as 20 percent of electricity globally, contributing significantly to carbon emissions.

This industry is also producing an ever-expanding amount of e-waste - currently the fastest-growing solid waste stream - which is shipped en masse to developing countries where it is polluting the environment and killing workers that recycle it.

Green tech enclaves may appear to be materially light compared to manufacturing, industrial agriculture, or mineral extraction only because they rely on goods produced elsewhere, usually beyond national borders. But exporting ""dirty production"" abroad and keeping national records ""cleaner"" does not make the service industry any greener.

Indeed, the fact that Montreal is not buried in heaps of e-waste has little to do with the ""green-ness"" of the city and much more to do with the Canadian government's pernicious practiceof shipping refuse abroad.

Eating 'green'

In recent years, veganism has also been sucked into the profit-making ""green"" economy. Its rising popularity is indeed quite mind-boggling. What was traditionally seen as a subversive and anti-establishment form of resistance to the global food industry and its horrific abuse of animals has increasingly become a ""cash cow"".

The reason why veganism has gone so mainstream is because of how it has been presented - as a ""win-win"" strategy. It's good for your health, it's good for the planet, and it's good for the animals! What's not to love about it? Indeed, there's nothing not to love about veganism per se.

But going vegan within a growth-based economy does not save you from the ""rebound effect"".

According to Oxford researcher Marco Springmann, if the world were to turn vegan by 2050, it would save $1.5 trillion in health-care costs and climate change damages, as it would cut greenhouse emissions by two thirds.

But in a capitalist economy, such a surplus would never simply be left idle. It would be re-invested into further growth, which would still consume more resources, exploit workers and produce waste and damage the environment in one way or the other.

A growing demand for vegan products would also be devastating for biodiversity because it would rely on monoculture fruit and vegetable crops (particularly soybeans). It would also necessitate expanding arable land by cutting down forests and increase the consumption of water for agriculture. It would also deepen already existing labour exploitation of vulnerable populations and further encourage large landowners and corporations to abuse small-scale farmers.

The dairy-free products in the health food stores in Montreal's hip Plateau and Mile End districts are often tagged ""cruelty-free"", but they may not actually be. If no animals were abused in the making, that does not mean that humans and/or the environment weren't.

The cashews for that delicious non-dairy milk you buy likely come from India, where women work long hours in poor conditions to shell the nuts, enduring painful injuries from the acid released in the process. The almonds for the equally delicious almond option are likely sourced from drought-stricken California, where almond farming is one of the largest consumers of water.

Indeed, growth-oriented capitalism will ""sell"" you veganism as a noble practice that reflects your values and benefits your health, but it would not tell you the full story about the ongoing and long-term social and ecological consequences of industrial veganism.

Being 'cool'

Working and eating ""green"" is, of course, accompanied by a certain lifestyle shaped by hipsterised aesthetics of ""coolness"" - be they vintage furniture, organic markets, tattoo parlours, or third wave coffee shops. But being ""green"" and ""cool"" often has a steep price-tag which directly reinforces classist divisions in society.

For this reason, the production of ""coolness"" in its myriad forms is a slippery slope and requires much deeper collective reflection on its consequences.

In theory, ""coolness"" just is. It is imbued with all the things that reflect deep relational values of care, affection, creativity, connection, authenticity, and meaning. It should have no racial, gendered or socio-economic boundaries and likewise, have no impact on those fronts either.

In practice, it involves the reproduction of a particular way of being which invariably sets in motion new avenues for capital to expand, allowing everything that has meaning to be hollowed-out and commodified for profit.

Returning to the example of the University of Montreal's new campus, the juxtaposition of the campus to Parc-Extension, as one of Canada's poorest and most culturally-diverse neighbourhoods, renders obvious the classist and racialised ways by which the emergence of ""coolness"" takes place.

Just who can extend particular aesthetics of hipness, eco-friendly chic and health-conscious consumption patterns is tightly associated with both class and inherited privilege to consume and waste more.

At the same time, it is these historically privileged individuals at the forefront of ""coolness"" that consciously or unconsciously accept the modern conceit of equating human progress with new forms of value to exploit for profit. In doing so, the violent ecological destruction and social displacement of the ensemble of humans and non-humans around the world which work to serve the forever unsatisfied aesthetics of the ""cool"" class become the unfortunate consequence.

What's potentially more problematic with the classist nature of green production and consumption is that urban hipsters pride themselves as being ""woke"" about sustainability issues, while simultaneously alienating the rural and overseas agricultural, peri-urban, and manufacturing classes, without whom ""hip"" lifestyles would not be possible.

Urban hipsters are quick to dismiss poorer classes as having no ""green consciousness"", for not living up to their expensive ""green"" standards, and failing to recognise the fact that opportunities to live ""green"" are limited in places that are economically disadvantaged and neglected by the authorities. They also tend to turn their backs on working-class political struggles for the fairer distribution of wealth and well-being across society.

On a global scale, capitalism is most certainly not ""cool""… it is literally burning our planet. An aloof, detached, apolitical coolness which centres on individuality and imagery is simply not going to cut it any more.

Such lifestyles may appear marginally efficient, but they are, by and large, a convenient by-product of shifting social and ecological costs to those less privileged both locally and globally.

One way to move forward in a positive direction is to abandon a singular focus on lifestyle choice to focus resistance on externally-conceived and profit-driven developments as a moral and even survivalist imperative and work to re-establish community through solidarity economies, replenishing those relations severed by the growth-centred logic.

Material or energy dematerialisation is simply not enough. It must be accompanied by an economy built on care and responsibility, rather than profit, growth and self-interest if it is to have any long-term impact. This is a small but absolutely crucial step towards attaining the authentic desires for sustainability that many of us are so dearly committed to and which we so urgently need.

Being 'cool'

Working and eating ""green"" is, of course, accompanied by a certain lifestyle shaped by hipsterised aesthetics of ""coolness"" - be they vintage furniture, organic markets, tattoo parlours, or third wave coffee shops. But being ""green"" and ""cool"" often has a steep price-tag which directly reinforces classist divisions in society.

For this reason, the production of ""coolness"" in its myriad forms is a slippery slope and requires much deeper collective reflection on its consequences.

In theory, ""coolness"" just is. It is imbued with all the things that reflect deep relational values of care, affection, creativity, connection, authenticity, and meaning. It should have no racial, gendered or socio-economic boundaries and likewise, have no impact on those fronts either.

In practice, it involves the reproduction of a particular way of being which invariably sets in motion new avenues for capital to expand, allowing everything that has meaning to be hollowed-out and commodified for profit.

Returning to the example of the University of Montreal's new campus, the juxtaposition of the campus to Parc-Extension, as one of Canada's poorest and most culturally-diverse neighbourhoods, renders obvious the classist and racialised ways by which the emergence of ""coolness"" takes place.

Just who can extend particular aesthetics of hipness, eco-friendly chic and health-conscious consumption patterns is tightly associated with both class and inherited privilege to consume and waste more.

At the same time, it is these historically privileged individuals at the forefront of ""coolness"" that consciously or unconsciously accept the modern conceit of equating human progress with new forms of value to exploit for profit. In doing so, the violent ecological destruction and social displacement of the ensemble of humans and non-humans around the world which work to serve the forever unsatisfied aesthetics of the ""cool"" class become the unfortunate consequence.

What's potentially more problematic with the classist nature of green production and consumption is that urban hipsters pride themselves as being ""woke"" about sustainability issues, while simultaneously alienating the rural and overseas agricultural, peri-urban, and manufacturing classes, without whom ""hip"" lifestyles would not be possible.

Urban hipsters are quick to dismiss poorer classes as having no ""green consciousness"", for not living up to their expensive ""green"" standards, and failing to recognise the fact that opportunities to live ""green"" are limited in places that are economically disadvantaged and neglected by the authorities. They also tend to turn their backs on working-class political struggles for the fairer distribution of wealth and well-being across society.

On a global scale, capitalism is most certainly not ""cool""… it is literally burning our planet. An aloof, detached, apolitical coolness which centres on individuality and imagery is simply not going to cut it any more.

Such lifestyles may appear marginally efficient, but they are, by and large, a convenient by-product of shifting social and ecological costs to those less privileged both locally and globally.

One way to move forward in a positive direction is to abandon a singular focus on lifestyle choice to focus resistance on externally-conceived and profit-driven developments as a moral and even survivalist imperative and work to re-establish community through solidarity economies, replenishing those relations severed by the growth-centred logic.

Material or energy dematerialisation is simply not enough. It must be accompanied by an economy built on care and responsibility, rather than profit, growth and self-interest if it is to have any long-term impact. This is a small but absolutely crucial step towards attaining the authentic desires for sustainability that many of us are so dearly committed to and which we so urgently need.

12,"Why a hipster, vegan, green tech economy is not sustainable",Vijay Kolinjivadi Is A Post-Doctoral Researcher At The Universite Du Quebec En Outaouais,"On the western borderlands of Montreal's well-to-do Outremont district and the ultra-hipsterised and gentrified Mile End lies an expanse of land where the University of Montreal is currently building a new science campus. Just across is Parc-Extension, one of Canada's poorest and most densely populated neighbourhoods and a port of call for many newly arrived immigrants.

The new campus has been touted as a model of ""sustainable development"". It boasts LEED-certified buildings to reduce environmental impact, rainwater collection structures, energy-efficient lighting and heat recycling, infrastructure for electric vehicles and bikes, lots of greenery, and overall, a minimal carbon footprint. A number of tech companies, including Microsoft's new AI Hub, are moving in and are expected to further enhance the ""eco-efficiency"" of the area.

The unspoken expectation is that once the green new campus is completed, capital and economic growth will naturally flow into the area. This means nearby neighbourhoods will get ""revitalised"", especially the poorer ones, like Parc-Extension.

Thus, immigrant-owned grocery stores, halal butcheries and community centres will soon be replaced by vegan chain restaurants, hip vintage clothing joints, organic food stores and coffee-shops galore, as landlords push out poor tenants to make space for more well-to-do ones.

In the process, the implicit socio-economic violence behind gentrification will be invariably ""greenwashed"" and presented as development that would make the area more ""sustainable"", ""beautiful"" and ""modern"".

Unfortunately, creation by destruction is what capitalism does best, and its damaging practices are anything but green. This market-driven ""sustainable"" vision of economic activity, ecological-conscious diets and ""hipness"" within modern capitalism reinforce inequality and still hurt the environment.

Before I proceed further with my argument, I should mention that I am an academic, living in a ""hip"" part of Montreal and engage in activities that follow a particular aesthetic ethos, all of which make me very much a part of the reality I critique below. My aim is not to moralise, but rather to highlight the dangers of a political and economic system that profits from deceiving perhaps well-meaning self-proclaimed progressive folks into believing that a greener, more efficient capitalism is possible.

The illusion of 'sustainable development'

The term ""sustainable development"" was first introduced at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. At that time, Western governments espousing neoliberalism had just spent the whole previous decade dismantling unions, environmental regulations, and Keynesian welfare programmes and were looking to spread their practices elsewhere, as major geopolitical threats to a fully global and universal capitalist development trajectory were beginning to wane.

At the backdrop of these developments, concerns over environmental degradation and social inequality were coming to the fore and something had to be done about them.

The ""solution"" was to have one's cake and eat it too… that is, to paradoxically turn ""social"" and ""green"" values into new markets for expanding capital.

""Sustainable development"" not only proposed that negative social and environmental impacts were mere ""externalities"" to the system that could be diminished through profit-oriented market-based mechanisms but also implied that there is no escaping a neoliberal development model.

Thus, environmental problems became framed as an issue of inefficiency that could be solved by technology and the better management of resources, which effectively neutralised the politically-oriented environmentalism of the 1960s and 1970s.

An elite cadre of policy experts, economists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs took over the environmental issue and transformed it into another profit-making endeavour, presenting the expansion of capital as progress towards a more ""sustainable"" future.

In essence, environmentalism was and is consciously de-politicised for the purposes of expanding profit.

Part of the conceit surrounding apolitical techno-focused environmentalism centres on the idea of dematerialising economic growth through more efficient lifestyles and technologies. These include using the latest labour-saving apps on your phone, purchasing energy-saving appliances, eating vegan or organic food, and constructing buildings with lower negative environmental impact.

While these improvements in efficiency should indeed be applauded, they are not a solution to the major environmental problems we face today. This is because such ""quick fixes"" derive from the economic and political structures of capital expansion.

Growth-based economies are at the heart of environmental disasters we face today; making our goods, economic activity or infrastructure ""greener"" and more efficient without a major overhaul of the global economic system is not a long-term solution.

Improving efficiency would always involve maintaining and indeed expanding production to satisfy growing demand. This is reflected in the so-called ""Jevons paradox"", named after the 19th-century English economist William Stanley Jevons, who discovered that increasing energy efficiency also led to higher demand.

Today this ""rebound effect"" can be observed across economic sectors, as gains made due to enhanced efficiency are put back into use to fuel further growth. The higher efficiency of planes, cars and electronic devices is immediately offset by cheaper prices, resulting in an increase in demand and ultimately greater consumption of energy and resources. And within the globalised economic system we live in, the enhanced efficiency in one place often happens at the expense of growing inefficiency or waste in others.

In other words, the more efficient we are, the cheaper consumption gets, and in an economy predicated on endless growth, the more we consume and waste. The environment will always be at the losing endof this logic.

Working 'green'

When capitalism teams up with growth-oriented efficiency improvements, one result is the fabulous hipsterised ""green tech"" enclaves we see emerging in cities around the world, including Montreal.

These high-tech enterprises, along with the professions of the ""creative class"" (eg artists, musicians, academics, graphic designers etc), often concentrate in places where heavy industry and manufacturing have been shifted elsewhere in the same country or abroad. Rather than producing raw materials or manufactured goods, they focus on expert information provision.

Those who argue that growth can be accompanied by a dematerialising economic activity are convinced that these knowledge and creative classes of the service economy have somehow lower environmental impacts than those engaged in industrial agriculture or manufacturing (so-called ""dirty"" jobs). But is this information economy really any cleaner and greener?

Not really. This is because the resources they need to operate fundamentally depend on manufacturing and intensive agriculture located increasingly further away from their sites of operation, and often carry with them significant environmental impacts and exploitative labour practices.

Let us take the information economy's dependence on technology as an example. In their work, the creative classes both use and rely on the mass consumption of certain technological products, whose raw materials are extracted in war-torn places like the Democratic Republic of Congo and later assembled in places like China, where workers face precarious working conditions and inadequate pay.

High-tech devices may be advertised as extremely efficient, but the remarkably fast growth of the communications industry has not only increased the demand for material resources, boosting dangerous extractive industries in developing countries but also drastically expanded energy consumption. By 2020, IT would use as much as 20 percent of electricity globally, contributing significantly to carbon emissions.

This industry is also producing an ever-expanding amount of e-waste - currently the fastest-growing solid waste stream - which is shipped en masse to developing countries where it is polluting the environment and killing workers that recycle it.

Green tech enclaves may appear to be materially light compared to manufacturing, industrial agriculture, or mineral extraction only because they rely on goods produced elsewhere, usually beyond national borders. But exporting ""dirty production"" abroad and keeping national records ""cleaner"" does not make the service industry any greener.

Indeed, the fact that Montreal is not buried in heaps of e-waste has little to do with the ""green-ness"" of the city and much more to do with the Canadian government's pernicious practiceof shipping refuse abroad.

Eating 'green'

In recent years, veganism has also been sucked into the profit-making ""green"" economy. Its rising popularity is indeed quite mind-boggling. What was traditionally seen as a subversive and anti-establishment form of resistance to the global food industry and its horrific abuse of animals has increasingly become a ""cash cow"".

The reason why veganism has gone so mainstream is because of how it has been presented - as a ""win-win"" strategy. It's good for your health, it's good for the planet, and it's good for the animals! What's not to love about it? Indeed, there's nothing not to love about veganism per se.

But going vegan within a growth-based economy does not save you from the ""rebound effect"".

According to Oxford researcher Marco Springmann, if the world were to turn vegan by 2050, it would save $1.5 trillion in health-care costs and climate change damages, as it would cut greenhouse emissions by two thirds.

But in a capitalist economy, such a surplus would never simply be left idle. It would be re-invested into further growth, which would still consume more resources, exploit workers and produce waste and damage the environment in one way or the other.

A growing demand for vegan products would also be devastating for biodiversity because it would rely on monoculture fruit and vegetable crops (particularly soybeans). It would also necessitate expanding arable land by cutting down forests and increase the consumption of water for agriculture. It would also deepen already existing labour exploitation of vulnerable populations and further encourage large landowners and corporations to abuse small-scale farmers.

The dairy-free products in the health food stores in Montreal's hip Plateau and Mile End districts are often tagged ""cruelty-free"", but they may not actually be. If no animals were abused in the making, that does not mean that humans and/or the environment weren't.

The cashews for that delicious non-dairy milk you buy likely come from India, where women work long hours in poor conditions to shell the nuts, enduring painful injuries from the acid released in the process. The almonds for the equally delicious almond option are likely sourced from drought-stricken California, where almond farming is one of the largest consumers of water.

Indeed, growth-oriented capitalism will ""sell"" you veganism as a noble practice that reflects your values and benefits your health, but it would not tell you the full story about the ongoing and long-term social and ecological consequences of industrial veganism.

""I got teased mercilessly for being overweight back then,"" 51-year-old Marley, the eldest child of reggae icon Bob Marley tells Al Jazeera.

""Today it's the rounder, plumper girls that are in, and it's the muscular girls who are looked at as being unattractive. But we have to grow as a people in Jamaica, and we have to embrace people who don't look the way that we think they should,"" Marley said.

""And especially when you're representing your country as athletes, the only thing we should care about is if you're good. Nothing else should matter.""

190602073236020

Marley has been championing body positivity in sport ever since she became involved with the Reggae Girlz - Jamaica's women’s football team who are making history as the first side from the Caribbean ever to compete at the women's World Cup - five years ago.

Back in 2014, she began championing their cause and sponsoring the team through the Bob Marley Foundation after hearing that the Jamaican Football Federation (JFF) had disbanded the squad and cut their funding three years earlier.

But she became increasingly irate at the prevailing culture within Jamaica when she repeatedly tried to find corporate brands to sponsor the team.

The rejections were not because the team lacked talent, but because they were athletic, and female.

""The biggest thing which irritated me was people saying no, just because they're young women playing football,"" Marley said.

""I didn't understand why that was such a big issue. When I asked why these companies were refusing to help, they would reply, 'Well, the girls look too much like men'.""

""So they weren't getting the opportunity to chase their dreams, because of other people's preferences of what a female body should look like. And I don’t like that. I have three sons, and I can't imagine them trying out for a sport, and having someone say, 'Your skin is too dark. That doesn't fit into what we believe a team should look like. Can you imagine?'""

'Kept our heads above water'

Over the past five years, Marley's determination has almost single-handedly helped make the team's dreams reality, putting together a global crowdfunding project to finance their victorious qualifying campaign last year.

But with no help from the federation, the budget was miniscule. Until recently the entire coaching staff were volunteers, while the players have become accustomed to paying for everything from their own kit, to meals.

""Cedella literally kept our heads above water,"" said goalkeeper Yazmeen Jamieson. ""We wouldn't have anything without her.""

Cedella Marley, daughter of Bob Marley [File: The Associated Press]

The federation insists that the decision to strip the team’s funding eight years ago was entirely due to tight budget constraints, rather than an indifferent attitude to women's sport.

""Each country’s circumstances are different,"" says Dalton Wint, JFF general secretary. ""People don't realise how expensive it is. It costs $200,000 to run just one training camp.""

However, the players themselves are more cynical, suspecting that football is still perceived throughout the country as a game which is meant only for men.

190606184507712

Jamieson points to how the Jamaican men's team, the Reggae Boyz, are still handsomely funded, despite having not qualified for the World Cup since 1998.

""The Reggae Boyz get to travel everywhere, but they're not even winning,"" she says. ""And we are qualifying for the World Cup with the bare minimum, and it's like, imagine if you gave us that support.""

""When the Reggae Boyz qualified in 1998, they were each given land and a house. What did we get? $2,000. Which is nothing given that in the past two years, I've paid for so much, while competing for the team.""

'Not all about the money'

Midfielder Allyson Swaby said the main issue is not so much the comparative amounts of money, but simply respect.

""People think, 'Oh these girls just want to get paid as much as the men',"" she says. ""But it's not all about money, it's about being treated with professionalism,"" lamented Swaby.

""As an example, the World Cup will be the first time we actually have jerseys with our names on them. There's no international male players going out on the field without their names on the back of their jerseys.""

Even after reaching the World Cup, there has been an uneasy relationship between the Reggae Girlz and the rest of the country.

190603094539380

Jamieson describes their qualification celebrations last December as low-key with a mere handful of people turning out to watch the team parade around the island.

She believes that one of the reasons for such lack of support has been a combination of Jamaica's complicated relationships with sexuality and women's sport.

""With Jamaicans, homosexuality is a very taboo subject,"" she said. ""When I first joined the team, a lot of the girls were lesbians and very open about it, so people didn't want to support the Reggae Girlz because they were like, 'Oh they're just men, they're manly, they're all gay'.""

But the funding has at least belatedly arrived. Since February, sponsors ranging from Caribbean Airlines to beverage company Wisynco have pledged support for the Reggae Girlz World Cup campaign, while the JFF has contributed more than $1m to finance the team's preparations before and during the tournament.

""The World Cup is a special project,"" Wint said. ""This has never been done before, so we decided that this is something special.""

""The girls have gifted this to us, and so we have done something special for them. The whole campaign in France is costing around $2m, and more than 50 percent of that is coming from the JFF coffers.""

In recognition of the achievement, the JFF has also offered several of the players their first-ever official contracts for female footballers, ensuring that they will be paid a salary from January to August 2019.

Trust Deficit, another issue

However, trust levels between players and federation remain low.

The Reggae Girlz refused to sign the contracts for several months, a stand-off which lasted until early May, claiming that the initial offer was not satisfactory.

In addition, the team's pre-World Cup training camp in Scotland was marred by a scheduling mix-up which meant several members of the squad were severely delayed because they did not have the correct visas.

""It's hard for us to trust the federation because there's just been so many issues,"" Jamieson said.

""I know they say that they're trying but at the same time, it's really hard for me to believe it. I don't know where half the money goes, because they say we're getting all this money and we don't see it.""

But while the team are determined to make a mark in France, there are question marks in the back of their minds about their future.

The JFF has refused to make any promises regarding funding the team beyond August.

""This is the first time that we're seeing the women's program entertaining a serious adventure,"" Wint said. ""But it's affordability that determines what we do going forward.""

However, Marley insists that whatever happens at the World Cup, she refuses to quit backing the team.

""The Reggae Girlz have given me something to look forward to,"" said Marley.

""Football in the Caribbean has been seen as a men's sport and female players haven't been taken seriously, but hopefully this can bring a real change in that perception. This is my hope, not only for the federation but for Jamaica as a whole to support the girls.

""And for companies out there, if people want to look at the Reggae Girlz as a business, they're a viable marketing investment. Believe me, I know something about that. But whatever happens, I can handle this fight. We're going to do it with corporate Jamaica or without them.""

15,Fishermen fear for future as Malaysia mulls Penang reclamation,Kate Mayberry,"Sungai Batu, Penang, Malaysia - People from the villages hugging Penang's southern coast have fished the seas off the Malaysian island for generations, scooping up prawns and digging out crabs to feed its food-loving residents.

The fishermen know the vagaries of tide and wind, and the dangers of the monsoon that sweeps in each June.

But now their existence is under threat.

The government of the state of Penang wants to create three artificial islands covering 1,821 hectares off the gently curving bays where the fishermen live and work to help pay for an ambitious $11bn transport plan to ease traffic congestion, improve public transit services and relieve what it says is development pressure on the hilly and forested island.

The state includes parts of the mainland, connected by two bridges as well as a ferry service, but most tourists are drawn to the family-friendly beach resorts on the island's northern coast, the colonial-era capital of George Town and the rainforest-topped hills.

Assuming the three-island project gets the green light by the federal government, the construction of the islands and the subsequent development of an industrial park, housing estates and green public spaces would take between 30 and 50 years.

Fisherman Talib Seman on the jetty at Sungai Batu on the southern coast of the Malaysian island of Penang; the state government wants to create three artificial islands in the sea that he fears will destroy his livelihood [Kate Mayberry/Al Jazeera]

""This is the golden place in Penang,"" explained Zakaria Ismail, a fisherman in Sungai Batu, one of the villages which will be affected by the plan, leaning against a railing on a jetty hung with fishing nets. ""You can go out anytime - morning or afternoon - and you get prawns, shellfish, even oysters.""

In the bay, sheltered by a breakwater, bright blue wooden boats bob in the tide and some of the fishermen snooze on hammocks slung between the trees along the beach.

The men here do not go far out to sea and mostly use traditional flat-bottomed boats fitted with outboard engines. It is not a lifestyle that has made them wealthy, but it is what they have done for generations.

""We only have small boats,"" said Talib Seman, a 40-year veteran of the industry. ""If there's reclamation, where are we going to go? There's no way we can go out.""

Talib points out across the water. ""[The reclamation] will go from one end to the other.""

'Developer-driven'

Penang's fishing community is at the forefront of a campaign to stop what critics fear will destroy fishing grounds, cause irreparable damage to the environment and undermine food security.

Their objections, backed by Malaysia's Fisheries Department, led to the project's rejection in 2017 after the filing of an initial Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) - a requirement for any reclamation project of more than 50 hectares.

With the federal government considering the state's application anew, the fishermen and at least 45 civil society groups from across Malaysia are appealing to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to block the project. They plan to march on parliament in Kuala Lumpur in July.

Reclamation is an increasing feature of Malaysia's western coast, but the creation of man-made islands has attracted controversy for the environmental and financial costs.

Objections from neighbouring Singapore - itself no stranger to reclamation - forced modifications to the 19 square-kilometres Forest City by Chinese developers in southern Malaysia in the narrow channel facing the city-state.

Meanwhile, traditional fishermen in Melaka have struggled to cope with the decline in fish stocks and the rise in siltation fuelled by another China-backed reclamation project under construction off the coast of the historic city.

In Tanjung Tokong, in Penang's northwest, where an undersea road tunnel that is also part of the transport plan is due to be built, another reclamation project is nearing completion.

On a still early June evening, the water laps at the black mud along the rock-filled shoreline as dredgers, excavators and barges - the artillery of the reclamation industry - create land where once there was sea.

They are building an island of nearly 364 hectares, and much of the new land will be used for high-rise apartments and luxury homes where there is already an oversupply. The fishermen and their boats have all but disappeared.

""It's basically a developer-driven vision that the government has,"" said Mohideen Abdul Kadeer, acting president of the Consumers Association of Penang, referring to the state government. ""They are very much influenced by the developers. That's why some people joke it's not a Penang Transport Master Plan, but a Penang Developers Master Plan.""

The state government is behind the three-island proposal but it has appointed SRS Consortium - a joint venture between Gamuda, one of Malaysia's biggest construction companies - and two local developers to lead the development.

Penang has a long history of reclamation, but the pace and scale of the current projects have alarmed campaigners; off the former fishing village of Tanjong Tokong in the island's northwest, a new island is taking shape [Kate Mayberry/Al Jazeera]

Crucial for growth

The transport plan is supposed to reduce congestion in George Town - a World Heritage-listed city that has emerged as a hugely popular tourist destination in the past few years - with a combination of the tunnel, three giant expressways snaking around and through the hills, and a light rail line.

The state of Penang is home to more than 1.7 million people, with about 800,000 living on the island and some 946,000 on the mainland.

Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow denies the transport plan is too focused on cars and insists the three-island project is crucial to Penang's growth over the next few decades, providing the means to ensure the state's infrastructure can cope with a larger population as well as an expanded electronics and technology industry, a major sector in the island's economy.

""If our forefathers had not done anything to create over 1,000 acres [404 hectares of land] from north to south, then Penang would not be what it is today; a small state punching above its weight as a Silicon Valley of the east [and] as a renowned tourist destination,"" Chow told Al Jazeera. ""We recognise that the landscape will be changed permanently with the reclamation, but it is a price we consider seriously knowing that it serves the future of the state.""

He told Al Jazeera ""significant improvements"" had been made since the first EIA for the project was rejected two years ago, but declined to go into details.

The chief minister met representatives of the fishing community at the end of May and said a ""breakthrough"" had been reached, noting the delegation had been willing to discuss issues such as compensation and the acquisition of larger, more modern boats that would allow them to travel further out to sea.

But Nazri Ahmad, chairman of the Fishermen's Association of Penang Island, who led the group, says their number one priority remains to stop the project.

""For the fishermen, the sea is their life,"" Nazri told Al Jazeera. He estimates about 1,800 fishermen are at risk from the southern reclamation plans.

""These are areas the government should protect,"" he said. ""We believe it's our khazanah negara (national treasure).""

The livelihoods of fishermen in the neighbouring states of Perak and Kedah, who also fish in the seas off Penang, are at stake, too, along with extensive aquaculture industry. The two states will also be affected by plans to source the 189.1 million cubic-metres of sand and rocks to build the islands.

Climate risk

Yee Lai Wan retired to the sleepy village of Gertak Sanggul in southern Penang more than 10 years ago. Little more than a single street, squeezed in between the sea and the hills, the village is dotted with Chinese shrines where visitors venture out onto the mudflats with their buckets at low tide to search for cockles and crabs. The village's jetty has long since disintegrated.

The bay is the proposed site of the last of the three man-made islands. Yee, an environmental expert who once worked in Hong Kong, is vehemently opposed to the project.

Creating the islands for an industrial park and what has been tagged a ""smart"" and ""green"" city is expected to drive carbon emissions - an extra 3.2 million tonnes a year, according to the National Physical Planning Council - increasing climate pressures at a time when Penang is already suffering more often from floods and landslides.

""They don't seem to understand that the world is moving away from these kinds of projects where you destroy an area in order to build something else,"" she said of the project's backers. ""If it's making the fishermen worse off, then it's not sustainable and it shouldn't be happening.""

In Sungai Batu's modest fish market, the day's catch is heaped in plastic baskets on white tiles. Local residents pick out their favourite fish, as the neighbourhood's stray cats stalk the aisles.

On the breakwater, an excavator is on standby for the near endless process of scooping up the mud that builds up around the river mouth - made worse during the monsoon when the seabed is stirred up by the stronger winds and currents, according to the fishermen.

The village fears the reclamation will add to the problem and clog up the 250-metre channels that are supposed to separate the new islands.

Zakaria, on behalf of some 200 fishermen in his community, wrote again to the Department of Environment this month detailing his concerns about the project.

At the end of his letter, Zakaria turned to a verse from the Quran - a warning that many of the people who end up causing disaster are the very people who think they are doing good. He was afraid the department was among them, he said.

""Life on earth is only a brief moment, but heaven is for eternity,"" he wrote in Malay. ""Pray for those who are wrong for God will be the one who will judge.""","The fishermen know the vagaries of tide and wind, and the dangers of the monsoon that sweeps in each June.

16,'We need urgent help': Refugees perish in Libyan detention centre,Sally Hayden,"Refugees and migrants in Zintan detention centre, northwest Libya, have told Al Jazeera that every morning, they gather in front of a makeshift church to pray for the dead.

The place of worship is crafted from food cartons and mattress sponge - coloured red with scraps of towels, green from cut-up sheets, and white from Colgate toothpaste that was handed out in aid packages.

At least 22 migrants and refugees have died in Zintan since last September, according to refugees and staff of international organisations in Libya.

Those who have perished included a Gambian father and son who died weeks apart, according to others detained there. The mother of the boy survived and was later released, they say.

Many who died are Christian and are yet to be buried because of a lack of provision for non-Muslim burials. Some bodies were stored in the detention centre before being moved to morgues in local hospitals, where they remain, according to detainees and aid workers.

Employees of international organisations working in Libya declined to comment on the record, because they could lose access to the detention centre, 180km southwest of Tripoli, which is ostensibly under the control of Libya's Department for Combatting Illegal Migration. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one described the number of deaths as a ""major scandal.""

Libyan authorities did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Detainees still in Zintan provided Al Jazeera with a list of the names, photos and nationalities of most of the dead. Many of those who died were returned to indefinite detention by the EU-supported Libyan coastguard, after they tried to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea.

The EU has been providing training and equipment to the Libyan coastguard for the past two years, in a bid to disrupt smugglers and stem migration to Europe, under a deal that has been repeatedly condemned by human rights groups.

In some parts of the centre, toilets are overflowing and are in urgent need of repair. As a result, solid waste and garbage has piled up inside the cell for days and presents a serious health threat UNHCR spokesperson

Hundreds of detained refugees and migrants were moved from Tripoli to Zintan last September, after detention centres in the capital were caught on the front lines of clashes.

The area is difficult to reach from Tripoli, because of security issues along the road, including fighting between rival militias.

Detainees in Zintan say medical aid is lacking, and - in recent weeks - when doctors visited from the International Medical Corps, the organisation charged with healthcare in Zintan, they only spoke to refugees and migrants through a small window, without entering the hall in which they are being held.

Before that, only a few detainees were allowed outside see medical workers each time they visited, while the rest were kept locked up, they say.

Refugees and migrants need treatment for tuberculosis, chest infections, anaemia, diarrhoea and scabies, among other ailments, but are only offered paracetamol and ibuprofen, they say.

""Do you think by these methods they'll cure us?"" said one Eritrean man.

The International Medical Corps did not respond to a request for comment.

Detainees say they are being fed at most once a day and water taps are opened for just 10 minutes in the morning: only enough time to pour one cup of water each, at most.

Earlier this year, after the number of bodies began to pile up in Zintan, dozens of the most unwell were moved to another detention centre in Gharyan, 113km northeast by road, according to detainees and staff of visiting organisations.

At least seven of those who were moved have also died since, say sources, including a woman who escaped Gharyan.

'We need urgent help'

Zintan detention centre was not built for people: the hall that held the refugees was previously used for storing crops. There are currently seven toilets for more than 500 people.

An Eritrean man detained there, who communicated with Al Jazeera using a hidden phone and asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, appealed for support.

""At this moment, we need urgent help. We are in a bad condition,"" he said.

Another Eritrean said: ""We are sick, hungry and dying as well as being exposed to different diseases. How many people are dying in the detentions untold?""

The man said dozens of people with him have tuberculosis. Four detainees tried to kill themselves by grabbing hold of electrical wire running through the hall, before electricity was cut off three weeks ago. Fellow detainees tied their hands together to stop them from trying again, he said.

In photos and a video sent to Al Jazeera, a large pile of rubbish can be seen in one part of the hall, with insects crawling across it.

Another photo shows detainees protesting by writing on mattress sponge with tomato paste. ""We need emergency"", ""We are innocent refugees"" and ""We are being starved to death,"" the signs read.

On Monday, 96 people were moved from Zintan to the United Nations Refugee Agency's Gathering and Departure Facility in Tripoli.

In a statement to Al Jazeera, a UNHCR spokesperson said they are ""deeply concerned"" at the reports of deaths in Zintan, and called conditions dire.

""Living areas are severely overcrowded and lack proper ventilation. In some parts of the centre, toilets are overflowing and are in urgent need of repair. As a result, solid waste and garbage has piled up inside the cell for days and presents a serious health threat.""

More than 650 people remain in Zintan detention centre, according to UNHCR.

""A lot of people are dead within a short period. Even we are near death,"" said one of the Eritreans who was left behind. ""We are the victims, we need a safe life, we need our rights. For us, it is a black history. We are scared, we are suffering emotionally, psychologically.""

18,Torture in Saudi prisons: 'Most oppressive era we have witnessed',Kareem Chehayeb,"Days after Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive in September 2017, blogger and activist Eman al-Nafjan wrote an uplifting column on CNN.

Praising the tenacity of women's rights activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul, she said: ""Other issues seem conquerable. The biggest issue at the moment is the guardianship system.""

Eight months later, al-Nafjan, Loujain al-Hathloul, and other women's rights activists and male allies were arrested.

They became victims of a widespread online and offline smear campaign, accusing them of trying to destabilise the country and incite public opinion.

Since their arrest, there have been allegations of prisoners being tortured - with reports of lashings and electric shocks while in custody.

Three Saudi Muslim scholars who are linked to the Sahwa, or the Awakening movement, who are reportedly on death row and could be executed in days, are also believed to have suffered in prison.

Salman al-Awdah was hospitalised as a result of solitary confinement, according to Amnesty International, Awad al-Qarni health has also deteriorated, according to activists, while Ali al-Omari has reportedly suffered burns and injuries all over his body as a result of electric shocks during solitary confinement for more than a year.

Adam Coogle, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera: ""You have serious allegations of torture by investigators. This is something you will frequently hear from other human rights activists as well.""

Among these prisons are al-Haer in Riyadh, Dhahban near Jeddah, and Dammam in the Eastern Province.

Women's rights defenders, protesters from the predominantly Shia Muslim minority Eastern Province, and other dissidents often stand trial at the Specialised Criminal Court,the kingdom's counterterrorism court.

""Most human rights activists and dissidents are in [both] Mabahith-run prisons or general prisons,"" Yahya Assiri, a Saudi activist who founded the human rights organisation Al Qst, told Al Jazeera.

While general prisons are run by the Ministry of Interior, maximum security prisons are headed by the police agency of the Presidency of the State Security, commonly known as the Mabahith.

Conditions in the general prisons are abysmal and worse than in the maximum security facilities, said Assiri, adding that corporal punishment is common while corruption has fuelled an illicit drug smuggling trade.

""These facilities are far more outdated than maximum security prisons, and cells are often overcrowded,"" he said.

In its 2018 annual report, Al Qst claimed that authorities forced prisoners to sleep in the toilets.

Essam Koshak, an activist and computer engineer was arrested in January 2017 for speaking out against the male guardianship system on Twitter, and sentenced to four years in prison followed by a four-year travel ban.

Though he was tried in the Specialised Criminal Court, he was held in Mecca General Prison before being transferred to the maximum security al-Haer Prison in Riyadh.

Similarly, activist Issa al-Nukheifi was held in pre-trial detention in Mecca General Prison without any charges presented. At the Specialised Criminal Court, he was sentenced to six years in prison followed by a six-year travel ban over Twitter posts criticising the Saudi royal family and government. He is also being held at al-Haer.

Though conditions at Mabahith-run facilities are relatively better, Assiri said that overall, prisons built and administered for detainees suspected of terrorism or other extreme security charges are ""extraordinarily worse than before"".

Although several activists have been temporarily released as their trials proceed, it is expected that they could face 20 years in prison, as per Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism law.

Saudi Arabia has acceded to the UN Convention Against Torture - with reservations, but reports from human rights organisations and testimonies indicate that systematic torture is widespread with impunity.

We have seen this happen before, but not at this kind of scale. It's the most oppressive era we have witnessed. Hala al-Dosari, Saudi scholar and activist

According to Al Qst, while no independent and private visits to prisons have been allowed, there are mounting allegations that prisoners are being tortured during interrogations while being held at maximum security facilities.

Assiri told Al Jazeera that he has documented a wide array of harrowing torture methods, including electrocution, waterboarding and suspending victims from the ceiling by their wrists.

Al Qst's 2018 report said that prominent reformers and women's rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Samar Badawi, and at least six others, were subjected to ""brutal"" physical and psychological torture.

Amnesty International has said it received testimonies last November of alleged torture of detained women's rights activists, including sexual harassment by masked men, in Dhahban Prison. The victims have claimed that as a result they struggled to walk, shook uncontrollably and had marks on their bodies. One reportedly attempted to take their own life.

More recently, an internal medical document reportedly prepared for the Saudi authorities, intercepted by The Guardian in March, suggested that the health of some 60 prisoners was so dire they needed to be transferred to a medical facility.

The newspaper cited cases of malnutrition and prisoners having bruises, cuts, burns and other marks on their bodies.

""We believe that at least one - if not all - of these reports is accurate,"" Coogle told Al Jazeera, adding that he has documented similar cases in maximum security prisons in the Eastern Province, where political dissidents from the country's Shia Muslim minority are often held before trials and after being convicted.

""We have heard pretty nasty stories about what happens there,"" he said.

Increasing reports of torture being used in prisons come as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is commonly known as MBS, prepares to rule the kingdom. The young leader is widely believed to be leading efforts to stifle dissent.

""We have seen this happen before, but not at this kind of scale,"" said Hala al-Dosari, a Saudi scholar and activist at New York University's Center of Human Rights and Global Justice, adding that MBS's strategy is founded on increasing crackdowns in parallel with a global public relations campaign. ""It's the most oppressive era we have witnessed.""

Omaima al-Najjar, a Saudi feminist, blogger, and political refugee in Italy, told Al Jazeera that she has witnessed more self-censorship in recent months.

""I used to frequently read modest critiques of the government in some newspapers such as Al-Watan, but now, you don't see that at all anymore,"" she said, noting the October 2018 assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey.

""There were discussions among ordinary people in public spaces about what happened with Khashoggi,"" al-Najjar said. ""But the conversation came to a complete standstill the moment Saudi admitted responsibility.""

As long as they think they have the US administration in their pocket, they can do whatever they want. Adam Coogle, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch

However, the international community has not been entirely silent, following Khashoggi's assassination and as the Saudi-led coalition continues to attack Yemen.

The United States has issued travel bans against 16 Saudis and their immediate families linked to MBS. A handful of European states, Germany, Belgium, Finland, and Norway, have suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its coalition allies as a result of its actions in Yemen. Saudi Arabia's key arms dealers, the US, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada have not ended sales yet.

Al-Dosari believes these measures are a positive start, but not sufficient to deter further human rights violations. She hopes the international outrage over the Khashoggi scandal and atrocities in Yemen will result in more attention on the kingdom's domestic affairs.

""I think that [the Khashoggi killing] was a moment of clarity for so many people,"" she said. ""It set the record of what the nature of the regime is in Saudi Arabia, even for Saudis - not just the international community.""

Looking ahead, analysts have said that MBS's future relies heavily on the support of US President Donald Trump and his administration, especially since the US leader issued strong support after Khashoggi was murdered.

19,Torture in Saudi prisons: 'Most oppressive era we have witnessed',About The Author,"Days after Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive in September 2017, blogger and activist Eman al-Nafjan wrote an uplifting column on CNN.

Praising the tenacity of women's rights activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul, she said: ""Other issues seem conquerable. The biggest issue at the moment is the guardianship system.""

Eight months later, al-Nafjan, Loujain al-Hathloul, and other women's rights activists and male allies were arrested.

They became victims of a widespread online and offline smear campaign, accusing them of trying to destabilise the country and incite public opinion.

Since their arrest, there have been allegations of prisoners being tortured - with reports of lashings and electric shocks while in custody.

Three Saudi Muslim scholars who are linked to the Sahwa, or the Awakening movement, who are reportedly on death row and could be executed in days, are also believed to have suffered in prison.

20,How Britain stole $45 trillion from India,Jason Hickel,"There is a story that is commonly told in Britain that the colonisation of India - as horrible as it may have been - was not of any major economic benefit to Britain itself. If anything, the administration of India was a cost to Britain. So the fact that the empire was sustained for so long - the story goes - was a gesture of Britain's benevolence.

New research by the renowned economist Utsa Patnaik - just published by Columbia University Press - deals a crushing blow to this narrative. Drawing on nearly two centuries of detailed data on tax and trade, Patnaik calculated that Britain drained a total of nearly $45 trillion from India during the period 1765 to 1938.

It's a staggering sum. For perspective, $45 trillion is 17 times more than the total annual gross domestic product of the United Kingdom today.

How did this come about?

It happened through the trade system. Prior to the colonial period, Britain bought goods like textiles and rice from Indian producers and paid for them in the normal way - mostly with silver - as they did with any other country. But something changed in 1765, shortly after the East India Company took control of the subcontinent and established a monopoly over Indian trade.

Here's how it worked. The East India Company began collecting taxes in India, and then cleverly used a portion of those revenues (about a third) to fund the purchase of Indian goods for British use. In other words, instead of paying for Indian goods out of their own pocket, British traders acquired them for free, ""buying"" from peasants and weavers using money that had just been taken from them.

It was a scam - theft on a grand scale. Yet most Indians were unaware of what was going on because the agent who collected the taxes was not the same as the one who showed up to buy their goods. Had it been the same person, they surely would have smelled a rat.

Some of the stolen goods were consumed in Britain, and the rest were re-exported elsewhere. The re-export system allowed Britain to finance a flow of imports from Europe, including strategic materials like iron, tar and timber, which were essential to Britain's industrialisation. Indeed, the Industrial Revolution depended in large part on this systematic theft from India.

On top of this, the British were able to sell the stolen goods to other countries for much more than they ""bought"" them for in the first place, pocketing not only 100 percent of the original value of the goods but also the markup.

After the British Raj took over in 1858, colonisers added a special new twist to the tax-and-buy system. As the East India Company's monopoly broke down, Indian producers were allowed to export their goods directly to other countries. But Britain made sure that the payments for those goods nonetheless ended up in London.

How did this work? Basically, anyone who wanted to buy goods from India would do so using special Council Bills - a unique paper currency issued only by the British Crown. And the only way to get those bills was to buy them from London with gold or silver. So traders would pay London in gold to get the bills, and then use the bills to pay Indian producers. When Indians cashed the bills in at the local colonial office, they were ""paid"" in rupees out of tax revenues - money that had just been collected from them. So, once again, they were not in fact paid at all; they were defrauded.

Meanwhile, London ended up with all of the gold and silver that should have gone directly to the Indians in exchange for their exports.

This corrupt system meant that even while India was running an impressive trade surplus with the rest of the world - a surplus that lasted for three decades in the early 20th century - it showed up as a deficit in the national accounts because the real income from India's exports was appropriated in its entirety by Britain.

Some point to this fictional ""deficit"" as evidence that India was a liability to Britain. But exactly the opposite is true. Britain intercepted enormous quantities of income that rightly belonged to Indian producers. India was the goose that laid the golden egg. Meanwhile, the ""deficit"" meant that India had no option but to borrow from Britain to finance its imports. So the entire Indian population was forced into completely unnecessary debt to their colonial overlords, further cementing British control.

Britain used the windfall from this fraudulent system to fuel the engines of imperial violence - funding the invasion of China in the 1840s and the suppression of the Indian Rebellion in 1857. And this was on top of what the Crown took directly from Indian taxpayers to pay for its wars. As Patnaik points out, ""the cost of all Britain's wars of conquest outside Indian borders were charged always wholly or mainly to Indian revenues.""

And that's not all. Britain used this flow of tribute from India to finance the expansion of capitalism in Europe and regions of European settlement, like Canada and Australia. So not only the industrialisation of Britain but also the industrialisation of much of the Western world was facilitated by extraction from the colonies.

Patnaik identifies four distinct economic periods in colonial India from 1765 to 1938, calculates the extraction for each, and then compounds at a modest rate of interest (about 5 percent, which is lower than the market rate) from the middle of each period to the present. Adding it all up, she finds that the total drain amounts to $44.6 trillion. This figure is conservative, she says, and does not include the debts that Britain imposed on India during the Raj.

These are eye-watering sums. But the true costs of this drain cannot be calculated. If India had been able to invest its own tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings in development - as Japan did - there's no telling how history might have turned out differently. India could very well have become an economic powerhouse. Centuries of poverty and suffering could have been prevented.

All of this is a sobering antidote to the rosy narrative promoted by certain powerful voices in Britain. The conservative historian Niall Ferguson has claimed that British rule helped ""develop"" India. While he was prime minister, David Cameron asserted that British rule was a net help to India.

This narrative has found considerable traction in the popular imagination: according to a 2014 YouGov poll, 50 percent of people in Britain believe that colonialism was beneficial to the colonies.

Yet during the entire 200-year history of British rule in India, there was almost no increase in per capita income. In fact, during the last half of the 19th century - the heyday of British intervention - income in India collapsed by half. The average life expectancy of Indians dropped by a fifth from 1870 to 1920. Tens of millions died needlessly of policy-induced famine.

Britain didn't develop India. Quite the contrary - as Patnaik's work makes clear - India developed Britain.

What does this require of Britain today? An apology? Absolutely. Reparations? Perhaps - although there is not enough money in all of Britain to cover the sums that Patnaik identifies. In the meantime, we can start by setting the story straight. We need to recognise that Britain retained control of India not out of benevolence but for the sake of plunder and that Britain's industrial rise didn't emerge sui generis from the steam engine and strong institutions, as our schoolbooks would have it, but depended on violent theft from other lands and other peoples.

If anything, the administration of India was a cost to Britain. So the fact that the empire was sustained for so long - the story goes - was a gesture of Britain's benevolence.

New research by the renowned economist Utsa Patnaik - just published by Columbia University Press - deals a crushing blow to this narrative. Drawing on nearly two centuries of detailed data on tax and trade, Patnaik calculated that Britain drained a total of nearly $45 trillion from India during the period 1765 to 1938.

It's a staggering sum. For perspective, $45 trillion is 17 times more than the total annual gross domestic product of the United Kingdom today.

How did this come about?

It happened through the trade system. Prior to the colonial period, Britain bought goods like textiles and rice from Indian producers and paid for them in the normal way - mostly with silver - as they did with any other country. But something changed in 1765, shortly after the East India Company took control of the subcontinent and established a monopoly over Indian trade.

Here's how it worked. The East India Company began collecting taxes in India, and then cleverly used a portion of those revenues (about a third) to fund the purchase of Indian goods for British use. In other words, instead of paying for Indian goods out of their own pocket, British traders acquired them for free, ""buying"" from peasants and weavers using money that had just been taken from them.

It was a scam - theft on a grand scale. Yet most Indians were unaware of what was going on because the agent who collected the taxes was not the same as the one who showed up to buy their goods. Had it been the same person, they surely would have smelled a rat.

Some of the stolen goods were consumed in Britain, and the rest were re-exported elsewhere. The re-export system allowed Britain to finance a flow of imports from Europe, including strategic materials like iron, tar and timber, which were essential to Britain's industrialisation. Indeed, the Industrial Revolution depended in large part on this systematic theft from India.

On top of this, the British were able to sell the stolen goods to other countries for much more than they ""bought"" them for in the first place, pocketing not only 100 percent of the original value of the goods but also the markup.

After the British Raj took over in 1858, colonisers added a special new twist to the tax-and-buy system. As the East India Company's monopoly broke down, Indian producers were allowed to export their goods directly to other countries. But Britain made sure that the payments for those goods nonetheless ended up in London.

How did this work? Basically, anyone who wanted to buy goods from India would do so using special Council Bills - a unique paper currency issued only by the British Crown. And the only way to get those bills was to buy them from London with gold or silver. So traders would pay London in gold to get the bills, and then use the bills to pay Indian producers. When Indians cashed the bills in at the local colonial office, they were ""paid"" in rupees out of tax revenues - money that had just been collected from them. So, once again, they were not in fact paid at all; they were defrauded.

Meanwhile, London ended up with all of the gold and silver that should have gone directly to the Indians in exchange for their exports.

This corrupt system meant that even while India was running an impressive trade surplus with the rest of the world - a surplus that lasted for three decades in the early 20th century - it showed up as a deficit in the national accounts because the real income from India's exports was appropriated in its entirety by Britain.

Some point to this fictional ""deficit"" as evidence that India was a liability to Britain. But exactly the opposite is true. Britain intercepted enormous quantities of income that rightly belonged to Indian producers. India was the goose that laid the golden egg. Meanwhile, the ""deficit"" meant that India had no option but to borrow from Britain to finance its imports. So the entire Indian population was forced into completely unnecessary debt to their colonial overlords, further cementing British control.

Britain used the windfall from this fraudulent system to fuel the engines of imperial violence - funding the invasion of China in the 1840s and the suppression of the Indian Rebellion in 1857. And this was on top of what the Crown took directly from Indian taxpayers to pay for its wars. As Patnaik points out, ""the cost of all Britain's wars of conquest outside Indian borders were charged always wholly or mainly to Indian revenues.""

And that's not all. Britain used this flow of tribute from India to finance the expansion of capitalism in Europe and regions of European settlement, like Canada and Australia. So not only the industrialisation of Britain but also the industrialisation of much of the Western world was facilitated by extraction from the colonies.

Patnaik identifies four distinct economic periods in colonial India from 1765 to 1938, calculates the extraction for each, and then compounds at a modest rate of interest (about 5 percent, which is lower than the market rate) from the middle of each period to the present. Adding it all up, she finds that the total drain amounts to $44.6 trillion. This figure is conservative, she says, and does not include the debts that Britain imposed on India during the Raj.

These are eye-watering sums. But the true costs of this drain cannot be calculated. If India had been able to invest its own tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings in development - as Japan did - there's no telling how history might have turned out differently. India could very well have become an economic powerhouse. Centuries of poverty and suffering could have been prevented.

All of this is a sobering antidote to the rosy narrative promoted by certain powerful voices in Britain. The conservative historian Niall Ferguson has claimed that British rule helped ""develop"" India. While he was prime minister, David Cameron asserted that British rule was a net help to India.

This narrative has found considerable traction in the popular imagination: according to a 2014 YouGov poll, 50 percent of people in Britain believe that colonialism was beneficial to the colonies.

Yet during the entire 200-year history of British rule in India, there was almost no increase in per capita income. In fact, during the last half of the 19th century - the heyday of British intervention - income in India collapsed by half. The average life expectancy of Indians dropped by a fifth from 1870 to 1920. Tens of millions died needlessly of policy-induced famine.

Britain didn't develop India. Quite the contrary - as Patnaik's work makes clear - India developed Britain.

What does this require of Britain today? An apology? Absolutely. Reparations? Perhaps - although there is not enough money in all of Britain to cover the sums that Patnaik identifies. In the meantime, we can start by setting the story straight. We need to recognise that Britain retained control of India not out of benevolence but for the sake of plunder and that Britain's industrial rise didn't emerge sui generis from the steam engine and strong institutions, as our schoolbooks would have it, but depended on violent theft from other lands and other peoples.

24,Staying home: Kerala keeping talent local to grow its economy,Sebastian Castelier,"Kochi, India - Rajeev Chandrasekharan's drone business is ready for take-off. In his sparse, and as yet incomplete, office in the southern Indian state of Kerala, he says he's grateful for the local government's initiative to help startups like his.

""Kerala's startup ecosystem is promising,"" he told Al Jazeera from his company's headquarters in the Integrated Startup Complex. Elsewhere on the site, others are making social media videos and creating software for the hotel industry.

The sprawling facility on the outskirts of the state's commercial capital Kochi is a local government-funded innovation incubator that was inaugurated in January. It's expected to begin full operations in the coming weeks. Once under way, it's slated to be one of the largest startup hubs in India, with 150 companies due to begin operations this year alone.

Not everyone agrees that the state government's approach to luring tech talent is the right one, or that it's making a significant dent in its troublingly high unemployment rate.

But such issues don't seem to be much of a bother for Chandrasekharan. He's the CEO of FeatherDyn, a firm he and two other former aerospace engineers set up in Kerala last year. He says a large global shipping company has already shown an interest in its unmanned drones that are designed to lift heavy equipment used to check cargo ships and oil and gas pipelines.

He's part of a new generation of Keralites who are looking to stay in India to build their careers, rather than follow in the footsteps of previous generations who went abroad, mostly to the Middle East, to find work.

Homeward bound

Between 2013 and 2018, the number of Keralites living overseas fell by around 300,000 to 2.1 million people, according to a survey completed last year by the Centre for Development Studies, a research institute, and commissioned by the Kerala state government. The report says 89 percent of Kerala's emigrants live in Middle Eastern countries in the Gulf.

The largest proportion of those who returned, slightly fewer than a third, did so because they had lost their jobs, either due to programmes in host countries to increase the number of their citizens in the workplace, or companies feeling the pinch of a steep drop in oil prices since 2014.

Kerala relies heavily on foreign remittances. According to Irudaya Rajan, one of the authors of the report, payments sent home from abroad make up a third of the state's income, one of the highest such ratios for any region in the world.

But Kerala is something of an anomaly in India. Nationwide, the number of Indians moving overseas appears to be growing, according to the United Nations. But the reversal in Kerala's migration patterns has forced the state's government to make an aggressive push to create jobs.

The Integrated Startup Complex is a key part of that plan.

The Integrated Startup Complex in Kochi offers Indian entrepreneurs manufacturing facilities, labs and more [Sebastian Castelier/Al Jazeera]

Spread over the equivalent of three American football fields, the complex includes offices, labs, conference rooms and manufacturing facilities.

But the Kerala government also offers startups a loan programme and helps emerging tech firms raise funds by linking them up with venture capitalists and other investors. It also runs mini incubators in 200 colleges across the state to encourage students to enter the technology industry.

Chandrasekharan said he tried looking for similar opportunities in Bengaluru, India's technology capital in the neighbouring state of Karnataka, but ""could not find a place like this"".

Kerala became the first state in India to formulate a comprehensive startup policy in 2014. It aimed to attract investments of $720m, hire international mentors, and send Keralites abroad to learn from more advanced startup markets.

Flawed strategy?

By at least one measure the strategy seems to be working: the number of technology startups in Kerala has tripled to 750 over the last five years, and local authorities expect Kerala to become the number one destination for startups in India by 2020.

""We cannot rely on the financial health of other countries,"" Saji Gopinath, CEO of the Kerala Startup Mission, told Al Jazeera. The body is a state government agency set up to promote entrepreneurship.

But critics of Kerala's plans say the government's strategy for attracting tech entrepreneurs is flawed and has yet to create enough jobs.

""I would not say that it has contributed much to Kerala's economy. We should ask ourselves, what are the results of the Startup Policy?"" Rony Thomas Rajan, assistant professor at the Department of Economics of the University of Kerala, told Al Jazeera.

According to a major economic review published by the Kerala state government in February, its unemployment rate of 12.5 percent between 2015-16 was one of the highest in the country, and more than double the national average of five percent over that period.

And unemployment was a major concern for voters across India during last month's national elections. In a national survey published in March by the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, 19 percent of respondents said it was the single biggest problem the country faces.

Government figures released last Friday showed the country's unemployment rate rose to a multi-year high of 6.1 percent in the 2017-18 fiscal year.

Critics of Kerala's tech startup strategy say it relies too heavily on government support [Sebastian Castelier/Al Jazeera]

Critics of Kerala's startup policy say it relies far too heavily on government support. They point to the thriving technology hubs in Bengaluru, Mumbai and the capital New Delhi which have attracted much higher levels of private investment.

""We have very few private investors,"" Kerala Startup Mission's CEO Gopinath admitted.

'There's a lot happening here'

But for Kerala's budding entrepreneurs, the Integrated Startup Complex is something of a godsend.

Nisha Krishnan recently took up space within the complex to operate a digital video platform, I'm Channel, aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.

""There is a lot happening here; it needs to be reported,"" she told Al Jazeera. Her company has already produced 900 videos on startups, innovation and technology, both in English and the local Malayalam language.

Krishnan says Kerala's entrepreneurs are no longer copying concepts from Silicon Valley, but are charting their own course to address issues faced by their local communities.

Another startup on the site is Instio, which creates software for the local hospitality industry. Its founder, Girish Prabhu, used his own money to launch the company in 2016. He moved to the complex earlier this year and is now planning to use it as a launchpad to expand to Dubai.

He's taking advantage of opportunities in the Middle East, but in a very different way to how his forebears might have done.","""Kerala's startup ecosystem is promising,"" he told Al Jazeera from his company's headquarters in the Integrated Startup Complex.

26,The International Space Station: The next hot tourist destination,Laura Winter,"NASA announced on Friday at the Nasdaq stock exchange that it was opening the International Space Station (ISS) to for-profit activities including marketing, advertising, off-Earth manufacturing - and even tourism.

""We're enabling up to two commercial flights with private astronauts per year,"" said NASA's ISS Deputy Director, Robyn Gatens. ""So, depending on how many seats they want to carry, that would be a dozen or so private astronauts potentially per year on the International Space Station.""

NASA is 'unleashing US industry on the path to a commercial economy in low-Earth orbit' [NASA]

Gatens later added, ""private astronauts from other countries can fly through a US entity"". That means ISS passenger-guests do not need to hold a US passport or hail from a space-faring nation. They do need to book their training, their ride and their up-to-30-day stay through an American space carrier.

Big picture, space B&B really is just a first step in what NASA calls the ""unleashing US industry on the path to a commercial economy in low-Earth orbit"" (LEO, defined as up to 2,000km above the Earth's surface).

Tourism and other ISS commercial endeavours are collectively just a piece of a 30-page policy - entitled NASA's Plan for Commercial LEO Development - that was released on Friday.

NASA wants to see established commercial entities and entrepreneurs grow into being much more responsible for LEO activities, including eventually building and maintaining next-generation-of-space platforms that provide similar research services and capabilities to those found on the ISS. In fact, NASA wants to become a future customer.

Commercial interests

Sierra Nevada Corp is one such commercial interest that is actively testing its multi-mission space utility vehicle, Dream Chaser. This vehicle is similar to NASA's now-retired space shuttle in that it can be sent up by rocket into LEO, and land on an airstrip upon its return to Earth. However, it should be a more robust vehicle in that it is being designed to be a temporary orbital science laboratory.

The Dream Chaser crew secures the spacecraft after a successful test flight at Edwards Air Force Base, California in 2017 [Ken Ulbrich/NASA via Associated Press]

Steve Lindsey, a former NASA astronaut with more than 30 years of flight-test experience, is the vice president of Space Exploration Systems. He said, ""We're obviously as a company interested in all of these things because ... it's a big reason as to why we are involved in designing Dream Chaser in the first place.""

He later added, ""I think that that commercial-use policy is going to be really key to how open that market is"".

At present, Sierra Nevada is focused on cargo-only missions to LEO destinations. But the design is meant to be developed in the future to carry crew, and the first launch is slated for 2021.

Jeff DeWit, NASA's chief financial officer, told the audience at Nasdaq that what NASA intends to achieve - now with this first step, and in the future - is the ability to free up needed capital and manpower. He said the plan ""will enable NASA to focus resources to land the next man and the first woman on the moon by 2024"".

While the plan seemingly puts space within reach of private citizens and businesses, the current pricing scheme is eye-wateringly expensive. While it will cost $3,000 a kilogramme just to send cargo up to the ISS, the price of life support and toilet facilities is $11,250 per person per day.

Obtaining food, air, medical kits, and access to the onboard gym has a price tag of $22,500 per person per day.

This all begs the question: ""What's going to be NASA's profit?""

DeWit answered, ""This is not going to be a profit-making venture for NASA at all, but it will defray some of our expenses. And the prices we're putting up there are a portion of our expenses to maintain the station. So [this is] just to defray some of our expenses, which we then can use to go further into space and get to Mars.""

NASA is 'unleashing US industry on the path to a commercial economy in low-Earth orbit' [NASA]

Gatens later added, ""private astronauts from other countries can fly through a US entity"". That means ISS passenger-guests do not need to hold a US passport or hail from a space-faring nation. They do need to book their training, their ride and their up-to-30-day stay through an American space carrier.

Big picture, space B&B really is just a first step in what NASA calls the ""unleashing US industry on the path to a commercial economy in low-Earth orbit"" (LEO, defined as up to 2,000km above the Earth's surface).

Tourism and other ISS commercial endeavours are collectively just a piece of a 30-page policy - entitled NASA's Plan for Commercial LEO Development - that was released on Friday.

NASA wants to see established commercial entities and entrepreneurs grow into being much more responsible for LEO activities, including eventually building and maintaining next-generation-of-space platforms that provide similar research services and capabilities to those found on the ISS. In fact, NASA wants to become a future customer.

Commercial interests

Sierra Nevada Corp is one such commercial interest that is actively testing its multi-mission space utility vehicle, Dream Chaser. This vehicle is similar to NASA's now-retired space shuttle in that it can be sent up by rocket into LEO, and land on an airstrip upon its return to Earth. However, it should be a more robust vehicle in that it is being designed to be a temporary orbital science laboratory.

Steve Lindsey, a former NASA astronaut with more than 30 years of flight-test experience, is the vice president of Space Exploration Systems. He said, ""We're obviously as a company interested in all of these things because ... it's a big reason as to why we are involved in designing Dream Chaser in the first place.""

He later added, ""I think that that commercial-use policy is going to be really key to how open that market is"".

28,Reporting from Tiananmen Square in 1989: 'I saw a lot I will never forget',Adrian Brown,"The student-led protests in Beijing had been going on for almost three weeks by the time I arrived in China on May 1, 1989.

In those days, there were far fewer international flights to and from the Chinese capital and so my journey was memorably circuitous. My itinerary was Hong Kong-Tokyo-Shanghai, and from there an 18-hour train journey to Beijing. Today, by the high-speed version, that same trip takes roughly four hours - as good a metaphor as any as to how China has come a long way very quickly.

I got to Beijing - or Peking as some broadcasters still called it - in time to cover a march of more than one million students on May 4. In the warm spring sunshine, the mood seemed festive rather than angry - that would come later.

Prominent among the student leaders was Wu'er Kaixi, a 21-year-old studying education administration at Beijing Normal University.

190603075028075

I remember thinking that he was both arrogant and charismatic, in equal measure. But millions of students hung on to his every word. Today, he remains adamant that the students were not seeking regime change when they began their mass occupation on Tiananmen Square, in the ceremonial heart of the capital

""We were having sit-ins. We were having mass hunger strikes. You do not bring down a government with a hunger strike!"" he tells me during a lengthy interview in Taiwan's capital, Taipei, where he now lives in exile.

""We did not want to bring down the Communist Party. We wanted to hold them accountable. We wanted political reform, freedom of speech and an end to corruption. We believed that the answer is democracy.""

The Chinese government responded by declaring martial law and ordering troops into the square to break up the pro-democracy protests. It has never been revealed how many died in the violent crackdown, but estimates by human rights groups and activists range from a few hundred to thousands.

Adrian Brown reporting from Tiananmen Square in 1989 [Al Jazeera]

In rare comments made on Sunday, China's Defence Minister Wei Fenghe said the protests were ""political turmoil that the central government needed to quell, which was the correct policy"".

He added: ""Due to this, China has enjoyed stability, and if you visit China you can understand that part of history.""

'Never expected live ammunition'

This time three decades ago, Wu'er gained international fame when his face appeared on the cover of Time magazine. In the years that followed, he has been a businessman, broadcaster and human rights campaigner. When it comes to China, he wants to remain relevant

I remind him of the night when state TV broadcast images of a hunger-striking Wu'er meeting Li Peng, the man who would later become China's premier and who played a key role in the brutal crackdown. The setting was the Great Hall of the People and Wu'er was dressed in hospital pyjamas, wagging an admonishing finger in Li's face.

It's a scene unlikely to recur in my lifetime.

""A lot of people still remember the hospital gown, the gesture I put and probably I was a little agitated but I was on the fifth day of a hunger strike and there were hundreds outside doing the same,"" Wu'er recalls.

He says they were typical students who believed their movement would bring change - not the carnage of June 4. After the declaration of martial law in late May, some students had begun to worry. But they never imagined their peaceful actions would end the way they did.

""We expected some bloodshed, to be hit by police batons, perhaps. That's what we had expected. Live ammunition? No. Never,"" Wu'er says.

June 4

I held a similar belief, and that was one of the reasons I and many others had left Beijing on May 28, convinced that the protest movement was petering out.

I returned early on the morning of June 4.

190602232721328

Along the old road from Beijing airport into the city - long since replaced by an eight-lane highway - was an almost unbroken line of tanks and troop carriers. My taxi wove its way through barricades of abandoned buses, a forlorn effort to try to impede the progress of the world's biggest army.

By mid-afternoon, under heavy grey skies, I and two colleagues were making our way along Chang'an Avenue, which ironically translates into English as the Avenue of Eternal Peace.

This is the thoroughfare that passes through the centre of Beijing and Tiananmen Square. Just a week earlier, thousands of protesters were still camping there. But the flags, bunting and a 10-metre-high statue of the Goddess of Democracy were now gone. In their place were thousands of soldiers, many of them forming a human barricade to block all access to the square, into which large troop-carrying helicopters were bringing additional reinforcements.

The army was in control. But these soldiers were not from the Beijing garrison, they from other provinces and had been told that an occupying force had taken over. Incredibly, a few men and women stood within a few metres of one army barricade hurling insults at the soldiers - gestures of defiance that were met with warning shots.

I saw a lot that day that I will never forget. A tank treading on two flattened bodies, a burned-out army personnel carrier and the charred corpse of a soldier inside.

The anger among many ordinary people was still palpable.

Estimates by human rights groups on the number of people killed range from a few hundred to thousands [File: Jeff Widener/AP]

Fleeing China

On the other side of the city, Wu'er was in hospital being treated for heart palpitations. He'd been there several days earlier when he was summoned to meet Li Peng.

On the night of June 3, he knew something terrible had happened when bodies began to be wheeled in.

""The floor of the ER was covered by blood so the casualty must be very high. In the hospital, you can smell the blood. You can see the people are dying next to you.""

He says the nurses knew who he was and the danger he was now in. But the nurses and doctors did not betray him.

""They put me in the infectious disease ward. They believed it was a safer place. The PLA [People's Liberation Army] soldiers wouldn't go in there. But that place didn't seem to be that safe afterwards so they moved me.""

Wu'er was eventually smuggled out of Beijing, making it to the southern city of Zhuhai from where he was spirited to Hong Kong by sympathisers.

Covering the crackdown

Back in Beijing, the job of being a foreign correspondent had become all but impossible. In once welcoming neighbourhoods - or hutongs - people no longer wanted to talk to us.

190426023911794

One night, a chilling report aired on the 7pm evening news. It showed the arrest of a man who had been wanted after talking to a TV news network from the United States.

The night before, the same news programme had shown a clip of him denouncing China's government over the bloodshed - turn him in was the message.

Unable to broadcast our reports from China, we had to find people at the airport - mostly fleeing foreigners - willing to carry our cassettes to Hong Kong by hand. From there they could be beamed by satellite to anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, the Chinese authorities found a way to get a split of these feeds and download them into China. That's how the authorities got their man - and many others like him.

'Deploying fear'

Wu'er Kaixi: 'Fear is very, very present in China' [File: Wally Santana/AP]

Wu'er says he wants to return to China and stand trial on whatever charge the government wants to bring against him. But, of course, he doesn't expect this to ever happen.

He also concedes that the events of 30 years ago are unlikely to be repeated. A vast security and surveillance network has seen to that.

""Let's not forget the Communist Party has learned a great deal in the past 30 years in how to deploy fear,"" he says.

""Fear is very, very present in China. In 1989, they established that with this massacre, the PLA soldiers. These days it's no longer bloodbath.

32,"Simple, iconic: How I M Pei's Museum of Islamic Art reshaped Qatar",Amira Abujbara,"Growing up, I lived in Umm Slal, a small town on the outskirts of Doha, Qatar's capital city. My bedroom window faced open desert, the rocky ground forming a simple line across the horizon, the faint trace of electricity lines silhouetted against the sun. My favourite time of day was when the sun would set directly into my room, the light filtering through the tinted windows and onto my blue-painted walls.

Ours was a small neighbourhood - a row of cement houses with metal gates, one main street and some stray cats. But that was changing quickly. Take-away restaurants and residential compounds were appearing, rows of houses were being built on once-flat desert. Doha's suburbs were encroaching, rapidly.

Downtown, a glittering skyline was emerging; construction cranes and cement skeletons gave way to metal and glass towers and I could see growing when we drove through the city.

Some of the new buildings gave you vertigo. The Museum of Islamic Art was one of them.

I was in middle school when it was constructed on a man-made island on the south side of Doha's Corniche, a stretch of seafront along which the city is built.

It was designed by I M Pei (1917 - 2019), the Chinese-born architect known for modern designs such as the Louvre pyramid in Paris and the Bank of China tower in Hong Kong. He had been coaxed out of retirement to design it.

The Qatari government's vision for the building was clear: It would be the first and crown jewel of a series of museums in the country.

The MIA museum opened to the public in 2008; it was like nothing the city had seen before.

190516233421853

The building feels otherworldly; its light stone rising from the water 60 metres offshore, its shaded arches dwarfing visitors who pass beneath them, its angled walls casting shadows under the shifting sun.

Yet, it also feels like home; the dry rustle of palm trees along the outdoor walkway, the salty ocean air, the warm stone underfoot, and the building's simple shapes - circles, squares and stars - are familiar to residents of this small Gulf country.

Like many new buildings, it seems to offer a promise for the future while also leaving you contemplating what lay there before.

It is a familiar feeling in a rapidly growing city where the skyline seemed to appear almost overnight.

I wonder now visiting the museum - walking past the white noise of water running down the entrance bridge, through glass doors and into an atrium that feels as simple and bright as the desert itself - why I M Pei, then in his 80s and at the end of his career, had chosen to design it.

I spoke to a number of people who knew him or his work well and they had some ideas why he did: He had never worked in the Middle East before and saw it as a new frontier; he had developed a genuine friendship with our father emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who gave him the freedom to build his masterpiece; he was taken by the vision and drive of a royal family that was putting their money towards preserving the cultural history of the region.

Some of them had met the Pritzker Prize-winning architect - who passed away at the age of 102 last week - and others hadn't. I wish I had, as I walk through the museum and am again reminded of my childhood bedroom, of the sun setting on its walls, of the open desert.

I M Pei had insisted that the museum be built on reclaimed land so that no number of new towers could obstruct the sun.

I M Pei, I see, also loved the Doha light.

Others shared with me their view of the museum and what it means to them.

'A big bang'

The museum has seen its visitors double over the past 10 years, with roughly 500,000 visitors passing through last year, according to museum staff [Courtesy: Marc Pelletreau/The Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]

Julia Gonnella, director of the Museum of Islamic Art since 2017, remembers when the museum opened and says its international impact could not be overstated.

""It was a big bang,"" she says, sitting in her brightly lit office overlooking the grounds. A scholar of archaeology and Islamic art, she had been working in Berlin in 2008.

Rather than being devoted to any one region, the museum's collection had objects everywhere from North Africa to the Middle East to the East Asia.

""It's a huge museum and, of course, it was an event because it was the first of these sort of mega-museums in the Gulf,"" she says.

Of all the items in its collection - from beautiful metalwork to intricate carpets and vases - the building itself was the most remarkable.

""It became the iconic landmark and I think it will remain the iconic landmark because of its superb location here.""

'In the middle of the sea'

Shamsudeen Nalakath Paduvingal is in Qatar on a business trip and decided to stop by the museum.

He sits on a white couch in the atrium, facing a window overlooking the ocean and Doha's skyline.

""It is a very special building … you can feel it is in the middle of the sea,"" he says with a soft laugh.

Unlike a number of tourists visiting that day, Paduvingal considers Qatar his second home. He lived here for 20 years before moving home to Kerala, India six years ago. The visit is bringing back memories.

""Sitting here and seeing all these things, I am really feeling that nostalgia when I was moving here in Qatar and living with my family ... I've never seen such kind of a good place in my life.""

I thought of having some time here with my past memories. Shamsudeen Nalakath Paduvingal

The city is developing quicker than he ever imagined, he says, remembering Doha in the 1990s, before the construction boom.

For him, it was a simple, more relaxed time, and he describes manageable working hours, close relationships with Qataris, and time spent with family and friends.

Paduvingal sees a city that is busier and more bustling now, and while he misses the old Doha, he sees what it has become as a step forward.

""Modern living it is required. It is very much required and Doha is developing ... and the people are getting better standards [of living].""

Paduvingal says he hopes to be able to move back to Doha. His children, now grown and living abroad, want him to do that so they can move back too.

For now, the museum gives him space to reflect. ""I am staying in a nearby hotel and I thought of having some time here with my past memories.""

'The essence of Islam'

Sara Al Sada, a young Qatari architect, was completely taken by the museum and what it represented when she first visited it.

""I was obsessed by the beauty of the building ... the architecture, the details of the interior,"" she says. ""But then I start asking myself, 'OK, I appreciate the building but what is the Islamic part of it …? Is it arcades, is it the fountain courtyard, is it the chandelier in the middle of the atrium? What is it exactly? Or is it a collection of all of these?'""

Al Sada wanted to learn more about the Islamic influences in the building, so she read about I M Pei and his travels around the Islamic world to learn about its architecture, seeking its ""essence"".

He was inspired by the famous Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo but chose to reflect the spirit of Islamic architecture - which always seeks simplicity - rather than any one design element.

""He captured it very deeply,"" Al Sada reflects.

In her own work, she is inspired by I M Pei's use of natural light and ventilation and believes buildings like these can inspire other young architects in Qatar to use the environment around them while creating multi-use public spaces that impact public thinking.

""[An] architect is ... responsible for bringing the society back, designing their lives,"" she says.

""We can build a totally new society through architecture, a totally different mind also."" The museum addresses one of Doha's urban planning challenges, that of creating enough public spaces, something Al Sada has focused on since graduating in 2017.

The interior has a spacious atrium cafe where people gather while the expansive grounds offer more areas where families and groups of friends can stroll, lounge on the grass, or play with their children.

""Relating culture, art, and public spaces is also a very important step in the country … I'm learning a lot from this and trying to develop it,"" Al Sada explains.

For her, I M Pei's design, and the effort to bring the museum alive, honours Qatar's history without being stuck in the past.

""Bringing back these elements in a totally new and different style will always remind you that your past can always be with you from your point of view,"" she says.

'It's an artwork'

Shaika Nasser Al-Nassr, the deputy director of curatorial affairs, has been with the museum since the beginning.

She remembers working in off-site storage before the building was completed, pushing to get the museum off the ground. ""After we left our abayas were full of dust,"" she says of the traditional Qatari garb with a laugh.

Eleven years later, she is fully settled in. Al-Nassr oversees the museum's exhibitions and digital projects, as well as the conservation and registration of objects.

She and her team work to put on exhibitions that are relevant to residents and visitors, such as the recent Syria Matters exhibition.

It looked at Syria's cultural heritage, and attracted 110,000 visitors, according to the museum's director. Part of its draw, Al-Nasser thinks, was its relevance in politics and life today.

Al-Nassr believes the museum's location in the Middle East is key, and says she never tires of the collection, which she believes is the first of its kind.

""I think ... it's like you are putting the objects into context,"" she says. ""It's in the region, it's where the Islamic arts in the Arabian Peninsula really started … and spread around the world.""

When you see the objects, they … really have high, high techniques, but they are simple at the same time, which kind of reflects our belief and religion. Shaika Nasser Al-Nassr

The artwork also reflects the religion, she says, and the message it carries is something she can pass down to her children, as can visitors.

""When you see the objects, they … really have high, high techniques, but they are simple at the same time, which kind of reflects our belief and religion, which is simplicity,"" she says.

The artists could have created lavish works, she says, ""but no, it's so beautiful and so simple … and this reflects our beliefs, like you have to be humble"".

""I've been to many international museums and especially Islamic art galleries. I don't think I've seen such a museum that really tells the story of Islamic art, history in such a way and in-depth.""","The Museum of Islamic Art was one of them.

33,"Simple, iconic: How I M Pei's Museum of Islamic Art reshaped Qatar",About The Author,"Growing up, I lived in Umm Slal, a small town on the outskirts of Doha, Qatar's capital city. My bedroom window faced open desert, the rocky ground forming a simple line across the horizon, the faint trace of electricity lines silhouetted against the sun. My favourite time of day was when the sun would set directly into my room, the light filtering through the tinted windows and onto my blue-painted walls.

Ours was a small neighbourhood - a row of cement houses with metal gates, one main street and some stray cats. But that was changing quickly. Take-away restaurants and residential compounds were appearing, rows of houses were being built on once-flat desert. Doha's suburbs were encroaching, rapidly.

Downtown, a glittering skyline was emerging; construction cranes and cement skeletons gave way to metal and glass towers and I could see growing when we drove through the city.

35,"Simple, iconic: How I M Pei's Museum of Islamic Art reshaped Qatar",Based In Doha.,"Growing up, I lived in Umm Slal, a small town on the outskirts of Doha, Qatar's capital city. My bedroom window faced open desert, the rocky ground forming a simple line across the horizon, the faint trace of electricity lines silhouetted against the sun. My favourite time of day was when the sun would set directly into my room, the light filtering through the tinted windows and onto my blue-painted walls.

Ours was a small neighbourhood - a row of cement houses with metal gates, one main street and some stray cats. But that was changing quickly. Take-away restaurants and residential compounds were appearing, rows of houses were being built on once-flat desert. Doha's suburbs were encroaching, rapidly.

Downtown, a glittering skyline was emerging; construction cranes and cement skeletons gave way to metal and glass towers and I could see growing when we drove through the city.

Some of the new buildings gave you vertigo. The Museum of Islamic Art was one of them.

I was in middle school when it was constructed on a man-made island on the south side of Doha's Corniche, a stretch of seafront along which the city is built.

It was designed by I M Pei (1917 - 2019), the Chinese-born architect known for modern designs such as the Louvre pyramid in Paris and the Bank of China tower in Hong Kong. He had been coaxed out of retirement to design it.

The Qatari government's vision for the building was clear: It would be the first and crown jewel of a series of museums in the country.

The MIA museum opened to the public in 2008; it was like nothing the city had seen before.

190516233421853

The building feels otherworldly; its light stone rising from the water 60 metres offshore, its shaded arches dwarfing visitors who pass beneath them, its angled walls casting shadows under the shifting sun.

Yet, it also feels like home; the dry rustle of palm trees along the outdoor walkway, the salty ocean air, the warm stone underfoot, and the building's simple shapes - circles, squares and stars - are familiar to residents of this small Gulf country.

Like many new buildings, it seems to offer a promise for the future while also leaving you contemplating what lay there before.

It is a familiar feeling in a rapidly growing city where the skyline seemed to appear almost overnight.

I wonder now visiting the museum - walking past the white noise of water running down the entrance bridge, through glass doors and into an atrium that feels as simple and bright as the desert itself - why I M Pei, then in his 80s and at the end of his career, had chosen to design it.

I spoke to a number of people who knew him or his work well and they had some ideas why he did: He had never worked in the Middle East before and saw it as a new frontier; he had developed a genuine friendship with our father emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who gave him the freedom to build his masterpiece; he was taken by the vision and drive of a royal family that was putting their money towards preserving the cultural history of the region.

Some of them had met the Pritzker Prize-winning architect - who passed away at the age of 102 last week - and others hadn't. I wish I had, as I walk through the museum and am again reminded of my childhood bedroom, of the sun setting on its walls, of the open desert.

I M Pei had insisted that the museum be built on reclaimed land so that no number of new towers could obstruct the sun.

I M Pei, I see, also loved the Doha light.

Others shared with me their view of the museum and what it means to them.

'A big bang'

The museum has seen its visitors double over the past 10 years, with roughly 500,000 visitors passing through last year, according to museum staff [Courtesy: Marc Pelletreau/The Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]

Julia Gonnella, director of the Museum of Islamic Art since 2017, remembers when the museum opened and says its international impact could not be overstated.

""It was a big bang,"" she says, sitting in her brightly lit office overlooking the grounds. A scholar of archaeology and Islamic art, she had been working in Berlin in 2008.

Rather than being devoted to any one region, the museum's collection had objects everywhere from North Africa to the Middle East to the East Asia.

""It's a huge museum and, of course, it was an event because it was the first of these sort of mega-museums in the Gulf,"" she says.

Of all the items in its collection - from beautiful metalwork to intricate carpets and vases - the building itself was the most remarkable.

""It became the iconic landmark and I think it will remain the iconic landmark because of its superb location here.""

'In the middle of the sea'

Shamsudeen Nalakath Paduvingal is in Qatar on a business trip and decided to stop by the museum.

He sits on a white couch in the atrium, facing a window overlooking the ocean and Doha's skyline.

""It is a very special building … you can feel it is in the middle of the sea,"" he says with a soft laugh.

Unlike a number of tourists visiting that day, Paduvingal considers Qatar his second home. He lived here for 20 years before moving home to Kerala, India six years ago. The visit is bringing back memories.

""Sitting here and seeing all these things, I am really feeling that nostalgia when I was moving here in Qatar and living with my family ... I've never seen such kind of a good place in my life.""

I thought of having some time here with my past memories. Shamsudeen Nalakath Paduvingal

The city is developing quicker than he ever imagined, he says, remembering Doha in the 1990s, before the construction boom.

For him, it was a simple, more relaxed time, and he describes manageable working hours, close relationships with Qataris, and time spent with family and friends.

Paduvingal sees a city that is busier and more bustling now, and while he misses the old Doha, he sees what it has become as a step forward.

""Modern living it is required. It is very much required and Doha is developing ... and the people are getting better standards [of living].""

Paduvingal says he hopes to be able to move back to Doha. His children, now grown and living abroad, want him to do that so they can move back too.

For now, the museum gives him space to reflect. ""I am staying in a nearby hotel and I thought of having some time here with my past memories.""

'The essence of Islam'

Sara Al Sada, a young Qatari architect, was completely taken by the museum and what it represented when she first visited it.

""I was obsessed by the beauty of the building ... the architecture, the details of the interior,"" she says. ""But then I start asking myself, 'OK, I appreciate the building but what is the Islamic part of it …? Is it arcades, is it the fountain courtyard, is it the chandelier in the middle of the atrium? What is it exactly? Or is it a collection of all of these?'""

Al Sada wanted to learn more about the Islamic influences in the building, so she read about I M Pei and his travels around the Islamic world to learn about its architecture, seeking its ""essence"".

He was inspired by the famous Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo but chose to reflect the spirit of Islamic architecture - which always seeks simplicity - rather than any one design element.

""He captured it very deeply,"" Al Sada reflects.

In her own work, she is inspired by I M Pei's use of natural light and ventilation and believes buildings like these can inspire other young architects in Qatar to use the environment around them while creating multi-use public spaces that impact public thinking.

""[An] architect is ... responsible for bringing the society back, designing their lives,"" she says.

""We can build a totally new society through architecture, a totally different mind also."" The museum addresses one of Doha's urban planning challenges, that of creating enough public spaces, something Al Sada has focused on since graduating in 2017.

The interior has a spacious atrium cafe where people gather while the expansive grounds offer more areas where families and groups of friends can stroll, lounge on the grass, or play with their children.

""Relating culture, art, and public spaces is also a very important step in the country … I'm learning a lot from this and trying to develop it,"" Al Sada explains.

For her, I M Pei's design, and the effort to bring the museum alive, honours Qatar's history without being stuck in the past.

""Bringing back these elements in a totally new and different style will always remind you that your past can always be with you from your point of view,"" she says.

'It's an artwork'

The museum's architect, I M Pei, passed away at the age of 102 in his New York City home [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera]

Shaika Nasser Al-Nassr, the deputy director of curatorial affairs, has been with the museum since the beginning.

She remembers working in off-site storage before the building was completed, pushing to get the museum off the ground. ""After we left our abayas were full of dust,"" she says of the traditional Qatari garb with a laugh.

Eleven years later, she is fully settled in. Al-Nassr oversees the museum's exhibitions and digital projects, as well as the conservation and registration of objects.

She and her team work to put on exhibitions that are relevant to residents and visitors, such as the recent Syria Matters exhibition.

It looked at Syria's cultural heritage, and attracted 110,000 visitors, according to the museum's director. Part of its draw, Al-Nasser thinks, was its relevance in politics and life today.

Al-Nassr believes the museum's location in the Middle East is key, and says she never tires of the collection, which she believes is the first of its kind.

""I think ... it's like you are putting the objects into context,"" she says. ""It's in the region, it's where the Islamic arts in the Arabian Peninsula really started … and spread around the world.""

When you see the objects, they … really have high, high techniques, but they are simple at the same time, which kind of reflects our belief and religion. Shaika Nasser Al-Nassr

The artwork also reflects the religion, she says, and the message it carries is something she can pass down to her children, as can visitors.

""When you see the objects, they … really have high, high techniques, but they are simple at the same time, which kind of reflects our belief and religion, which is simplicity,"" she says.

The artists could have created lavish works, she says, ""but no, it's so beautiful and so simple … and this reflects our beliefs, like you have to be humble"".

36,Juana's story: Seeking sanctuary in a US church,Pilar Timpane,"Two years since Juana Luz Tobar Ortega sought sanctuary in an attempt to avoid deportation from the United States, there is still no end in sight to her ordeal. In fact, the world outside has become even more dangerous for her and other migrants trapped in a similar situation.

Originally from Guatemala, the 47-year-old mother-of-four took sanctuary at St Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2017. In the years since she has spent her time sewing pillows and other items as a way to raise funds and pass the monotonous days. She puts the number at possibly 1,000 pillows and several hundred bags.

""Before [seeking sanctuary], I had a secure job. I sewed and made a salary,"" she says. ""But now being in sanctuary it's a complete change. I used to work 40 hours a week.""

Juana first migrated to the US after fleeing violence in Guatemala over 25 years ago. Although her formal asylum claim was denied, she says Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) allowed her to stay in the US and work for many years, while they did routine check-ins. Then in May 2017, she was told she had to leave the country, and Juana and her family were forced to make an impossible decision.

Through the social justice organisation, American Friends Service Committee of North Carolina, Juana's oldest daughter Lesvi Molina connected with St Barnabas and brought her mother there to learn about the possibility of sanctuary. They were immediately welcoming.

A few months earlier, Reverend Randall Keeney and the vestry of St Barnabas had decided that if someone needed sanctuary, they would fashion an apartment-type space in their fellowship building.

So Juana and her family decided that she would move into St Barnabas - some 80km from the home she and her husband Carlos have shared - to avoid being deported from a country she has known for more than 25 years.

Juana relocated her belongings to the small room in the cinderblock building that became both her refuge and at the same time, an isolating enclosure, as she is not allowed to work or travel.

When Juana entered the church in 2017, she was the first person to publicly take sanctuary in North Carolina in the contemporary movement (prior to this wave of sanctuary cases, a movement had begun in the 1980s in Tuscon, Arizona to shelter undocumented immigrants from deportation).

Others took sanctuary after her, each seeking to avoid deportation. But each sanctuary case is different, involving various legal outcomes.

Minerva Cisneros Garcia, who took sanctuary at a different church in Greensboro, was given a stay of deportation just 100 days after she entered and - in one of the most positive turns since the movement began - was recently granted residency by a federal judge. In Durham, a man named Samuel Oliver-Bruno was violently arrested and held at an ICE biometrics appointment almost one year after taking sanctuary. Jose Chicas, Rosa Ortez Cruz, and Eliseo Jimenez have all remained in sanctuary in North Carolina without any change to their statuses.

Around the US, and in European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, sanctuary and church asylum have seen a resurgence, and sanctuary cases appear to be on the rise. The Church World Service estimates there are close to 50 people in sanctuary (including families with children) in the US today and hundreds of congregations committed to supporting sanctuary in various forms.

For Juana and her family, the two years that she has been in sanctuary have been painful and challenging. ""The worst part,"" she says, ""is not being able to go to my house. When my family has to go home and when they leave, I stay here.""

Juana's family and community have taken her situation very seriously. Many have written letters, knocked on Members of Congress's doors, and engaged in social action campaigns publicly requesting that their local legislators (including Republican Congressman Mark Walker, Senator Thom Tillis, and Senator Richard Burr) take steps to help Juana get her freedom and return home. Group activism has been tried to support collective sanctuary bills and movements. These requests and actions have been continually ignored.

""Sanctuary already is family separation,"" says Lesvi, Juana's daughter, who has taken up a lot of the advocacy for her mom over the past years. In sanctuary, Juana is not able to go to major events in her family's life. The immigration system has quite literally ripped her family apart.

""My husband is a citizen, my two children are citizens, my other two daughters have DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and I am the only one left out. My daughter Jackie is going to graduate from college this year. I can't go out and she wants me to be there that day. But I have to tell her I can't go. She is sad because I can't be there at her graduation.""

In the two years since Juana took sanctuary, North Carolina - perhaps the entire country - has become a less protected place people living and working without documentation in the US.

On a national level, the Trump administration has taken steps to close borders, ban religious and ethnic minorities from entering the country, reverse the decades-long Temporary Protected Status for some immigrants, and regularly threatens DACA.

In North Carolina, many ""anti-sanctuary city"" bills, like the recent HB 370, have been pushed, which would require sheriffs and law enforcement to work with ICE to arrest and deport immigrants. Recently in Juana's family's backyard, huge raids have led to the arrests of many undocumented people and were suspected by many activists to be ""retaliatory"" against ""sanctuary"" policies.

All of these are symbols of what has been shifting in immigration policy, however flimsy, towards rescinding prosecutorial discretion, a practice that had essentially limited non-criminal deportations. While ICE continues to respect the memo on sensitive locations that keeps law enforcement at bay from protected spaces like churches and other spaces of worship, this doesn't change the threat outside the church walls, or provide pathways for citizenship for those in sanctuary.

For two years our film team has followed Juana's progress, producing the short documentary Santuario, codirected by Christine Delp and Pilar Timpane, and bringing her story to audiences around the country. Juana and her family's fight is ongoing.

""We're not asking a lot. We're asking for an opportunity, a work permit, or residency would be the best thing,"" Juana says. ""We'd be able to be at peace.""

39,Venezuela: Where's the petrol?,Lucia Newman,"For the last five years, Venezuelans have been struggling to live with an increasing shortage of food, medicine, electricity and water.

An unprecedented economic crisis and, more recently, the severe US economic sanctions aimed at forcing out President Nicolas Maduro have paralysed public service.

With hyperinflation running at over one million percent and counting, feeding a family on an average salary has become almost impossible.

One of the very few things that Venezuelans could afford was petrol because it literally cost nothing. A litre of petrol cost $0.000001. But now, even filling one's car with the fuel has suddenly become an uphill battle for millions of Venezuelans.

Just two hours northwest of the capital, Caracas, you get the first glimpse of a crisis that is spreading.

In the state of Aragua, thousands of car owners spent Sunday in queues that were kilometres long.

""I was in the line yesterday for four hours and did not get a drop. I hope I'll be luckier today,"" said Leonardo Lopez as he waited in the heat for the queue to inch forward.

He pulled out his mobile phone to show that he and his friends had a group chat called 'Aragua Where Is The Gasoline' so they let each other know which petrol station still had fuel to sell.

'Collective catastrophe'

Further west, the shortages are more acute, especially in the states of Carabobo and even Zulia, which is supposed to be Venezuela's oil capital.

And in the border state of Tachira, where for months residents have been queueing for days to fill up their car tanks.

""The shortages are now collective catastrophe,"" according to State Governor Laidy Gomez.

""The losses are incalculable to the agriculture sector; paralysed and the limitations for mobilising health emergencies are generating crimes against humanity,"" she said on Twitter on Saturday.

Carabobo Governor Rafael Lacava appealed to motorists to remain calm and not let ""media chaos laboratories"" make them nervous.

Harsh US economic sanctions that have specifically targeted Venezuela's vital oil industry are punishing the already decrepit state-owned petroleum and natural petrol company, PDVSA.

""We are refining at only 20 percent of our installed capacity. In other words, our maximum capacity is 1.3 million barrels a day, but we are only managing to refine 260,000 barrels,"" said Alfredo Quiroz, an oil industry expert.

""That is not enough for Venezuela's five million vehicles. So that means we are having to import gasoline [petrol] to make up for the shortfall.""

'Bigger problem'

Until now, Venezuela had been buying petrol from the US. But as of April 28, US government sanctions forbidding fuel sales to PDVSA kicked in.

According to Quiroz, the government has signed a 90-day contract to buy petrol from Spain's oil company REPSOL, in exchange for oil, which for now is being provided by Russia's energy giant ROSNEFT.

""But we have another bigger problem,"" said Quiroz. ""The US will no longer sell Venezuela the additives needed to make gasoline at home and they are much harder to find on the world market.

""Mexico's PEMEX does not have any for sale. Most other companies have already committed their additives too.""

The additives are chemical derivatives of oil, which Venezuela used to produce in abundance. But while the country boasts the world's largest oil reserves, its state-owned industry is in decay. Most of the plants that used to make the components are paralysed.

The refineries need constant maintenance and some have not received it for years, according to industry insiders.

Venezuela's lifeline is its oil industry, which accounts for more than 90 percent of the country's export earnings.

For the last 20 years, PDVSA's production has been steadily declining from 3.36 million barrels a day in 1998 to approximately 727,000 barrels now.

While the price of its heavy crude was at nearly $100 a barrel, the effect was not so easily perceived. But when it fell to less than $50 a barrel in 2013, Venezuela's economy quickly began to crash.

Maduro claims that the subsequent hyperinflation, widespread shortages of basic goods and general collapse of the economy are the fallout from an economic war waged by his domestic and foreign enemies, mainly the US.

Opinion polls suggest the majority of Venezuelans blame his government for incompetence and widespread corruption.

The reasons may be the subject of heated debate, but what no one can question is that the current fuel shortage adds yet another layer to the already heavy burden of living in Venezuela.","One of the very few things that Venezuelans could afford was petrol because it literally cost nothing.

42,Saving Australia's Wombats,Drew Ambrose,"In the southern Australian state of Tasmania, Bea Mayne is on the hunt for wombats.

She wants to find their burrows so that she can help those suffering from an agonising disease - sarcoptic mange, a contagious affliction that can result in a painful death for wombats.

""We've seen them disappear in their hundreds, just in this area,"" Bea says. ""If we see one that's died, and we often do that, it's just heartbreaking.""

In nearby Narawntapu National Park, wombat numbers plunged by 94 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to government figures. The state used to promote the national park as a prime place for tourists to see one of Australia's most loved native animals, but now wombat pictures have been removed from tourism brochures.

Mayne works with a group of volunteers trying to treat wombats suffering from mange across the island.

The volunteers install a plastic flap across the entrance to wombat burrows, which tips a dose of Cydectine, a chemical used to treat sheep lice, on the animal's back. The government says that overall wombat numbers are not declining in Tasmania, and that Narawntapu National Park is an isolated case.

But wildlife campaigners and government representatives agree a more effective treatment is needed.

""For any wombat affected by mange, it's an animal welfare issue,"" says Rosemary Gales, a biodiversity expert who works with the government department responsible for mange control.

""It's a terrible thing to see an animal so severely afflicted by mange and so that's a real priority - to try and find an effective treatment. We need a drug that doesn't have to be applied as often, for as long.""

'The most animal suffering of any disease'

At the University of Tasmania, wildlife ecology expert Dr Scott Carver is trying a new treatment with a drug called Fluralaner.

He says mange causes ""perhaps the most animal suffering of any disease I've worked with"".

Caused by microscopic mites that bury down into the animal's skin, mange makes wombats itch uncontrollably. Wombats scratch until their skin cracks, bleeds and crusts. Their eyes and ears often close over.

The mites that cause mange thrive in the cool and humid environment of a wombat's burrow.

Concerns about wombats are not confined to Tasmania.

Donna Stephan runs one of the country's largest wombat sanctuaries near the Australian capital, Canberra, called Sleepy Burrows. She has been rescuing injured and orphaned wombats for the past 15 years. Stephan says she has seen a dramatic increase in mange cases over that time.

""Ten years ago I could have given you mange-free areas that we looked to release (wombats) in. I could not do that now for you,"" she says.

At Sleepy Burrows, Stephan and Marcus Foth, a design professor at the Queensland University of Technology, are trialling an alternative treatment method for mange.

They have created ""burrow hospitals"" which sit on top of real wombat burrows. As the wombat comes up to feed, a carer can administer an oral treatment for mange once a week.

In the long-term, Donna says, the real problem is the stress placed on wombats from humans, such as habitat destruction and those hit by cars. This stress leads to a suppressed immune system, which makes them more susceptible to mange infections.

Stephan's sanctuary receives more than 300 injured and orphaned wombats a year. Many are babies whose mothers were killed on roads.

The youngest wombats live in Stephan's house with her family.

""The idea was not to have them in the house. It was to keep it separate, but the sanctuary's just grown to a point now that it's not possible,"" she says.

Stephan is pessimistic about the future of the species.

""They’ll be on the critically endangered list within 20 years - no doubt in my mind,"" she says.","In the southern Australian state of Tasmania, Bea Mayne is on the hunt for wombats.

46,Saving Australia's Wombats,Correspondent For East,"In the southern Australian state of Tasmania, Bea Mayne is on the hunt for wombats.

She wants to find their burrows so that she can help those suffering from an agonising disease - sarcoptic mange, a contagious affliction that can result in a painful death for wombats.

""We've seen them disappear in their hundreds, just in this area,"" Bea says. ""If we see one that's died, and we often do that, it's just heartbreaking.""

In nearby Narawntapu National Park, wombat numbers plunged by 94 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to government figures. The state used to promote the national park as a prime place for tourists to see one of Australia's most loved native animals, but now wombat pictures have been removed from tourism brochures.

Mayne works with a group of volunteers trying to treat wombats suffering from mange across the island.

The volunteers install a plastic flap across the entrance to wombat burrows, which tips a dose of Cydectine, a chemical used to treat sheep lice, on the animal's back. The government says that overall wombat numbers are not declining in Tasmania, and that Narawntapu National Park is an isolated case.

But wildlife campaigners and government representatives agree a more effective treatment is needed.

""For any wombat affected by mange, it's an animal welfare issue,"" says Rosemary Gales, a biodiversity expert who works with the government department responsible for mange control.

""It's a terrible thing to see an animal so severely afflicted by mange and so that's a real priority - to try and find an effective treatment. We need a drug that doesn't have to be applied as often, for as long.""

'The most animal suffering of any disease'

At the University of Tasmania, wildlife ecology expert Dr Scott Carver is trying a new treatment with a drug called Fluralaner.

He says mange causes ""perhaps the most animal suffering of any disease I've worked with"".

Caused by microscopic mites that bury down into the animal's skin, mange makes wombats itch uncontrollably. Wombats scratch until their skin cracks, bleeds and crusts. Their eyes and ears often close over.

The mites that cause mange thrive in the cool and humid environment of a wombat's burrow.

Concerns about wombats are not confined to Tasmania.

Donna Stephan runs one of the country's largest wombat sanctuaries near the Australian capital, Canberra, called Sleepy Burrows. She has been rescuing injured and orphaned wombats for the past 15 years. Stephan says she has seen a dramatic increase in mange cases over that time.

""Ten years ago I could have given you mange-free areas that we looked to release (wombats) in. I could not do that now for you,"" she says.

At Sleepy Burrows, Stephan and Marcus Foth, a design professor at the Queensland University of Technology, are trialling an alternative treatment method for mange.

They have created ""burrow hospitals"" which sit on top of real wombat burrows. As the wombat comes up to feed, a carer can administer an oral treatment for mange once a week.

In the long-term, Donna says, the real problem is the stress placed on wombats from humans, such as habitat destruction and those hit by cars. This stress leads to a suppressed immune system, which makes them more susceptible to mange infections.

Stephan's sanctuary receives more than 300 injured and orphaned wombats a year. Many are babies whose mothers were killed on roads.

The youngest wombats live in Stephan's house with her family.

""The idea was not to have them in the house. It was to keep it separate, but the sanctuary's just grown to a point now that it's not possible,"" she says.

Stephan is pessimistic about the future of the species.

""They’ll be on the critically endangered list within 20 years - no doubt in my mind,"" she says.","In the southern Australian state of Tasmania, Bea Mayne is on the hunt for wombats.

48,#FeesMustFall: How student movements shaped a new South Africa,Rehad Desai,"I spent the first 23 years of my life in exile.

My family was forced to leave South Africa in 1963 when I was six months old; my father was a leading figure in South Africa's liberation movement and following the arrest of Nelson Mandela he was ordered to flee the country by his comrades. We were forced to resettle in the UK.

Growing up in England, I had no memory of my home country, having left so young. But I remember it being engrained in me that we were not English, we were South African; and that in a few years' time we would be going home. But those few years were continually extended.

Not being able to return home was a matter of great pain to my parents and older siblings. I grew up in a house with lots of depression, tears and sadness brought on by exile.

But it did not stop my father from continuing his work from afar.

Our home became the centre of a political movement.

In the early 1970s, we often had black student radicals pass through. By 1976, when I was 13 years old, my father was a leading member of the Pan Africanist Congress, which helped build the school student movement that erupted in Soweto that year.

Our house was busy, noisy and full of argument and debate. At times, there was very real anger and anguish, and emotions were particularly heightened when we received news of assassinations from home.

My father's political affiliations, of course, had a profound impact on my own political views. I was close to him and he was a big role model for me. His expectation was that I would join the liberation movement at the age of 16.

I did commit myself while still a school student, which meant fighting from where I was in the UK. I found myself - at the age of 16 - becoming the full-time chairperson of the National Union of School Students. I was in many ways English and realised resistance took on many forms. We were campaigning for a free and equal South Africa and supporting other causes, but our fight focused on everyday issues such as corporal punishment, school uniforms and the right to organise.

Return to South Africa

Sometime later and two years into my university education in London, South Africa was on fire again and I was occupying banks and supermarkets as part of the local anti-apartheid campaign.

By 1990, the white regime was forced to make reforms that allowed exiles like ourselves to return home legally. I was in Zimbabwe at the time, where I had enrolled to finish my studies because I wanted to be closer to home.

My father and I were among the first to go back.

Returning home was extremely exhilarating. I remember arriving in Cape Town and crying about how beautiful my country and town of birth was. We arrived two days before Nelson Mandela was released and I went into town to hear him address the crowds.

It was moving but very chaotic and violent. Fighting broke out between the police and township youth during his speech. I arrived home drenched in the blood of people that I had carried to ambulances.

The frenzy was counteracted by the very heartening response we received; everywhere we went announcements were made that ""we have returning exiles in our midst,"" and we were applauded and lighters were ignited. It was quite overwhelming.

Following the defeat of white supremacist rule in 1994, I felt that I could now continue my postgraduate studies and enrolled at Wits University, the story universe of the documentary Everything Must Fall.

Wits was and remains an elite university.

Back then black students were a minority and white liberal universities were still in denial about their racially exclusive culture. I often felt suffocated by the whiteness of the space, in this instance it's Englishness, that had both shaped me since childhood and revolted me.

It could be summed up as ""we might be a former colonial outpost but we can and are at times competing with the best."" That meant a big emphasis on research, often to the detriment of teaching time, sorely needed for many of the black students who had not had a decent high school education to prepare them for university.

It was the typical postcolonial thing, keeping standards up at all costs.

I vividly recall one instance; I was representing the postgraduate student body in the newly established Transformation Council when I heartily objected to a professor who labelled affirmative action a racist policy. The chairperson demanded I apologise or leave the meeting. I left and never returned to the council.

Free, quality, decolonised education for all

I was politically active at Wits and was part of a militant socialist student society on campus. Little did we know that, 20 years later, we would see a powerful resurgence of student protests, one that at times would take aim at the failures of my generation to secure a truly democratic South Africa.

In 2015, students at the University of Cape Town called for the removal of a Cecil Rhodes statue and the end of institutional racism in the university. It was a movement borne from the same sense of alienation and frustration that I had felt so keenly as a student.

The protest sparked a wildfire that could not be easily quelled. Its slogans of black power and demands for the Africanisation of the university echoed the politics of the 1970s that I heard and embraced at home as a child.

At Wits, the Student Representative Council, an elected student body, decided to flex their muscles and quickly blocked all entrances to the institution, effectively shutting the place down.

They had become deeply frustrated when their demand to block a rise in tuition fees was summarily dismissed by the university. Within the space of a few days, tens of thousands of students from universities across the country had joined the protest movement calling for no rise in tuition fees.

The student mobilisation was massive - far bigger and noisier then we had been able to achieve in my days as a student activist.

During the occupation, a new form of organisation developed. It was a flat structure, where everybody led through the development of task teams for food, health, education, and shelter. At times it looked like a human beehive.

The entrenched culture of putting one's own political affiliations and agendas first was also set aside. Their almost continuous assembly became the heart of all debates and decision-making. New young black female voices also came to the fore.

I pitched up at the university a week after protests started to film the developments. I was promptly told by the student media task team that I and my camera team were not welcome inside the occupation. For any filming to take place I would need permission from the media committee.

Rather taken aback, I retorted: ""But don't you know who I am? I am the maker of Miners Shot Down.""

They replied: ""We don't care who you are, don't come here with your ego.""

It was a wakeup call. The students were now in charge, and by then they were not simply demanding an end to rising tuition fees; they were demanding free, quality, decolonised education for all.

They were also pressing for the end of outsourcing support staff. About fifteen years back, Wits had cut costs by ending contracts for existing support staff, cleaners, kitchen, maintenance and ground staff and instead relying on outside private contractors who had to work without benefits such as medical aid and housing allowance.

Unfinished business: A new generation of activists

The student rebellion had reminded me of the unfinished business of transitioning to a democracy.

Twenty years ago, black students at Wits were still a minority, something that forced us to tread carefully but also bred a conservatism that was born of the fact that we were being groomed to enter a system whose racial exclusivity in many ways remained intact.

This generation did not have much time for the likes of my generation of anti-apartheid activists who behaved like they knew what was best for the young.

The students felt the elders were not listening to them or, at best, were indifferent to their experience and pain. The context of fear and insecurity of one's own future is prevalent. Unemployment figures officially stand at 28 percent nationally and 55 percent for those between 15 and 24 years of age, the highest figure in the world for a middle-income economy like ours.

I was witnessing a rigorous re-examination of the entire foundations that underlay the new South Africa. I was at once suspicious and enthralled and this tension led me to commit to the film project if they resolved to fight on.

Students, perhaps more so than other groups, can be fickle; they are on their way up. My initial mistrust of their resolve and commitment to social change quickly melted away as they pressed home their demands regardless of personal consequence and won an astonishing victory that ended outsourcing.

While at times they showed unbridled self-importance, a moral righteousness which I could understand, the tendency to essentialise race I found reprehensible and a step backwards.

But it was clear to all that a new generation with a steely resolve to challenge the status quo had emerged, an inheritance that my own peers had failed to change, a point they would continually painfully remind us of.

They made me feel complicit in our highly unequal society and in some ways they are right.

I realised that it was now their turn to take the agenda forward as it was only they who had the militancy and energy to do so. They reminded me of my own youth and a sense of invincibility that comes at that age. I was envious of them but I considered myself as their kin as did many of my peers.

This informed the motivation and design of the film, to make a piece that, while capturing the highs and lows of their struggle, allowed us to reflect on the wider conversation and debate that they placed in very powerful terms onto the table, a cross-generational dialogue.

The film has found resonance around the world as others encounter the same problem: turning public goods and services into business operations is not working for society, particularly for the young.

In 2018, activists won a hugely significant reform: free education for the poor, and the equivalent of billions of US dollars injected into education.

They are continuing to agitate for more and those activists that have left university are to be found in all areas of civil society, reinvigorating our struggle to control our destiny and making me proud to be South African again.

The world needs to watch this space. They inspired us by turning what we have been told is impossible into the possible. They have embodied the 1968 slogan the reverberated around the world in the wake of an insurgent student movement: ""All power to the imagination"".","In the early 1970s, we often had black student radicals pass through.

50,'New Cold War': Trade war puts China-US ties at risk,Adrian Brown,"Beijing, China - They have been dismantling the old US Embassy in Beijing. Its diplomats moved to a vast complex on the other side of the city years ago.

But this week - of all weeks - Chinese workmen finally began tearing down the old building. It is happening brick by brick and seems like a fitting metaphor for the state of Sino-US ties.

Whatever the outcome of the 11th round of trade talks in Washington, the relationship is bad and it's going to stay bad for a long time.

The dispute is a symptom of wider friction between the world's two leading economies: Taiwan, the South China Sea, Huawei, Iran ... honestly, the list is endless.

It's a new Cold War with trade at its core.

Only this week, the United States barred China Mobile - the country's largest mobile provider - over espionage concerns - the same reason it gave for blocking Huawei, another Chinese telecommunications giant.

Chinese investment

More staggering, perhaps, is the steep drop in Chinese investment to the US - down more than 90 percent since the tariff war began more than 10 months ago.

It's been hard to gauge the impact of it all on Chinese consumers. In Beijing's busy Dahuangzhuang market this week, most shoppers shrugged their shoulders when asked how the dispute was affecting them.

But what has changed for some is the way they think about the US.

""It is the Americans' usual practice to bully others. The hegemonist countries always do this,"" said one man.

Another was more forthright: ""The government is being very weak now. But I think it is a deliberate strategy that we make concessions for future economic development. When we get strong enough, though, America should not even think about bombing us.""

The bombing he's referring to happened 20 years ago this week when US missiles struck China's embassy in Belgrade during NATO's bombardment of the former Yugoslavia.

Three Chinese journalists were killed. NATO called it an accident. China called it an act of war - and still does.

This is a year filled with political and emotionally charged anniversaries in China.

The most important one falls on October 1 - when it will be 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic. So this is a year when President Xi Jinping has to appear strong, especially over trade.

Critical year

For President Xi, the trade war is just one more concern in a critical year, says analyst Dan Wang of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

""The economic expectation is that the economy is going to be very weak. There are financial risks arising and the housing market is not particularly strong either. So what we are looking at is fragile economy and a very difficult situation from the outside,"" he said.

This could be why China suddenly appeared to harden its negotiating stance in the days leading up to the latest round of talks.

Analysts say President Xi felt his negotiators, led by Vice Premier Liu He, had simply conceded too much in the previous rounds.

He reportedly said: ""I will be responsible for the consequences.""

Since these talks began, the exact details of what has been discussed have never been officially divulged.

So we don't know for sure where there has actually been progress. Media reports have been largely based on speculation and unsourced officials ""with knowledge of the discussions"".

Hopes and fears

There could be a surprise breakthrough on Friday, but the likelihood is that these talks will drag on.

If the negotiations continue, then that could just be enough to stabilise China's jittery stock markets, which this week suffered their worst falls in more than three years. If not, it could turn ugly again for investors.

This, remember, was supposed to be the week when champagne corks popped as US and Chinese officials signed their elusive trade deal.

But on Sunday night, President Donald Trump detonated an art-of-the-deal hand grenade, just as he did over North Korea in Hanoi in February.

He tweeted the talks were, in fact, going too slowly, vowing to more than double tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods.

By Friday morning, there was a grim realisation among China's leaders that a full-blown trade war with the US was now about to become a reality.","Whatever the outcome of the 11th round of trade talks in Washington, the relationship is bad and it's going to stay bad for a long time.

51,'New Cold War': Trade war puts China-US ties at risk,About The Author,"Beijing, China - They have been dismantling the old US Embassy in Beijing. Its diplomats moved to a vast complex on the other side of the city years ago.

But this week - of all weeks - Chinese workmen finally began tearing down the old building. It is happening brick by brick and seems like a fitting metaphor for the state of Sino-US ties.

Whatever the outcome of the 11th round of trade talks in Washington, the relationship is bad and it's going to stay bad for a long time.

The dispute is a symptom of wider friction between the world's two leading economies: Taiwan, the South China Sea, Huawei, Iran ... honestly, the list is endless.

It's a new Cold War with trade at its core.

Only this week, the United States barred China Mobile - the country's largest mobile provider - over espionage concerns - the same reason it gave for blocking Huawei, another Chinese telecommunications giant.

Chinese investment

More staggering, perhaps, is the steep drop in Chinese investment to the US - down more than 90 percent since the tariff war began more than 10 months ago.

It's been hard to gauge the impact of it all on Chinese consumers. In Beijing's busy Dahuangzhuang market this week, most shoppers shrugged their shoulders when asked how the dispute was affecting them.

But what has changed for some is the way they think about the US.

""It is the Americans' usual practice to bully others. The hegemonist countries always do this,"" said one man.

Another was more forthright: ""The government is being very weak now. But I think it is a deliberate strategy that we make concessions for future economic development. When we get strong enough, though, America should not even think about bombing us.""

The bombing he's referring to happened 20 years ago this week when US missiles struck China's embassy in Belgrade during NATO's bombardment of the former Yugoslavia.

Three Chinese journalists were killed. NATO called it an accident. China called it an act of war - and still does.

This is a year filled with political and emotionally charged anniversaries in China.

The most important one falls on October 1 - when it will be 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic. So this is a year when President Xi Jinping has to appear strong, especially over trade.

Critical year

For President Xi, the trade war is just one more concern in a critical year, says analyst Dan Wang of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

""The economic expectation is that the economy is going to be very weak. There are financial risks arising and the housing market is not particularly strong either. So what we are looking at is fragile economy and a very difficult situation from the outside,"" he said.

This could be why China suddenly appeared to harden its negotiating stance in the days leading up to the latest round of talks.

Analysts say President Xi felt his negotiators, led by Vice Premier Liu He, had simply conceded too much in the previous rounds.

He reportedly said: ""I will be responsible for the consequences.""

Since these talks began, the exact details of what has been discussed have never been officially divulged.

So we don't know for sure where there has actually been progress. Media reports have been largely based on speculation and unsourced officials ""with knowledge of the discussions"".

52,Venezuela: Who are the colectivos?,Lucia Newman,"Caracas, Venezuela - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido arrived at a rally of several hundred waiting supporters last month in San Bernardino, a middle-class Caracas neighbourhood.

The stage where Guaido was set to speak was at the bottom of a long narrow street, where men, women and children had gathered.

Not long after Guaido arrived, tear gas engulfed the area, thrown by masked and heavily armed civilians on motorcycles.

From the stage, an organiser appealed to the crowd to crouch down, stay calm and not run, especially given the large number of elderly people and children there.

As soon as the gas dissipated, Guaido got on the stage just as more motorcycled men began firing live rounds, presumably to frighten off the opposition leader. He refused to budge. On this occasion, no one was killed or injured.

Venezuelans call these irregular armed gangs colectivos or collectives, while the UN Human Rights Commission describes them as para-police, or paramilitary forces loyal to President Nicolas Maduro.

Government opponents and protesters fear them far more than the police or the National Guard.

190123205835912

For years, they have served as an unofficial, parallel force to confront demonstrators with impunity. Often, they do not bother to cover their faces or hide their identities, as they move in to ""keep social order"" on behalf of Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution.

But for embattled President Maduro and his supporters, the collectivos are likened to ""angels of socialism"".

""I admire them. They are organisations created for the good of the community. The collectives work for society, for the sick, for peace, and against crime. They have been around for 20 years as a form of organisation of the people,"" said Maduro, the day after the San Bernardino incident.

He did not explain how they obtain tear gas - which is only supposed to be issued to riot police and National Guardsmen - or why many have licenses to carry weapons issued by security forces.

The San Bernardino incident came more than two months after Guaido invoked the Constitution to assume the interim presidency, declaring Maduro's 2018 re-election illegitimate. Maduro accuses Guaido and the United States of attempting a coup.

Since then, rival protests have often led to violent clashes between protesters and security forces, or often the colectivos.

'People power'

The colectivos' origins date back to the 1960s when leftist urban rebel groups inspired by the Cuban Revolution formed in Venezuela's working-class neighbourhoods to fight for social justice. Groups like the Tupamaros robbed banks and stole cars to finance their organisations.

190501205642791

By the time Chavez was elected in 1999, they'd given up on armed insurrection and decided to support his ""Socialism of the 21st Century"". Chavez encouraged and subsidised the formation of old and new ""collectives"", as guardians of the revolution. Many were given weapons.

Not all colectivos are alike, nor do they all function as paramilitary groups, there are colectivos that do community work and promote government social programmes.

Former urban guerrilla Juan Contreras leads the Simon Bolivar colectivo in the emblematic 23 de Enero working-class neighbourhood of Caracas, where he runs a community radio.

He is dedicated and tireless in the defence of ""people's power"". On the day I met him, he was screaming through a megaphone to alert residents to come and buy government subsidised fish for the Easter weekend.

Long gone, he said, are the days when he walked around carrying a gun, although, of course, he knows how to use one.

""I am a member of the Bolivarian Popular Militia now. If I have to take up arms and defend the revolution, that is from where I will do it,"" Contreras said.

But there are other colectivos that have been using their weapons for years for other purposes.

They are well known for carrying out extrajudicial killings, kidnapping, running extortion networks and controlling lucrative food distribution networks in the community, as well as trafficking in petrol and drugs along the border with Colombia.

190501084427750

Valentin Santana, the leader of the La Pedrita colectivo, arguably Caracas's largest and most powerful group, remains free and visible even though three arrest warrants have been issued against him for murder and attempted murder.

On April 30, the day of Guaido's unsuccessful attempt to inspire a military uprising, Santana brandished an assault rifle in a video posted on Twitter, in which he announced the time had come to defend the revolution with weapons in hand.

The next day, a paramilitary group fired live rounds at demonstrators from a government building in the opposition stronghold of Altamira. State police unsuccessfully attempted to confront the ""delinquents"".

The following day, the police director of operations who had commanded the operative was summarily dismissed for interfering with the gunmen.

Some argue that the government has lost control of these armed civilian bands. They do not answer to a single chain of command. But even the most unsavoury groups remain useful for intimidating, harassing, or forcibly mobilising their communities when necessary.

'Acts of state terrorism'

On February 23, the day that Maduro's opponents attempted to bring in truckloads of food and medicine from neighbouring Colombia, I witnessed just how efficient the pro-government paramilitary groups can be.

190222210148032

When tear gas and rubber bullets did not seem to deter a group of some 600 government opponents on the Venezuela side of the border in San Antonio, National Guardsmen withdrew and cleared the way for the masked men on motorcycles. Immediately, people began running, terrified.

The men fired at the crowd and at the adjacent buildings for at least two hours until the main street leading up to the Simon Bolivar Bridge looked like an abandoned war zone. It's unclear how many people were injured. I saw at least two people being dragged away, one with a gunshot wound to the head, while the masked men refused to let ambulances through.





When it was over, the para-militaries began looting a large sports store. Eventually, National Guardsmen arrived, joining in as the paramilitaries picked through t-shirts, backpacks and other choice items.

Venezuelan Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez claimed the armed civilians were ""Colombian paramilitaries"" - an argument that many on the border didn't buy.

The opposition-controlled National Assembly has designated these civilian bands as ""terrorist groups"" that carry out ""violent paramilitary actions, intimidation, murder and other crimes"" described as ""acts of state terrorism"".

But, despite an international outcry against the use of these groups in recent weeks, Maduro has come out firmly in their defence. And amid the continued attempts by his opponents to force him from office, he has called on the colectivos - without distinction - to take to the streets ""to every corner to defend the Revolution"".","Caracas, Venezuela - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido arrived at a rally of several hundred waiting supporters last month in San Bernardino, a middle-class Caracas neighbourhood.

55,Politics of fear in the Spanish elections,Sandra Gathmann,"It was election day and a cameraman and I were chasing voters outside a polling centre in Madrid.

All week, the media had hyped it to be the most ""divisive"" election in Spain's young democracy. They speculated that millions of torn and undecided voters might choose to stay home instead.

But this was the first sunny Sunday in weeks, and a steady stream of people had shown up to cast their ballots. What drove them here?

""We had to block the fascists,"" admitted our first victim.

190425204740082

""Because the left could put Spain's unity in danger,"" confessed the second.

My cameraman and I looked at each other to confirm the hunch we had formulated that week.

This election was running on fear of the far right and loathing of separatist movements.

Rise of Vox

The far-right Vox party's five-year journey from political obscurity to centre-stage rang alarm bells early on.

In the lead-up to 2018's regional elections in Andalusia, party leader Santiago Abascal was filling stadiums and spooking critics with pledges to ""Make Spain Great Again"" by fighting an ""Islamist invasion"" and reversing abortion laws that ""radical feminists"" had fought for.

Opinion pieces warned of threats to Spain's 40-year democracy and a return to the right-wing era under General Francisco Franco.

Abascal even addressed his enemies' fears head-on in a highly quoted speech. ""The left is obsessed with calling Spaniards who love Spain, fascists ... those of you who want to defend your borders and your country, xenophobes and fascists … those of you who like Spanish traditions, retrogrades and fascists.""

In response, supporters on social media embraced the label. ""If that's being fascist - then I am!"" they tweeted.

190428191917273

Vox went on to win a record number of votes, joining forces with the conservative People's Party and centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) party to unseat the socialists in Andalusia after 36 years.

By the time the 2019 general elections kicked off, there was growing uncertainty about whether the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) could win enough votes to keep their lead, or whether Vox would become kingmaker in a conservative coalition once again.

The party ended up getting 10 percent of the total vote, entering parliament for the first time.

So what led to the rise of Vox? In part, fear.

The party capitalised on culture clashes with left-wing proposals such as mandatory feminism classes in schools as well as animal rights groups' efforts to ban rural traditions like bullfighting and hunting.

We filmed inside one bullfighting ring in the small town of Santa Cruz de Mudela, where some fans told us that Vox was standing up for the sport.

""Bullfighting absolutely needs protecting because Spain wouldn't be Spain without it,"" said one woman.

But it all boiled down to one issue in particular - Spain's national unity.

Catalonia fear factor

We sat down with Jose Ignacio Torreblanca from the European Council on Foreign Relations who explained the rise of the far right is in part a reaction to the 2017 failed independence referendum attempt in Catalonia.

""When you have a nationalist push for an illegal attempt to secede and when you have victimisation in Catalan society saying 'Spain robs us, Spain oppresses us, Spain is nasty, Spain is poorer than us' ... you start feeding into a sentiment that was dormant,"" said Torreblanca.

""In the 2016 elections, parties presenting Franco nostalgia got 90,000 votes in a country of 45 million people,"" Torreblanca added. ""And now we're speaking of Vox getting 10 percent of the vote, which means something has been shaken. Someone has kicked the beehive and the bees are out.""

And frustration with the Catalans was not contained to the far right.

There was a backlash in moderate circles against Pedro Sanchez and his PSOE when they took power in 2018 and joined Catalan separatist parties in a coalition. The Catalans' demand for a new vote on independence was seen as a liability, especially after they voted down Sanchez's budget in protest, triggering elections.

A sort of ""Never Sanchez"" campaign was pushed by both the conservative People's Party and Ciudadanos, which conveyed that a vote for the socialists was a vote for political chaos.

Against the backdrop of the Venezuelan crisis, there were fears too that the far-left Podemos party (which has been accused of having been funded by Hugo Chavez's government) would once again share power with the socialists, and bring Spain's recovering economy to ruin.

Surprise turnout

If there was a single indicator that Spaniards felt their future was at stake in these elections, it was a very high turnout.

190429132609930

A total of 73 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots, mostly for the incumbent socialists, though they fell short of a parliamentary majority.

In Catalonia, participation reached record highs, with voters (including two-thirds of Catalans who consider themselves Spaniards) appearing to throw their weight behind moderate separatist parties.

The Republican Left of Catalonia party, which is most open to talks with Madrid, won 15 seats - up from nine in 2016. While the more hard line Together for Catalonia lost one seat, leaving it with seven.

When the results rolled in, one Spaniard confessed to me he was disappointed - not with the result themselves - but the fact they did not convey party loyalty.

These were ""votos del miedo"" or ""votes out of fear"", said Jaime. ""People just wouldn't have gone to the polls otherwise.""","This election was running on fear of the far right and loathing of separatist movements.

56,Politics of fear in the Spanish elections,About The Author,"It was election day and a cameraman and I were chasing voters outside a polling centre in Madrid.

All week, the media had hyped it to be the most ""divisive"" election in Spain's young democracy. They speculated that millions of torn and undecided voters might choose to stay home instead.

But this was the first sunny Sunday in weeks, and a steady stream of people had shown up to cast their ballots. What drove them here?

""We had to block the fascists,"" admitted our first victim.

190425204740082

""Because the left could put Spain's unity in danger,"" confessed the second.

My cameraman and I looked at each other to confirm the hunch we had formulated that week.

This election was running on fear of the far right and loathing of separatist movements.

Rise of Vox

The far-right Vox party's five-year journey from political obscurity to centre-stage rang alarm bells early on.

In the lead-up to 2018's regional elections in Andalusia, party leader Santiago Abascal was filling stadiums and spooking critics with pledges to ""Make Spain Great Again"" by fighting an ""Islamist invasion"" and reversing abortion laws that ""radical feminists"" had fought for.

Opinion pieces warned of threats to Spain's 40-year democracy and a return to the right-wing era under General Francisco Franco.

Abascal even addressed his enemies' fears head-on in a highly quoted speech. ""The left is obsessed with calling Spaniards who love Spain, fascists ... those of you who want to defend your borders and your country, xenophobes and fascists … those of you who like Spanish traditions, retrogrades and fascists.""

In response, supporters on social media embraced the label. ""If that's being fascist - then I am!"" they tweeted.

190428191917273

Vox went on to win a record number of votes, joining forces with the conservative People's Party and centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) party to unseat the socialists in Andalusia after 36 years.

By the time the 2019 general elections kicked off, there was growing uncertainty about whether the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) could win enough votes to keep their lead, or whether Vox would become kingmaker in a conservative coalition once again.

The party ended up getting 10 percent of the total vote, entering parliament for the first time.

So what led to the rise of Vox? In part, fear.

The party capitalised on culture clashes with left-wing proposals such as mandatory feminism classes in schools as well as animal rights groups' efforts to ban rural traditions like bullfighting and hunting.

We filmed inside one bullfighting ring in the small town of Santa Cruz de Mudela, where some fans told us that Vox was standing up for the sport.

""Bullfighting absolutely needs protecting because Spain wouldn't be Spain without it,"" said one woman.

But it all boiled down to one issue in particular - Spain's national unity.

Catalonia fear factor

We sat down with Jose Ignacio Torreblanca from the European Council on Foreign Relations who explained the rise of the far right is in part a reaction to the 2017 failed independence referendum attempt in Catalonia.

""When you have a nationalist push for an illegal attempt to secede and when you have victimisation in Catalan society saying 'Spain robs us, Spain oppresses us, Spain is nasty, Spain is poorer than us' ... you start feeding into a sentiment that was dormant,"" said Torreblanca.

""In the 2016 elections, parties presenting Franco nostalgia got 90,000 votes in a country of 45 million people,"" Torreblanca added. ""And now we're speaking of Vox getting 10 percent of the vote, which means something has been shaken. Someone has kicked the beehive and the bees are out.""

And frustration with the Catalans was not contained to the far right.

There was a backlash in moderate circles against Pedro Sanchez and his PSOE when they took power in 2018 and joined Catalan separatist parties in a coalition. The Catalans' demand for a new vote on independence was seen as a liability, especially after they voted down Sanchez's budget in protest, triggering elections.

A sort of ""Never Sanchez"" campaign was pushed by both the conservative People's Party and Ciudadanos, which conveyed that a vote for the socialists was a vote for political chaos.

Against the backdrop of the Venezuelan crisis, there were fears too that the far-left Podemos party (which has been accused of having been funded by Hugo Chavez's government) would once again share power with the socialists, and bring Spain's recovering economy to ruin.

Surprise turnout

If there was a single indicator that Spaniards felt their future was at stake in these elections, it was a very high turnout.

190429132609930

A total of 73 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots, mostly for the incumbent socialists, though they fell short of a parliamentary majority.

In Catalonia, participation reached record highs, with voters (including two-thirds of Catalans who consider themselves Spaniards) appearing to throw their weight behind moderate separatist parties.

The Republican Left of Catalonia party, which is most open to talks with Madrid, won 15 seats - up from nine in 2016. While the more hard line Together for Catalonia lost one seat, leaving it with seven.

When the results rolled in, one Spaniard confessed to me he was disappointed - not with the result themselves - but the fact they did not convey party loyalty.

These were ""votos del miedo"" or ""votes out of fear"", said Jaime. ""People just wouldn't have gone to the polls otherwise.""","This election was running on fear of the far right and loathing of separatist movements.

57,Trucking and the Indians hoping to cross the US-Mexico border,Shreen Khan,"San Francisco, California - For decades, Indian nationals have been making long journeys to reach the US-Mexico border. In some detention facilities in California, up to 40 percent of the people being held are reportedly from India, according to government data from last year.

Immigrants and asylum seekers from India travel more than 9,000 miles (14,484km) with paid ""agents"" who guide them on a route that snakes through multiple countries before reaching Mexico. In the first four months of 2018, there were 4,197 Indian nationals arrested by US Customs and Border Patrol. Some asylum seekers have told us they fled political and religious persecution in India.

Satnam Singh, a Punjabi Sikh immigrant, made the journey in 1979. He worked and travelled through seven countries before reaching the US-Mexico border and ultimately crossed into the United States by swimming across the Rio Grande. ""That night I've never forgotten,"" he told us earlier this year.

Today, Singh works as a truck driver, like thousands of fellow Sikh Americans.

Making inroads in the US

After receiving work authorisation, many immigrants and asylum seekers are drawn to truck driving because it offers drivers the chance to do work that doesn't require full English proficiency or a lot of start-up capital. It is also accessible. Aspiring truck drivers typically attend trucking school, obtain a commercial driver's license and pair with a more experienced driver to practice handling the truck.

Trucking is particularly popular among Sikhs. In the past two years, 30,000 Punjabi Sikhs have reportedly entered the industry. Nationwide, there are Punjabi-owned truck driving schools, companies, truck stops and Punjabi language resources on the industry. Roadside restaurants serving Punjabi food, dhaba, common in India and Pakistan, are also common along interstates in the US.

In our latest AJ+ Untold America series on the Indian American community, we focus on Punjabi Sikh truckers. We join Singh along his trucking route, and experience a day in his life on the road. In the cab of the truck, we hear Satnam's story of migration, how he spent the first few months in the US in a detention centre. He eventually received a green card.

As a practising Sikh, Singh covers his hair with a turban. He's experienced outward hostility in the decades he has lived in the US, which he attributes to lack of education. If Americans knew about Sikhism, that the religion has equality and justice in its foundation, he says, maybe the hate would stop.

He also doesn't dwell on it. Staying cheerful and upbeat, Singh is proud of what he has accomplished as an American citizen, and the Sikh community's legacy in his hometown of Yuba City in northern California. The city is known as Little Punjab where Sikh contributions stretch back more than a century. That history is not without conflict. Back in 1908, Punjabis were driven out of neighbouring Marysville during a spike in hostility against Asian immigrants. In 1923, the US Supreme Court revoked citizenship and landowning rights of Indian men. And the following year, immigrants from Asia were blocked from immigrating to the US entirely.

Today, there is no shortage of hate crimes against Sikh Americans. But the community doesn't waver. Gurdwaras (or Sikh temples) remain open to all. Sikhs still serve free food to their neighbours through langar (the community kitchen) and tirelessly educate their brothers and sisters in the US.

59,Peterborough sends chilling message to UK Conservatives,Gavin O'Toole,"London, United Kingdom - A Eurosceptic party launched to pressure the UK government to quit the European Union without a formal Brexit deal has been extinguished in its parliamentary baptism of fire.

The Brexit Party, launched by Nigel Farage, was beaten into second place by the incumbent Labour Party in a by-election - although its massive vote sends a fearsome message to Britain's ruling Conservatives.

The result in Peterborough, a small city in eastern England, piles pressure on Conservative MPs to pick a charismatic hardliner in a party leadership contest now under way to replace Theresa May, who steps down on Friday.

It also shows the Labour opposition can still appeal to voters who want to leave the EU - strengthening party leader Jeremy Corbyn's resistance to calls for a second Brexit referendum.

190605171242849

Labour's Lisa Forbes scraped to victory with 10,484 votes, beating by just 683 the Brexit Party's Mike Greene, who, with 9,801 votes, forced the Conservatives into third place.

The Brexit Party was publicly launched just eight weeks ago to press for a departure from the EU on 31 October without a formal withdrawal deal - which many economists say would be disastrous.

It swept to victory in European elections last month, forcing May to finally name the date of her departure and strengthening the hand of Brexiteers within her cabinet pressing for an exit from the EU with or without a deal.

Breakthrough despite failure

Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University London, said: ""The result is big enough to scare the Conservative Party about what the Brexit Party might do at a general election, so it is a breakthrough - it shows that their appeal isn't simply limited to European Parliament elections.""

David Jeffery, a lecturer in British politics at the University of Liverpool who has studied the Conservative Party, said Farage will be ebullient, despite failing to win the seat.

""The real take-home from this is that it is the first example that we are pretty much living in a four-party system at the moment and that is the new status quo - and it also shows that the Brexit Party will harm the Conservatives much more than they will harm Labour.""

The poll was triggered in Peterborough - which has a rapidly growing population of European migrants and has been hit hard by government spending cuts - when the sitting Labour MP was removed following a conviction for lying about a speeding ticket.

Seen as the ""mother of all marginals"" for its history of swinging back and forth between Conservative and Labour representatives, Peterborough voted to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum, with many of the ""leavers"" natural Labour voters.

All eyes were on the city on Thursday to see what message a breakthrough by Farage would send.

'No deal' appeal

The result will cast a shadow over the Conservatives as candidates battle to take over as leader from May by the end of July, with populist frontrunners, including Boris Johnson basing their appeal on taking a hardline stance with Brussels.

Bale said: ""The Brexit Party has done well enough to continue scaring the Conservative Party into electing someone who will at least promise a 'no deal' Brexit if they can't get what they want - and it also probably strengthens the idea that they need to elect someone with the charisma to match Farage.""

Oliver Patel, a research associate at the University College London European Institute, said the vote merely confirmed what the Conservative leadership candidates already knew - that there is a solid constituency of support for a ""no deal"" Brexit.

190408100826063

""But what we have learnt from this by-election and the European elections is that although there is a chunk of people who want a 'no deal' Brexit, it is nowhere near a majority.

""So it would be dangerous for them to read too much into that as the new 'will of the people', which seems to be what the frontrunners are doing. After all, Labour still won.""

Jeffery added that the result does not change the underlying ""chicken and egg situation"" faced by the Conservatives, caused by May's failure to secure support for her Brexit withdrawal deal within parliament.

Local issues

Whoever becomes Conservative leader will be under pressure to hold a general election in order to secure a democratic mandate - which risks sabotaging any pledge to ensure Brexit takes place.

""The Peterborough result gives strength to the idea that you need to finish Brexit before you have a general election, but that doesn't take away the problem that you can't deliver a Brexit that is acceptable to some of the Conservative parliamentary party and most Conservative members without a radically different composition to the House of Commons,"" said Jeffery.

Labour's established campaigning infrastructure and experienced candidate - who came second in Peterborough in the 2015 general election - proved to be a key factor in last night's win.

Party activists in the constituency later insisted that the result vindicated their emphasis on local bread and butter pledges to prioritise schools, housing and jobs in the city against the single-issue focus of the Brexit Party solely on quitting the EU.

""Labour still has some appeal to leave voters and it also is able to put boots on the ground in a way that other parties can't because it has a much bigger membership,"" said Bale.

The result could strengthen the hand of Corbyn whose position of ""constructive ambiguity"" towards Brexit - insisting that the party must appeal to all its supporters regardless of their position on exiting the EU - has divided his MPs.

""Peterborough will strengthen the arguments of those in the Labour Party that they have to appeal to both leave and remain voters,"" said Bale.

""I'm not sure those arguments are very convincing - but I have no doubt that this result will be used to bolster them. Corbyn's conversion to a second referendum is unlikely.""

However, Patel added that under the ""constructive ambiguity"" strategy, Labour remains in a ""Catch 22"" whereby whichever course it takes will alienate some core voters.

""They will be relieved this morning and will certainly spin it as a success. But whether it shows the strategy is working is another question.""","London, United Kingdom - A Eurosceptic party launched to pressure the UK government to quit the European Union without a formal Brexit deal has been extinguished in its parliamentary baptism of fire.

60,The Murder of Marielle Franco,Juliana Ruhfus,"What the death of Brazil's famous activist reveals about the links between Rio's militia groups and corrupt politicians.

In March 2018, Marielle Franco, a prominent Brazilian human rights activist and politician, was murdered in mysterious circumstances.

A champion of the favelas, Rio's slum neighbourhoods, Marielle was also a vocal critic of the city's security forces - both official and unofficial - and the high cost in civilian casualties of their war against Rio's drug gangs.

So who killed her and why? And what does the investigation into her death reveal about the state of Brazil today?

FILMMAKER'S VIEW

By Juliana Ruhfus

I first started thinking about filming in Brazil in February 2018 when the Rio carnival got under way.

The country seemed divided as never before and the rise of the right was becoming a reality. Rio had already elected the ultraconservative, evangelical mayor Marcelo Crivella into office.

He was never going to be popular with the Samba schools but his decision to slash their budget gave rise to a giant float in the form of a butt with his name on it.

Commentators said that 2018 was the most political carnival since the end of the country's dictatorship in 1985. One parade had a puppet of the conservative President Michel Temer as a vampire wearing the presidential sash under several false dollar bills, and another showed the former President Lula de Silva dressed in prison clothes.

Corruption proved the winning theme and the top prize went to Beija Flor, whose parade featured a huge rat that was in charge of Brazil, while politicians were seen holding briefcases lined with gold.

Carnival, I thought, would be a great way into assessing Brazil's political landscape after the October 2018 elections.

And then Marielle Franco was killed just a month after carnival had ended. She was assassinated together with her driver Anderson Gomes by shots fired from a car after leaving an event that she spoke at on March 14, 2018.

Both a hero and a threat

Marielle's effective activism, courage and clarity had made her a rising star in Brazil's increasingly divided political world. As an Afro-Brazilian, gay, single mother from one of the city's poorest neighbourhoods, she used her role as a city councillor to empower these very constituencies.

Her success in doing so made her a hero to some and a threat to others.

I watched the outpouring of grief and rage that took place not just in Brazil but also around the world, and then, like so many others, I began to follow the investigation into her murder.

The professionalism of the killers was obvious from the first moment, and soon the bullets and weapons were linked back to the police, giving rise to suspicions that the assassins were members of the security forces or belonged to Rio's infamous paramilitary militia groups.

This more than anything else piqued my interest. We often see films about the drug gangs in Rio's favelas but Rio's militia groups had so far evaded the scrutiny of the international TV media.

Back in 2007, Brazilian director Jose Padilha made the multiple-award-winning movie Elite Squad that charted the militias' rise. It told the story of members of Rio's military police who joined militia groups because they felt that the law was not tough enough to take on the drug gangs. Elite Squad, and the sequel Elite Squad - The Enemy Within showed in gritty detail the violence, extrajudicial killings, and links with corrupt politicians that characterise these mafia-like groups.

It was a story better told in fiction than in fact: a year later, a team from the O Dia newspaper went undercover in a militia-controlled area but were discovered. All three were subjected to electric shock, asphyxiated with plastic bags, and beaten several times by kidnappers who insisted they were not criminals but policemen ""acting ahead of justice"".

Amazingly, as I began my own research I was soon talking to some of the very people on whose stories the Elite Squad characters were based: Vera Araujo, a courageous journalist who has dedicated her life to exposing the militia and who knows more about Marielle's killing than most investigators, and also Marcello Freixo, leader of the PSOL party that Marielle belonged to and her political mentor.

It was Freixo who had first put the militia into the spotlight by initiating a parliamentary inquiry in 2008 that resulted in a 300-page report and led to hundreds of arrests and recommended charges against 225 people including city councillors, police officers, prison officers and firefighters.

Until today, Freixo, now a congressman, lives under police protection.

Marielle, too, had contributed to the report and neither she nor her party, PSOL, shied away from calling out corruption and abuses of power.

Motive for murder

What interested me, as a reporter and filmmaker, was not just the importance of putting Marielle's life and death on record, but also the idea of using a film about the investigation into her killing as a way of shedding light on Rio's out of control security forces and militia.

An early theory was that Marielle had been murdered by the security forces themselves. She was a frequent and fearless critic of the police's military-style operations in Rio's favelas that left a trail of death and she even took the risk of naming specific police battalions.

Marielle used her role as a city councillor to empower underrepresented constituents in Rio's favelas [Al Jazeera]

However, the idea that the police killed Marielle Franco was side-lined when Rio's homicide division collected testimony from a man who said he had heard city councillor Marcello Siciliano order militia leader Orlando Oliveira de Araujo aka ""Curicica"" to kill Marielle.

Investigators said they believed that Marielle had clashed with Siciliano because she empowered communities in neighbourhoods where he had construction and real estate interests.

This placed the motive for Marielle's murder right into the militia heartland in Rio's west zone where corrupt politicians and militia members have built entire neighbourhoods, not filled with low-lying shacks but with multistorey dwellings, lacking any official permission. Yet, unlike the favelas where drug dealers show off their guns and drugs to visiting journalists these militia-held territories, which are home to two million residents and encompass a quarter of Rio, were completely off limits to us.

The Siciliano-Curicica theory soon proved deeply flawed. Both, the councilman and the militia leader who is imprisoned in northern Brazil, were insisting that they were being framed with the help of the police.

Angrily, Curicica started divulging the secrets of Rio's militia and his testimony gave rise to two new investigations, one by Rio's public prosecutor into Marielle's killing and another by Brazil's Federal Police into homicide police corruption. They are investigations full of twists and turns that will hopefully be completed so that one day another movie can tell the full story.

Questions remain

To date two things stand out for me:

Many feel that Marielle is wielding as much power in death as she did in life. The investigation into her killing by Rio's Public Prosecutor has resulted in the indictment and arrest of some of Rio's most notorious militia leaders and the investigation seems far from over. After an era of impunity, some justice seems to be coming.

Secondly, the investigation into Marielle's killing is also revealing uncannily close connections that the newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro and his family have with corrupt policemen and the militia.

We were in Rio when Marielle's two alleged killers were arrested. The man who allegedly pulled the trigger lived in the same condominium as Bolsonaro and his daughter dated the president's son, while the alleged driver of the car posted a photo of himself and the president on Facebook. The president's family also had connections with other alleged militia members arrested by the Ministerio Publico.

At best, the militia are simply the president's constituency, at worst, the president and his family have some tough questions to answer.

Marielle's killers may have been caught but until those who ordered the killing have been identified, questions and suspicions will remain.

The outrage over Marielle's death gave momentum to the election of three more black female legislators into Rio's legislative assembly. [Al Jazeera]

And we did end up filming carnival, too, it became a battleground between the revellers and Bolsonaro. Many on the left, like our interviewee Flavia Candido, dressed up as an orange in a wordplay that ridicules the alleged corruption of Bolsonaro's son Flavio.

Marielle's supporters found some justice in the Sambodrome. The 2019 winning Samba school was Mangueira who had put Marielle's life and achievements at the very centre of its parade. Her mentor, Congressman Marcello Freixo and her partner, Monica, took part in the parade, proving that in Brazil carnival will stay political for some time to come.

61,Steal from the Capitalists,Evan,"Evan ""Rabble"" Henshaw-Plath is a coder, activist, anarchist, and a hacker. He is also one of the original developers of Twitter.

Programmers are like digital superheroes. Everybody else gets to use the technology, the reality in which we play - but the programmers get to reshape the rules, the physics of our digital universe. Evan ""Rabble"" Henshaw-Plath

Henshaw-Plath believes that, as a tech activist, his role is to promote social justice, and he is eager to empower civil society to influence politics through the use of software. He explains how TxTMob, a platform that enabled protesters to send text messages to large groups anonymously, formed the basis of Twitter.

But when he came to the realisation that Twitter was not the world-changing idea he had hoped it would be, he sold his share.

Now bridging the worlds of hackers, activists and Silicon Valley start-ups, he's on a mission: to use techniques he has learned in the world of lean start-ups to support the technology being developed by activist groups.

The technologies he's promoting are all about allowing people to truly have secure communications, and his attempts to use Silicon Valley techniques have provoked resistance from his radical colleagues.

Can Henshaw-Plath convince the activists to steal from the capitalists in the name of efficacy, or is that a political compromise too far?

DIRECTOR'S VIEW

By Yasmin Fedda

The Chaos Communication Camp, one of Europe's largest hacker gatherings, featuring camping with electricity cables, its own internal Internet service and strict rules on filming and photography, takes place outside Berlin every four years. Hackers and coders gather to relax, connect with friends and discuss the pertinent matters of the day - issues around the development of new technologies and the pressing political questions of surveillance and privacy. At night, the camp is lit up with light and laser shows.

Evan Henshaw-Plath gets up on stage in one of the main events tents at the camp and says to an audience of nearly 1,000: ""We need to steal from the capitalists."" Evan is on a mission - to use the techniques he has learned and developed in Silicon Valley and various tech start-ups for the benefit of the activists and hackers working to develop secure communications technologies, which are essential tools for social and political movements to be able to organise.

My interest in activism and technology goes back to the anti-globalisation movement in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Just before midnight on July 21, 2001, I was in a school being used as the Indymedia centre for the anti-G8 protests in Genoa. Indymedia was a global network of media activists, which, in the early 2000s, and before the advent of social media, blogging, and smart phones, was experimenting with alternative ways of presenting the news by using the Internet as a platform. I was in the building for a meeting to discuss what to do next, after days of intense demonstrations in which one protester was killed. There were also lawyers in the building discussing how to use the evidence they had gathered of police brutality at the protests.

There was suddenly a lot of tear gas outside, and police helicopters were circling above. The police forced their way into the building and beat some people and arrested others. They broke computers and equipment and took away cameras and computer hard drives. I hid, terrified, under a table.

The police then proceeded across the road into another school building where many protesters were sleeping. They indiscriminately attacked the people there and arrested many. I was with those on the other side where we could only witness what was happening and scream in anger.

After the police left and emptied the building of activists, many of us who were on the other side went into the school and walked around. It had been trashed. There was blood on the walls and on the floors. It was a terrible scene of police brutality. But we were alone. We couldn't instantly share or get a message out to the wider world about what had just happened.

Phone calls were made to the mainstream media, politicians and diplomats, but it took some time for news of this event to be circulated. Several of the people who were arrested that night, it was later revealed, had been tortured by the police in secret locations. Although this went on to become a major case in Italy, and a number of those involved were tried in court, none of the police responsible have served time for their actions.

Although I thought I was politically aware, this was the first time I had direct experience of the need to create an alternative media. When the protests and uprisings began across the Middle East in 2011 it was fascinating to see the shift in news sharing, how different types of social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook, were being utilised as tools of communication to directly share what was happening through individual people's experiences. The news was being shared by these tools in a much more direct way than by the mainstream media.

When I was I thinking about ideas for this film, a friend from activist circles suggested I speak to Evan Henshaw-Plath. Evan was one of the co-creators of Twitter but also had a long and dedicated activist background. He had been involved with Indymedia from its early days during the Seattle World Trade Organisation protests in 1999 and stayed involved with its development in different countries around the world for many years afterwards. When I met Evan, I was excited to work on a film with him as he brought all these various interests together having been a developer and coder for Indymedia, Twitter and other fascinating technologies.

When you make a film, stories get simplified, and a lot of detail gets put aside to be able to construct a narrative that makes sense. The story of Indymedia, Twitter, hackers and activism have so many other people involved, who are no less important, but I could not include all these fascinating stories. I learned that with technology and the Internet, innovations and creations are made collaboratively, building on the work of others, and normally shared.

There isn't one person behind any new technology or software but a group of people and ideas coming together. However, Evan was my portal into this world and his personal journey reflects some interesting developments in technology in the past decade. His mission today, and his belief that the values of coders, hackers and programmers do inform the technologies they create, and that these matter in what gets made in the future, is a lesson for us all.

62,Steal from the Capitalists,Rabble,"Evan ""Rabble"" Henshaw-Plath is a coder, activist, anarchist, and a hacker. He is also one of the original developers of Twitter.

Programmers are like digital superheroes. Everybody else gets to use the technology, the reality in which we play - but the programmers get to reshape the rules, the physics of our digital universe. Evan ""Rabble"" Henshaw-Plath

Henshaw-Plath believes that, as a tech activist, his role is to promote social justice, and he is eager to empower civil society to influence politics through the use of software. He explains how TxTMob, a platform that enabled protesters to send text messages to large groups anonymously, formed the basis of Twitter.

But when he came to the realisation that Twitter was not the world-changing idea he had hoped it would be, he sold his share.

Now bridging the worlds of hackers, activists and Silicon Valley start-ups, he's on a mission: to use techniques he has learned in the world of lean start-ups to support the technology being developed by activist groups.

The technologies he's promoting are all about allowing people to truly have secure communications, and his attempts to use Silicon Valley techniques have provoked resistance from his radical colleagues.

The Chaos Communication Camp, one of Europe's largest hacker gatherings, featuring camping with electricity cables, its own internal Internet service and strict rules on filming and photography, takes place outside Berlin every four years. Hackers and coders gather to relax, connect with friends and discuss the pertinent matters of the day - issues around the development of new technologies and the pressing political questions of surveillance and privacy. At night, the camp is lit up with light and laser shows.

63,Patriotic Highway: A Tale of Justice and Corruption in Kosovo,Marie Tuma,"A Swedish judge in Kosovo takes on EULEX's largest corruption case and fights to keep politics out of her courtroom.

""Every case has a unique meaning for the future,"" says Marie Tuma, a Swedish criminal judge.

She is working with EULEX in Kosovo, an EU-operated mission which aims to get the state's justice system on its feet.

Tuma has been assigned to preside over the mission's largest corruption case; among the accused is Fatmir Limaj, a former Kosovo Liberation Army commander and the current deputy prime minister.

Sometimes I have the feeling that it's the criminal world that rules. It feels like the entire society is built on corruption. Marie Tuma, Criminal judge

Limaj was accused by EULEX's prosecutors of ""manipulating tender procedures, giving and receiving bribes and obstructing evidence in relation to three tenders"" while handling construction projects as the minister of transport between 2008 and 2010, amounting to about two million euros (roughly $2.2m) in alleged damage to the ministry's budget. At the time, the ministry was building highways linking Kosovo to Albania.

In the courtroom, Tuma faces constant challenges; she must navigate Kosovo's system of entrenched politics while also feeling pressure from within EULEX, which is downsizing its offices and is caught up in its own power games.

As Tuma fights to protect her courtroom from political interests and worries that her personal safety is at risk, she finds herself more isolated than ever.

Still, she tries to hold on to her faith in justice.

""This is something deeply rooted within me. Since I was a child, I have believed that the good will overcome the evil,"" Tuma says.

With constant twists and turns, the unfolding trial exposes complex powers at play and a nation recovering from its divided past.

FILMMAKER'S VIEW

By Caroline Troedsson

When the international lawyer, Marie Tuma, was appointed as presiding judge in one of Kosovo's most important criminal court cases, I travelled to the Balkans to follow her.

On the first day of filming the trial, it became obvious that this would not resemble anything I'd expect it to be. It kicked off a recording period of a little more than two years with many more unexpected twists than I could ever have dreamed of.

When Kosovo declared independence in 2008, EULEX was set up by the European Union to ensure a functioning rule of law. That's why we stepped into a court in Kosovo with a Swedish judge, US prosecutor and Kosovan defendants and defence lawyers, who were soon joined by a British star lawyer.

Tuma's experiences with previous international courts had well-equipped her to deal with turmoil and sudden changes inside the courtroom.

But it is not a common corruption case. Soon, growing expectations from the EU member states towards EULEX made it necessary to protect the trial from political interests.

Making a film in Kosovo meant I had to learn about the region's trauma, listening to testimonies from those who managed to escape the latest ethnic conflict in the 1990s.

There was so much I had never heard of before, which gave a deeper understanding of the moments of tension inside the courtroom. There were many implicit references to the past, and the main accused Fatmir Limaj took us on a personal journey into the past in Patriotic Highway.

After his efforts as a military commander in the liberation army KLA (UCK) during the 1990s, he joined the top level in the government. However, suspicions of corruption soon began to spread - threatening the political career of Limaj.

The main trial in Patriotic Highway started in 2015 and was the result of five years of investigation into suspected organised crime. It turned out that the corruption allegations had more than one guise, and doubt became Limaj's heaviest defence.

My time making this film has made me think a lot about the limitations of the justice system. There's a difference between wanting the truth to materialise and chasing evidence to convict someone in a court.

Where the truth has nuances, the law is a single-track. When a country is constructed from scratch, you work on more than the rule of law to gain your citizen's trust. But if there is room for suspicion that the judiciary cannot withstand political influence, the trust in pretty much everything collapses.

In May 2019, we elected our members to the European Parliament. After filming Patriotic Highway, nothing felt more important than to vote for those who fight for the core values of democracy in everything that is the EU's responsibilities.

64,The Gaza Gas Deal,Dania Akkad,"Natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean is a highly-prized commodity.

In 1999, geological surveys revealed that there were natural gas fields off the coast of Gaza. But through a series of poor decisions, questionable leadership and regional geopolitics, the so-called Gaza Marine gas field has lain dormant for 20 years.

So why has Gaza's gas not been exploited for decades? And why has such a major story received relatively little media attention? While making this film, Al Jazeera obtained exclusive documents revealing correspondence between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and other bodies involved in the negotiations.

When mineral engineers first told Yasser Arafat about the potential gas resources off Gaza, he proclaimed it ""a gift from God to the Palestinian people"". The geological surveys suggested that this gas was good quality, of real value, and within easy reach of Gaza's coastline. It was seen by many as a way for Palestinians to achieve energy independence and perhaps a little sovereignty.

""If our gas and oil are produced properly, Palestine in general and Gaza, in particular, won't need international aid anymore,"" says Yousef al-Mansi, a former Palestinian minister.

But the PA seemed strangely hesitant right from the start.

The Palestinians in Gaza right now are energy dependent. Meanwhile, off their coast, they have gas that could make them energy rich. Dania Akkad, senior editor at Middle East Eye

Added to that, a non-competitive contract with British Gas in 1999 gave Palestinians a minor share of potential gas revenues. Later, Israel - an obvious market - blocked a deal with British Gas in 2003, while Egypt began selling gas to Israel, commandeering what would have been Gaza Marine's share of the market.

What's more, a veil of secrecy surrounds the deal-making.

""For 20 years, the PA continued to hide facts and refused to answer questions asked by several parties around the world,"" says economic analyst Rami Abdo.

No one at the PA would talk to Al Jazeera about the deal, while political divisions within the governing authority have weakened its ability to exploit a potentially life-changing resource.

""Look at the rest of the region,"" says Dania Akkad, a senior editor at Middle East Eye. ""They’ve all discovered gas and they’re all now thinking they’re going to be the next wealthy rich-in-gas countries. Meanwhile, people in Gaza just sit with the gas out in the ocean.""

""It's exactly as if you were somebody who didn’t have any food to eat and you had a feast put in front of you and you were told you were not able to eat this feast,"" she says.

As the blockade of Gaza continues, its people spend half their lives in darkness in a perpetual energy crisis, while the answer to many of their economic problems lies below the seabed a few kilometres away.

""The Palestinians in Gaza right now are energy dependent,"" Akkad says. ""Meanwhile, off their coast, they have gas that could make them energy rich.""

There are now at least eight gas fields which experts say international maritime law gives the Palestinians the right to exploit - if only they were allowed.

All this time, Israel's first gas field right next to Gaza Marine, called Leviathan, is due to come on stream later in 2019. The PA once contemplated buying Israeli gas from Leviathan. Although the deal was stopped, the irony of it sums up the PA’s two decades of failure to tap into Gaza Marine - while Israel's continued efforts ensure they may never succeed.

65,Delhi's Deadly Air,Dr Arvind Kumar,"Delhi, India's vast central metropolis and the sprawling seat of government, has the deadliest air of all the world capitals - routinely exposing millions of its inhabitants to a shocking range of life-threatening diseases, which in turn cause thousands of fatalities every year.

So why is Delhi's air so polluted? And what if anything is being done to clean it up?

On the occasion of World Environment Day, we asked journalist Neha Mehta, who was born and raised in the city, to find out.

FILMMAKER'S VIEW

By Neha Tara Mehta

When you begin to look into air pollution in India, some very disturbing numbers soon grab your attention.

Take the biggest of them: In 2017, according to a recent study published in the Lancet, an astonishing 1.24 million people died because of India's dirty air. Of these, nearly 12,000 fatalities were in Delhi, the country's seat of government.

I was born in Delhi and have lived there most of my life. In the last few years that I have been away, I watched with growing panic as it made the headlines for being the world's most polluted capital city.

Delhi, home to more than 20 million people, is the world's most polluted capital [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]

This January, we celebrated my niece's third birthday on a particularly smoggy day with masks at a picnic in the city's iconic Lodhi Garden - a poignant reminder of the compromised childhood our next generation is living.

That's why this was a hard assignment for me. Unlike most other stories I've covered, air pollution affects me personally - just as it does my interviewees. And frustratingly, there are no quick or easy solutions. The rapidly growing city has an uphill task in cleaning up its air; its complex geography and meteorological factors exacerbated by a mix of politics, poverty and a seeming disregard for rules.

Zero good air quality days in 2018

As I started work on this film, the other number that caught my attention amid the big pollution statistics was: zero.

Greenpeace campaigner Sunil Dahiya first tweeted it: Delhi had zero good air quality days in all of 2018, he tabulated.

It's a figure that gets lost in official figures of 159 ""good, satisfactory and moderate"" days in 2018. I later confirmed the zero figure with the environment ministry.

In Delhi, the only requirement for you to be affected by the ill effects of air pollution is that you should be breathing. Dr Arvind Kumar, Lung Care Foundation

But I was to encounter the number yet again - this time through environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta, who showed me National Crime Records Bureau statistics on the number of criminal cases registered by authorities in Delhi against air pollution offenders.

It was zero.

""Despite the air quality emergency in Delhi, there's no question of anyone getting convicted for the simple reason that no case is being registered,"" said Dutta.

Dr Arvind Kumar of the Lung Care Foundation told me that he has noticed an increasing incidence of lung cancer among non-smokers, younger people and women. In fact, he says, these days he rarely sees clean, pink lungs - even in teenagers.

""In Delhi, the only requirement for you to be affected by the ill effects of air pollution is that you should be breathing.""

One breath at a time

I met one of those patients, who would previously have been an anomaly in the statistics but is now more commonplace.

Priyanka Jain is 26 and she's been diagnosed with a stage 4 lung cancer, despite not smoking or having any family history of cancer. Her right lung almost completely damaged, she practices pranayama, yogic deep breathing to keep herself going.

One morning, we climbed up five floors to her terrace to do yoga. By the third floor, she was panting.

""This is what lung cancer does to you,"" she said. However, with a resilience I will never forget, she went on to complete the exercise, one breath at a time.

Waste pickers are often forced to involve their children in hazardous work in open landfills and dumpsites [Al Jazeera]

I found some of the worst affected by Delhi's air pollution just a few kilometres from where I live - members of a waste-picker community, scratching out a subsistence living from the city's rubbish.

Flies swarmed through the thick air as children played amid mounds of refuse. We saw a young girl pick up pieces of plastic to use as fuel on a biomass stove, a strong source of household air pollution.

Chitra Mukherjee of NGO Chintan explained that because of their meagre income, waste pickers are forced to involve their children in hazardous work in open landfills and dumpsites. Not surprisingly, they have high rates of tuberculosis, pneumonia and asthma.

But things aren't much better for children in upscale South Delhi.

We met Dr Shailendra Bhadoriya, a cardiologist who lives close to an incinerator. He told me how he'd had to rush his eight-year-old daughter Nandini to the hospital several times with severe bouts of cough. So, he'd bought a nebuliser for her.

""I have no choice but to make a hospital-like setup at home,"" he said.

Cardiologist Shailendra Bhadoriya had to rush his eight-year-old daughter Nandini to the hospital several times with severe bouts of cough [Al Jazeera]

It's anxieties like this that are turning more and more parents into clean air activists. Bhavreen Kandhari, a mother of two is a #MyRightToBreathe member and campaigned to include air pollution in party manifestos.

The recent national elections marked the first time that major parties actually listened to those like Kandhari - but even so, pollution was far from central to the political agenda.

""Citizens are talking and parties are responding. But these promises mean nothing to me. Their implementation will be key,"" she said.

The politics of pollution

To understand the policy challenges of cleaning up one of the city's major polluters, the transport sector, I went in search of Jasmine Shah, my senior from public policy graduate school. He now heads the Delhi government think-tank and has worked on an ambitious electric vehicle plan.

""In a city like London, the mayor is responsible for almost all transport issues,"" Shah explained. ""But in Delhi, you have the central government, the state government and local bodies which have no accountability towards the state government.""

Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told me that this multiplicity of government is ""killing Delhi"".

""The biggest cause of the city's pollution is its politics, horrible governance model and the central government's unnecessary intervention in our work,"" Sisodia said.

Like many big cities around the world, there's pollution from too much traffic and from industry, but there are also specific local causes such as Delhi's geography and poverty [Al Jazeera]

Across the political divide, we heard a similar comment, this time directed at the Delhi government.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief in Delhi, Manoj Tiwari, acknowledges things are bad and has even has been distributing masks to his supporters. He says the federal BJP government is building expressways and other infrastructure to reduce pollution, but much of the responsibility lies at the local level.

""The Delhi chief minister controls the pollution board. That's something we cannot change. So, we are worried and are continuously working with citizens to beat pollution.""

While the politics of pollution may be working against the city right now, with Delhi state elections coming up next year, its citizens will have one more chance to push the issue up the political agenda.

It's a chance the city deserves to shed the tag of the capital with the dirtiest air.

66,Crimea: Russia's Dark Secret,Safinar Dzhehmilev,"Since March 2014, 30 Crimean Muslim Tatars have been imprisoned on charges of ""extremism"". Forty-four activists have been abducted, 19 of whom are still missing, while six have been found dead. The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, known as the FSB, is allegedly the main culprit behind these incidents.

For decades, Crimea's Muslim Tatars have been pinpointed for discrimination by Russia as the Tatars' opposition of Moscow's rule and ambitions have made them prime targets.

""I was kidnapped by people in military uniform without insignia. They put a sack over my head and took me away,"" an anonymous source told Al Jazeera. ""They kept me in a cellar, tortured me and threatened my life. They try to recruit you as an informer. To inform on your own people and betray them.""

We are the soul of this land, the salt of this earth. Safinar Dzhehmilev, Muslim Tatar living in Crimea

Before the invasion of 2014, Crimea was a part of Ukraine, reformed when the Soviet Union broke up into separate states - something that many Russians, including President Vladimir Putin, were unhappy about.

However, since the Russian Federation's annexation of Crimea in early 2014, hostilities against the Muslim Tatar community by Russian authorities have notably increased in episodes of intimidation, aggression, disappearances and even alleged murder.

""After the annexation I was in Crimea and we all witnessed it. It was horrific. Armoured Russian military personnel carriers were driving along the roads. Russian Cossacks were walking the streets intimidating people. Ukrainian citizens had their passports taken and ripped up,"" says Evelina Arifova, deputy head of Crimea Civil Blockade.

The current reality of the situation in Crimea, however, means most incidents go unreported by the families of those missing as reprisals from authorities loom over their very existence.

This has also led to tens of thousands of Tatars fleeing north to various parts of Ukraine, seeking safety. Once the majority of the 2.5 million Crimean population, the Muslim Tatar community only accounts for 12 percent today, as Moscow encourages more Russians to move to the region.

Safinar Dzhehmilev refuses to leave her home in Crimea. She says the land belongs to the Muslim Tatars and should remain so. ""Our people deserve to live peacefully, happily on our own land.... It would be wrong to abandon this land and leave because it's our ancestral home.""

In 2018, the Crimean Bridge, a project linking Crimea with the Russian mainland, was inaugurated by Putin himself, as a symbolic gesture of presence and unification. The Tatars, devastated by the blatant disregard for ownership of their land, continue to hope for the release of those held by Russian authorities, while others pray for the ones they know nothing of.

FILMMAKER'S VIEW

By Jamie Doran

In the early hours of February 23, 2014, President Putin met his security chiefs at the Kremlin to discuss the collapsing pro-Russian regime of Viktor Yanukovich in Ukraine. Agreeing to provide Yanukovich with a safe haven in Russia, he then remarked to those present: ""We must start working on returning Crimea to Russia.""

Less than a month later, Crimea was formally incorporated into the Russian Federation after a hastily-arranged and internationally condemned referendum.

Since then, Crimea has been conveniently forgotten by the outside world. Yes, there are sanctions in place; but, in reality, there seems to be a feeling abroad that Russia has completed a fait accompli by taking the peninsula by force, so why bother any more. But there are important factors which the world needs to be made aware of - which is why I decided to make this film.

It's almost certainly true to say that, simply by weight of population numbers, any referendum would have seen the majority ethnic-Russian voters victorious in their desire to secede to Moscow. However, the presence of thousands of heavily-armed Russian troops at the time of the referendum in 2014 made any voting process a farce.

But the most important factor is not to do with that vote almost five years ago. It has to do with Russia's apparent inability to allow peaceful, democratic opposition to its annexation of Crimea. Russia fears the voice of opposition, it always has, and it crushes it in the most violent way.

Until I began this film, I, like most people around the globe, knew virtually nothing of the plight of Crimean Tatars. I knew nothing about their history of deportations from their homeland over the centuries, nor of their struggle to return, time after time. Most significantly, I knew nothing of their present struggle against the might of the Russian security services.

A majority in the 19th century, today these Muslim Tatars make up around 12 percent of the peninsula's population of two-and-a-half-million. But it is to this minority that the mantle of protest has been passed. Almost exclusively, it is the Crimean Tatar population that continues to draw attention to what they call the ""illegal occupation"", and they are paying a dreadful price at the hands of Russia's FSB.

Almost 50 young Tatar men and women have disappeared since the annexation. Some managed to escape and brought with them terrible tales of torture and intimidation. Others were not that fortunate - their bodies turning up in shallow graves (with signs of horrendous torture). The rest have, simply, never been seen again. We spoke with several of the parents, distraught at the fate of their children, yet determined to carry on.

This is an extraordinarily defiant group: the most significant trait among the Tatars is their refusal to give up hope on all fronts and a determination never to bow in the face of superior odds. Against all the threats, all the inducements offered by Moscow, few will ever abandon their claim to their homeland.

I am a Russophile. I used to live in Moscow and genuinely love many aspects of Russian culture. There have been so many awful episodes of Russian history where it has had to fight off invaders, and its people have remained strong. Why, then, does it fail to understand others who oppose the invader?

It's time for Russia to stop wielding its ""iron fist"". Instead of its obsession with building bridges across the Black Sea, it's time for Russia to build bridges towards the Crimean Tatar community. Although they stand little chance of ever reversing the result of that referendum, it's time for Russia to recognise the Tatar's democratic right to peacefully oppose, without the threat of torture and death.

Source: Al Jazeera","Since March 2014, 30 Crimean Muslim Tatars have been imprisoned on charges of ""extremism"".
It has to do with Russia's apparent inability to allow peaceful, democratic opposition to its annexation of Crimea.
Until I began this film, I, like most people around the globe, knew virtually nothing of the plight of Crimean Tatars.

67,The Siege of Qatar,Noha Aboueldahab,"We examine the impact of the GCC crisis and question the future of inter-Gulf relations.

On June 5, 2017, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut off diplomatic ties with the state of Qatar.

Accusing it of funding ""terrorism"" and fermenting regional instability, all land, air and sea links to the country were severed.

National carriers declared they would be suspending flights to and from Qatar the following day, and those from Qatar were banned from even transiting through their countries.

It will never be the same. The sense of shock and betrayal following this blockade is something that will be very difficult to erase. Noha Aboueldahab, visiting fellow at Brookings Center, Doha

With the exception of Egypt, the blockading states recalled their own citizens and gave the Qataris residing and working in their countries 14 days to leave their territories.

The bloc of four also closed their airspace to Qatari aircraft, leaving only a small corridor, funnelling all their planes in and out of the Gulf.

At 1:30pm Qatar's only land border was closed and Saudi Arabia stopped all movement of vehicles from its side. Trucks carrying food, raw materials, equipment and medicines could no longer cross into Qatar. All vessels destined to, or carrying the flag of Qatar would not be allowed to call at ports in the UAE.

In less than 24 hours, Qatar was effectively cut off.

The coordinated move by the four countries has caused the greatest rift in years, between some of the most powerful Arab states. And the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) was unable to de-escalate the situation.

""The GCC was never intended to deal with an act of aggression between one of the constituent GCC members. This is unprecedented in the extent of it, the scope of it, how it took everybody by surprise,"" says Rory Miller, professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar.

However, he says, in recent history, there were many signs that Qatar was being targeted.

""This current crisis is not an isolated incident. From 1995 up to the present day the dominant team in relations between Saudi Arabia the UAE and Qatar has been one where Saudi Arabia and the UAE has viewed Qatar as definitely the subordinate actor and the Qataris have refused to accept this position,"" says Miller.

""You have a track record of the Gulf members of the current embargoing coalition breaking with Qatar over political issues, over security issues over the last 15 years.""

'It will never be the same'

In June 2017, the tiny desert country was highly reliant on produce from its neighbouring countries, and with those imports blocked, Qatar needed new suppliers. Iran declared that food shipments could be in Doha in 12 hours. Turkey also offered to help however it could.

To maintain stability, the wealthy Gulf state was required to open its coffers, injecting almost $40bn into its economy in the first two months of the crisis.

The blockade triggered Qatar to rethink its sustainability and independence and to set itself up for the future.

It built farms and was transforming its deserts into fertile land. A dairy farm was set up, flying in thousands of cows and producing its own line of products.

Just days before the one-year anniversary of the blockade, Qatar's government issued a directive banning all products from the blockading quartet.

This is an irrational, erratic crisis, it started for no reason, and in my opinion, it will end like this. The longer it continues, the more damage it will do to everybody. Abdullah Baabood, University of Cambridge research associate

The new trade links and self-reliance it had developed over the past year meant Qatar's decades-long dependence on its neighbours for produce and goods had been swept away.

Ignoring the calls for the blockade to end, there has been no softening of the position from the blockading nations.

""This is an irrational, erratic crisis, it started for no reason, and in my opinion, it will end like this. The longer it continues, the more damage it will do to everybody. It seems they have chosen the wrong country because Qatar has built its own resilience and has shown that it cannot and will not be bullied by their neighbours,"" says Abdullah Baabood, University of Cambridge research associate.

With neither side willing to back down, the future of the GCC is at stake.

""It will never be the same. The sense of shock and betrayal following this blockade is something that will be very difficult to erase,"" says Noha Aboueldahab, a visiting fellow at Brookings Center in Doha.

And while there has been no clear victor, the ambitions of the blockading quartet to change Qatar's foreign and domestic policies have failed.

""Their failure to get Qatar to concede or make considerate concessions, their failure to get European, Muslim, Asian and Middle Eastern actors to side with them over Qatar has actually highlighted the limitations of the Saudi-UAE axis as a dominant strategic player in the region,"" says Miller.

""So I think the best case scenario for a resolution to this conflict is a public agreement to continue to disagree privately.""

Many refugees, about 1.5 million, have chosen to remain in Colombia, but others have continued on to Ecuador, Peru, Chile or Mexico. As the crisis has worsened, most refugees leaving Venezuela today do not have enough money for a bus ticket and are forced to travel on foot.

To get from Cucuta to the next nearest town, these ""caminates"", or ""walkers"" must travel 195km, climb mountains 3,200 metres above sea level and then back down.

75,Giving Indonesia's children with disabilities a chance,Hassan Ghani,"Tatang was seven years old when a surgery to improve his failing vision went wrong and robbed him of his sight altogether.

""When I came home from the hospital, my heart was broken; I was a wreck,"" he says.

Eventually, with the support of friends and advice from other blind people, he picked himself back up. He learned Braille, a universally accepted system of writing used by and for visually impaired people, and went on to study anthropology at university.

When Tatang returned home in Indonesia's Bandung after graduation, he realised there were no education facilities for children with disabilities in his community. With financial support from his brother, he set up a school in his own home, teaching children to read Braille.

Today, many years later, the school teaches dozens of children with different needs. Along with minors with vision impairment, children with hearing impairment are taught sign language with the help of volunteers, while youngsters with Down's syndrome get the attention they need.

At times, Tatang struggles to keep the school operating.

""Following my brother's death, things have been very difficult for me, because not only the school, but my personal life was subsidised by him,"" he says.

Most of his students come from families below the poverty line, making it impossible for them to pay any kind of tuition fee towards the upkeep of the school.

Educational opportunities for children with disabilities in Indonesia remain limited. The Indonesian government says it is working towards improvement and passed a new disability rights law in 2016.

More recently, Tatang has been receiving some limited financial assistance from the local government, but he still relies heavily on donations from fellow Indonesians to stay afloat.

""I've never thought of giving up. No matter what, the students here are my responsibility, and I have to educate them, so they can have a bright future.""

77,Is the Gulf crisis solvable?,Inside Story,"Two years since Qatar was blockaded by four Arab nations, there is still no end in sight.

A lot can happen in 730 days except, it seems, in the Gulf crisis.

Arguably, the standoff between Qatar, and the group of four Arab nations which blockaded it, is still where it was two years ago.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, cut their diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, closed the only land border, and imposed an air and sea blockade on June 5, 2017.

Kuwait stepped in to mediate, but even as recently as last week, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister was saying Qatar must come back to the right path if there is to be a solution.

So, is this the ""new normal"" in the Gulf?

78,What can stop Turkey's economy from unravelling?,Durmus Yilmaz,"From credit-fuelled boom to currency crisis. As Turkey's economy unravels, we ask what can be done to stop the rot.

Istanbul plays an oversized role in the Turkish economy and politics. It has been the gateway to the presidency for Recep Tayyip Erdogan and represents a third of the country's economy.

After a quarter of a century, Erdogan lost the battle to control the financial capital but controversially another vote to elect the mayor has been planned.

It is just one of a number of issues that has many people and businesses losing faith in the country. After a credit-fuelled boom led to bust many are switching to the dollar. Foreign exchange deposits and funds rose to a record high of $182bn this month.

The lira has fallen about 37 percent since the beginning of 2018, pushing the economy into recession. The central bank has stopped short of implementing capital controls on the way governments limit the flow of money in and out of the country. During the boom years, delivered mostly through property and construction, corporations borrowed in dollars and are now finding it difficult to repay $200bn in loans.

Meanwhile, unemployment has jumped to a decade-high of 14.7 percent and inflation soared to 19.5 percent. The Turkish government has promised a series of financial reforms to revive the economy. But for now, many consumers are struggling to pay for imported goods.

Where did it all go wrong for the economy?

Our institutions are now paralysed. We need to rebuild our system by introducing a rule-based system in line with universal law, separation of powers, checks and balances. Otherwise, I believe the current system will self-terminate. Durmus Yilmaz, Turkey's former central bank governor

""In 2008, our GDP per capita was above $8,000 and it raised up to $12,000. But today we are below the 2008 numbers,"" says Durmus Yilmaz, former central bank governor. ""The reason behind it is the chosen growth model. You can't be a big economy with the skyscrapers you build in Istanbul, Ankara or Izmir, but they can be your prestige projects.""

""Turkey shall never capitulate them. All infrastructure, canal, railway, fast train projects must continue, even with [a] foreign subsidiary. Because these are the essentials of an economy. However, a substantial part of foreign money we received has been allocated to a construction sector that feeds 750 different sub-sectors. This created a boom in the economy. But at the end, your cash flow is in local currency but your debt is in foreign exchange. So we are stuck now.""

In order to fix the Turkish economy, he says ""our job is to follow token economy policies and build up the country's interest accordingly. As the opposition, we and others say the finance and treasury minister, the president's son-in-law, should resign. But this will not resolve the problem. This is a systemic issue. This system has paralysed the decision-making process in the economy. If you monopolise the authority, that person manages all.""

""We have to address the key trigger of the problem, which is this new presidential system, which is unique to Turkey. Our institutions are now paralysed. We need to rebuild our system by introducing a rule-based system in line with universal law, separation of powers, checks and balances. Otherwise, I believe the current system will self-terminate,"" Yilmaz says.

Mozambique's debt crisis

Mozambique is hoping to secure billions of dollars for reconstruction after the devastation of cyclones Idai and Kenneth. Cyclone Idai alone left more than 600 people dead and about 1.8 million people in need.

According to the United Nations, Mozambique needs $3.2bn for post-cyclone reconstruction. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says growth could slow to at least 1.8 percent from 3.5 percent from losses to agriculture, transport and communications. Food shortages in Beira, one of the hardest-hit cities, and surrounding areas could push prices up 8.5 percent from 5.5 percent.

Mozambique's port of Beira is an important hub for the country, as well as for neighbouring Malawi and Zimbabwe. But it is not operating right now. And according to the finance ministry, most homes, hospitals and schools had suffered large-scale destruction.

A debt crisis has complicated Mozambique's finances.

In 2016, it admitted to $1.4bn in undisclosed funding. That prompted the IMF to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and debt default. It has little hope of repaying the debt.

In 2017, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 112 percent. By 2022, the IMF forecasts that it could climb to over 130 percent. But the country is resource rich. It hopes to become the next liquified natural gas powerhouse. By 2025, Mozambique is on track to invest $128bn. But it would still be many many years before it gets over its debt crisis and begins to reap the benefit of the gas.

Anish Kapadia, managing director of Akap Energy, says, ""some of the debt was clearly fraudulently issued and then you've got the more conventional eurobonds that were issued as well. In terms of that fraudulently issued debt, there's a good chance that Mozambique may be able to get that written off ...""

""In terms of the eurobond issue, I think it makes sense for the Mozambique government to come to some kind of an agreement with the debt holders to move forward because the main thing is that Mozambique needs to be in a position where it can raise further debt going forward from really benefit from the full potential of the LNG projects in the country.""

79,Al-Nakba,Special Series,"A series on the Palestinian 'catastrophe' of 1948 that led to dispossession and conflict that still endures.

""The Nakba did not begin in 1948. Its origins lie over two centuries ago….""

So begins this four-part series on the 'nakba', meaning the 'catastrophe', about the history of the Palestinian exodus that led to the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, and the establishment of the state of Israel.

This sweeping history starts back in 1799 with Napoleon's attempted advance into Palestine to check British expansion and his appeal to the Jews of the world to reclaim their land in league with France.

The narrative moves through the 19th century and into the 20th century with the British Mandate in Palestine and comes right up to date in the 21st century and the ongoing 'nakba' on the ground.

Arab, Israeli and Western intellectuals, historians and eye-witnesses provide the central narrative which is accompanied by archive material and documents, many only recently released for the first time.

Editor's note: Since first running on Al Jazeera Arabic in 2008, this series has won Arab and international awards and has been well received at festivals throughout the world.

EPISODE ONE:

For Palestinians, 1948 marks the 'nakba' or the 'catastrophe', when hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes.

The tragedy in Palestine is not just a local one; it is a tragedy for the world, because it is an injustice that is a menace to the world's peace. Arnold Toynbee, British historian

But for Israelis, the same year marks the creation of their own state.

This series attempts to present an understanding of the events of the past that are still shaping the present.

This story starts in 1799, outside the walls of Acre in Ottoman-controlled Palestine, when an army under Napoleon Bonaparte besieged the city. It was all part of a campaign to defeat the Ottomans and establish a French presence in the region.

In search of allies, Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. He called on the Jews to ‘rise up’ against what he called their oppressors.

Napoleon’s appeal was widely publicised. But he was ultimately defeated. In Acre today, the only memory of him is a statue atop a hill overlooking the city.

Yet Napoleon's project for a Jewish homeland in the region under a colonial protectorate did not die, 40 years later, the plan was revived but by the British.

EPISODE TWO:

On 19 April 1936, the Palestinians launched a national strike to protest against mass Jewish immigration and what they saw as Britain’s alliance with the Zionist movement.

The British responded with force. During the six months of the strike, over 190 Palestinians were killed and more than 800 wounded.

Wary of popular revolt, Arab leaders advised the Palestinians to end the strike.

Palestinian leaders bowed to pressure from the Arab heads of state and agreed to meet the British Royal Commission of Inquiry headed by Lord Peel.

In its report of July 1937, the Peel Commission recommended the partition of Palestine. Its report drew the frontiers of a Jewish state in one-third of Palestine, and an Arab state in the remaining two-thirds, to be merged with Transjordan.

A corridor of land from Jerusalem to Jaffa would remain under British mandate. The Commission also recommended transferring where necessary Palestinians from the lands allocated to the new Jewish state.

The Commission's proposals were widely published and provoked heated debate.

As the Palestinian revolt continued, Britain’s response hardened. Between 1936 and 1937, the British killed over 1,000 Palestinians; 37 British military police and 69 Jews also died.

EPISODE THREE:

Few Palestinians, if any, could have imagined they were to become victims of what would later be called ""ethnic cleansing"".

When the British were preparing to leave Palestine, we didn't have weapons. My father gave me money and I bought a gun with only three bullets for 100 Palestinian liras. Sami Kamal Abdul Razek, palestinian refugee After 30 years of British rule, the question of Palestine was referred to the United Nations, which had become the forum for conflict.

On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly met to devise a plan for the partition of Palestine. UN Resolution 181 divided Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem as an internationalised city.

The Jewish state was granted 56 percent of the land; the city of Jaffa was included as an enclave of the Arab state; and the land known today as the Gaza Strip was split from its surrounding agricultural regions.

But making the proposed Arab state all but proved impractical in the eyes of many Palestinians.

When the draft resolution was presented for voting, Arab newspapers ran a 'name and shame' list of the countries that voted for the UN partition plan, and Arab protesters took to the streets.

Following the partition resolution, Britain announced it would end its mandate in Palestine on 14 May 1948.

EPISODE FOUR:

In early 1948, Jewish paramilitary forces began to seize more land in Palestine. By the end of July, more than 400,000 Palestinians had been forced to flee their homes, and their plight as refugees had just begun.

I swear to God, we tasted it; we tasted starvation like no one else did. Hosni Mohammad Smada, Palestinian refugee In May of that year, Swedish diplomat Count Folke Bernadotte had been appointed as the UN Mediator in Palestine. His mission was to seek a peaceful settlement.

The Count surveyed devastated Palestinian villages and visited refugee camps in both Palestine and Jordan. The scale of the humanitarian disaster became apparent, as he witnessed cramp living conditions, long queues for basic food and scarce medical aid.

Count Bernadotte was no stranger to human disaster; with the Red Cross he had rescued over 30,000 prisoners of war from Nazi concentration camps. Now he advocated the Palestinian's right to return to their homes.

In a report dated 16 September 1948, he wrote:

""It would be an offence against the principles of elementary justice if these innocent victims were denied the right to return to their homes, while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine, and, indeed, at least offer the threat of permanent replacement of the Arab refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries.""

The Count's first proposal argued for fixed boundaries through negotiation, an economic union between both states, and the return of Palestinian refugees - the proposal was turned down.

On 17 September, the day following his UN report, Count Bernadotte's motorcade was ambushed in Jerusalem. He was shot at point blank range by members of the Jewish Stern gang.

Al Nakba Debate:

The historic struggle for Palestine is characterised as the claims and counter-claims of Arabs and Jews, but one factor that is often overlooked behind the Palestinian 'nakba' or 'catastrophe' of 1948, is the part played by an old imperial power, Britain.

So, whose interests were best served by the British in Palestine? How did it honour its mandated duty of care? and what were the calculations and miscalculations it made in redrawing the map of Palestine, and reshaping its history?

The 65 years of the Israeli statehood, continue to cause conflict and controversy.

The history is written by the victors, who are the rewriters of history as new information, new documents, and new historians, come to light. It is time to examine how history itself is the battleground for the hearts and minds of new generations today.

To discuss the historic events that led to the 'nakba', the birth of Israel, and the making of history, we are joined by Rosemary Hollis, former head of the Middle East programme at the Royal Insitute of International Affairs; James Renton, senior lecturer in History at Edge Hill University and author of The Zionist Masquerade: The birth of the Anglo-Zionist alliance 1914-1918 ; and Avi Shalam, a professor of International Relations at Oxford University and author of the Collusion across the Jordan: King Abdullah, The Zionist Movement, and the Partition Of Palestine.

In search of allies, Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. He called on the Jews to ‘rise up’ against what he called their oppressors.

Napoleon’s appeal was widely publicised. But he was ultimately defeated. In Acre today, the only memory of him is a statue atop a hill overlooking the city.

Yet Napoleon's project for a Jewish homeland in the region under a colonial protectorate did not die, 40 years later, the plan was revived but by the British.

EPISODE TWO:

On 19 April 1936, the Palestinians launched a national strike to protest against mass Jewish immigration and what they saw as Britain’s alliance with the Zionist movement.

The British responded with force. During the six months of the strike, over 190 Palestinians were killed and more than 800 wounded.

Wary of popular revolt, Arab leaders advised the Palestinians to end the strike.

Palestinian leaders bowed to pressure from the Arab heads of state and agreed to meet the British Royal Commission of Inquiry headed by Lord Peel.

In its report of July 1937, the Peel Commission recommended the partition of Palestine. Its report drew the frontiers of a Jewish state in one-third of Palestine, and an Arab state in the remaining two-thirds, to be merged with Transjordan.

A corridor of land from Jerusalem to Jaffa would remain under British mandate. The Commission also recommended transferring where necessary Palestinians from the lands allocated to the new Jewish state.

The Commission's proposals were widely published and provoked heated debate.

As the Palestinian revolt continued, Britain’s response hardened. Between 1936 and 1937, the British killed over 1,000 Palestinians; 37 British military police and 69 Jews also died.

EPISODE THREE:

Few Palestinians, if any, could have imagined they were to become victims of what would later be called ""ethnic cleansing"".

When the British were preparing to leave Palestine, we didn't have weapons. My father gave me money and I bought a gun with only three bullets for 100 Palestinian liras. Sami Kamal Abdul Razek, palestinian refugee After 30 years of British rule, the question of Palestine was referred to the United Nations, which had become the forum for conflict.

On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly met to devise a plan for the partition of Palestine. UN Resolution 181 divided Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem as an internationalised city.

The Jewish state was granted 56 percent of the land; the city of Jaffa was included as an enclave of the Arab state; and the land known today as the Gaza Strip was split from its surrounding agricultural regions.

But making the proposed Arab state all but proved impractical in the eyes of many Palestinians.

When the draft resolution was presented for voting, Arab newspapers ran a 'name and shame' list of the countries that voted for the UN partition plan, and Arab protesters took to the streets.

Following the partition resolution, Britain announced it would end its mandate in Palestine on 14 May 1948.

EPISODE FOUR:

In early 1948, Jewish paramilitary forces began to seize more land in Palestine. By the end of July, more than 400,000 Palestinians had been forced to flee their homes, and their plight as refugees had just begun.

I swear to God, we tasted it; we tasted starvation like no one else did. Hosni Mohammad Smada, Palestinian refugee In May of that year, Swedish diplomat Count Folke Bernadotte had been appointed as the UN Mediator in Palestine. His mission was to seek a peaceful settlement.

The Count surveyed devastated Palestinian villages and visited refugee camps in both Palestine and Jordan. The scale of the humanitarian disaster became apparent, as he witnessed cramp living conditions, long queues for basic food and scarce medical aid.

Count Bernadotte was no stranger to human disaster; with the Red Cross he had rescued over 30,000 prisoners of war from Nazi concentration camps. Now he advocated the Palestinian's right to return to their homes.

In a report dated 16 September 1948, he wrote:

""It would be an offence against the principles of elementary justice if these innocent victims were denied the right to return to their homes, while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine, and, indeed, at least offer the threat of permanent replacement of the Arab refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries.""

The Count's first proposal argued for fixed boundaries through negotiation, an economic union between both states, and the return of Palestinian refugees - the proposal was turned down.

On 17 September, the day following his UN report, Count Bernadotte's motorcade was ambushed in Jerusalem. He was shot at point blank range by members of the Jewish Stern gang.

Al Nakba Debate:

The historic struggle for Palestine is characterised as the claims and counter-claims of Arabs and Jews, but one factor that is often overlooked behind the Palestinian 'nakba' or 'catastrophe' of 1948, is the part played by an old imperial power, Britain.

So, whose interests were best served by the British in Palestine? How did it honour its mandated duty of care? and what were the calculations and miscalculations it made in redrawing the map of Palestine, and reshaping its history?

The 65 years of the Israeli statehood, continue to cause conflict and controversy.

The history is written by the victors, who are the rewriters of history as new information, new documents, and new historians, come to light. It is time to examine how history itself is the battleground for the hearts and minds of new generations today.

To discuss the historic events that led to the 'nakba', the birth of Israel, and the making of history, we are joined by Rosemary Hollis, former head of the Middle East programme at the Royal Insitute of International Affairs; James Renton, senior lecturer in History at Edge Hill University and author of The Zionist Masquerade: The birth of the Anglo-Zionist alliance 1914-1918 ; and Avi Shalam, a professor of International Relations at Oxford University and author of the Collusion across the Jordan: King Abdullah, The Zionist Movement, and the Partition Of Palestine.

So begins this four-part series on the 'nakba', meaning the 'catastrophe', about the history of the Palestinian exodus that led to the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, and the establishment of the state of Israel.

This sweeping history starts back in 1799 with Napoleon's attempted advance into Palestine to check British expansion and his appeal to the Jews of the world to reclaim their land in league with France.

The narrative moves through the 19th century and into the 20th century with the British Mandate in Palestine and comes right up to date in the 21st century and the ongoing 'nakba' on the ground.

85,The Secret of the Seven Sisters,#NAME?,"On August 28, 1928, in the Scottish highlands, began the secret story of oil.



Three men had an appointment at Achnacarry Castle - a Dutchman, an American and an Englishman.



The Dutchman was Henry Deterding, a man nicknamed the Napoleon of Oil, having exploited a find in Sumatra. He joined forces with a rich ship owner and painted Shell salesman and together the two men founded Royal Dutch Shell.



The American was Walter C. Teagle and he represents the Standard Oil Company, founded by John D. Rockefeller at the age of 31 - the future Exxon. Oil wells, transport, refining and distribution of oil - everything is controlled by Standard oil.



The Englishman, Sir John Cadman, was the director of the Anglo-Persian oil Company, soon to become BP. On the initiative of a young Winston Churchill, the British government had taken a stake in BP and the Royal Navy switched its fuel from coal to oil. With fuel-hungry ships, planes and tanks, oil became ""the blood of every battle"".



The new automobile industry was developing fast, and the Ford T was selling by the million. The world was thirsty for oil, and companies were waging a merciless contest but the competition was making the market unstable.



That August night, the three men decided to stop fighting and to start sharing out the world's oil. Their vision was that production zones, transport costs, sales prices - everything would be agreed and shared. And so began a great cartel, whose purpose was to dominate the world, by controlling its oil.



Four others soon joined them, and they came to be known as the Seven Sisters - the biggest oil companies in the world.

EPISODE 1: DESERT STORMS

In the first episode, we travel across the Middle East, through both time and space.

We waged the Iran-Iraq war and I say we waged it, because one country had to be used to destroy the other. - Xavier Houzel, an oil trader

Since that notorious meeting at Achnacarry Castle on August 28, 1928, they have never ceased to plot, to plan and to scheme.

Throughout the region's modern history, since the discovery of oil, the Seven Sisters have sought to control the balance of power.



They have supported monarchies in Iran and Saudi Arabia, opposed the creation of OPEC, profiting from the Iran-Iraq war, leading to the ultimate destruction of Saddam Hussein and Iraq.



The Seven Sisters were always present, and almost always came out on top.

EPISODE 2: THE BLACK EL DORADO

At the end of the 1960s, the Seven Sisters, the major oil companies, controlled 85 percent of the world's oil reserves. Today, they control just 10 percent.

New hunting grounds are therefore required, and the Sisters have turned their gaze towards Africa. With peak oil, wars in the Middle East, and the rise in crude prices, Africa is the oil companies' new battleground.

Everybody thought there could be oil in Sudan but nobody knew anything. It was revealed through exploration by the American company Chevron, towards the end of the 70s. And that was the beginning of the second civil war, which went on until 2002. It lasted for 19 years and cost a million and a half lives and the oil business was at the heart of it. - Gerard Prunier, a historian

But the real story, the secret story of oil, begins far from Africa.

In their bid to dominate Africa, the Sisters installed a king in Libya, a dictator in Gabon, fought the nationalisation of oil resources in Algeria, and through corruption, war and assassinations, brought Nigeria to its knees.

Oil may be flowing into the holds of huge tankers, but in Lagos, petrol shortages are chronic.

The country's four refineries are obsolete and the continent's main oil exporter is forced to import refined petrol - a paradox that reaps fortunes for a handful of oil companies.

Encouraged by the companies, corruption has become a system of government - some $50bn are estimated to have 'disappeared' out of the $350bn received since independence.

But new players have now joined the great oil game.

China, with its growing appetite for energy, has found new friends in Sudan, and the Chinese builders have moved in. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir is proud of his co-operation with China - a dam on the Nile, roads, and stadiums.

In order to export 500,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields in the South - China financed and built the Heglig pipeline connected to Port Sudan - now South Sudan's precious oil is shipped through North Sudan to Chinese ports.

In a bid to secure oil supplies out of Libya, the US, the UK and the Seven Sisters made peace with the once shunned Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, until he was killed during the Libyan uprising of 2011, but the flow of Libyan oil remains uninterrupted.

In need of funds for rebuilding, Libya is now back to pumping more than a million barrels of oil per day. And the Sisters are happy to oblige.

EPISODE 3: THE DANCING BEAR

In the Caucasus, the US and Russia are vying for control of the region. The great oil game is in full swing. Whoever controls the Caucasus and its roads, controls the transport of oil from the Caspian Sea.

Tbilisi, Erevan and Baku - the three capitals of the Caucasus. The oil from Baku in Azerbaijan is a strategic priority

for all the major companies.

From the fortunes of the Nobel family to the Russian revolution, to World War II, oil from the Caucasus and the Caspian has played a central role. Lenin fixated on conquering the Azeri capital Baku for its oil, as did Stalin and Hitler.

On his birthday in 1941, Adolf Hitler received a chocolate and cream birthday cake, representing a map. He chose the slice with Baku on it.

On June 22nd 1941, the armies of the Third Reich invaded Russia. The crucial battle of Stalingrad was the key to the road to the Caucasus and Baku’s oil, and would decide the outcome of the war.

Stalin told his troops: ""Fighting for one’s oil is fighting for one’s freedom.""

After World War II, President Nikita Krushchev would build the Soviet empire and its Red Army with revenues from the USSR’s new-found oil reserves.

Decades later, oil would bring that empire to its knees, when Saudi Arabia and the US would conspire to open up the oil taps, flood the markets, and bring the price of oil down to $13 per barrel. Russian oligarchs would take up the oil mantle, only to be put in their place by their president, Vladimir Putin, who knows that oil is power.

The US and Putin‘s Russia would prop up despots, and exploit regional conflicts to maintain a grip on the oil fields of the Caucusus and the Caspian.

But they would not have counted on the rise of a new, strong and hungry China, with an almost limitless appetite for oil and energy. Today, the US, Russia and China contest the control of the former USSR’s fossil fuel reserves, and the supply routes. A three-handed match, with the world as spectators, between three ferocious beasts – The American eagle, the Russian bear, and the Chinese dragon.

EPISODE 4: A TIME FOR LIES

Peak oil – the point in time at which the highest rate of oil extraction has been reached, and after which world production will start decline. Many geologists and the International Energy Agency say the world's crude oil output reached its peak in 2006.

But while there may be less oil coming out of the ground, the demand for it is definitely on the rise.

The final episode of this series explores what happens when oil becomes more and more inaccessible, while at the same time, new powers like China and India try to fulfill their growing energy needs.

And countries like Iran, while suffering international sanctions, have welcomed these new oil buyers, who put business ahead of lectures on human rights and nuclear ambitions.

At the same time, oil-producing countries have had enough with the Seven Sisters controlling their oil assets. Nationalisation of oil reserves around the world has ushered in a new generation of oil companies all vying for a slice of the oil pie.

These are the new Seven Sisters:

Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco, the largest and most sophisticated oil company in the world; Russia's Gazprom, a company that Russia's President Vladimir Putin wrested away from the oligarchs; The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which, along with its subsidiary, Petrochina, is the world's secnd largest company in terms of market value; The National Iranian Oil Company, which has a monopoly on exploration, extraction, transportation and exportation of crude oil in Iran – OPEC's second largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia; Venezuela's PDVSA, a company the late president Hugo Chavez dismantled and rebuilt into his country's economic engine and part of his diplomatic arsenal; Brazil's Petrobras, a leader in deep water oil production, that pumps out 2 million barrels of crude oil a day; and Malaysia's Petronas - Asia's most profitable company in 2012.

Mainly state-owned, the new Seven Sisters control a third of the world's oil and gas production, and more than a third of the world's reserves. The old Seven Sisters, by comparison, produce a tenth of the world's oil, and control only three percent of the reserves.

The balance has shifted.

86,The Secret of the Seven Sisters,An Oil Trader,"On August 28, 1928, in the Scottish highlands, began the secret story of oil.



Three men had an appointment at Achnacarry Castle - a Dutchman, an American and an Englishman.



The Dutchman was Henry Deterding, a man nicknamed the Napoleon of Oil, having exploited a find in Sumatra. He joined forces with a rich ship owner and painted Shell salesman and together the two men founded Royal Dutch Shell.



The American was Walter C. Teagle and he represents the Standard Oil Company, founded by John D. Rockefeller at the age of 31 - the future Exxon. Oil wells, transport, refining and distribution of oil - everything is controlled by Standard oil.



The Englishman, Sir John Cadman, was the director of the Anglo-Persian oil Company, soon to become BP. On the initiative of a young Winston Churchill, the British government had taken a stake in BP and the Royal Navy switched its fuel from coal to oil. With fuel-hungry ships, planes and tanks, oil became ""the blood of every battle"".

Stalin told his troops: ""Fighting for one’s oil is fighting for one’s freedom.""

After World War II, President Nikita Krushchev would build the Soviet empire and its Red Army with revenues from the USSR’s new-found oil reserves.

Decades later, oil would bring that empire to its knees, when Saudi Arabia and the US would conspire to open up the oil taps, flood the markets, and bring the price of oil down to $13 per barrel. Russian oligarchs would take up the oil mantle, only to be put in their place by their president, Vladimir Putin, who knows that oil is power.

The US and Putin‘s Russia would prop up despots, and exploit regional conflicts to maintain a grip on the oil fields of the Caucusus and the Caspian.

But they would not have counted on the rise of a new, strong and hungry China, with an almost limitless appetite for oil and energy. Today, the US, Russia and China contest the control of the former USSR’s fossil fuel reserves, and the supply routes. A three-handed match, with the world as spectators, between three ferocious beasts – The American eagle, the Russian bear, and the Chinese dragon.

EPISODE 4: A TIME FOR LIES

Peak oil – the point in time at which the highest rate of oil extraction has been reached, and after which world production will start decline. Many geologists and the International Energy Agency say the world's crude oil output reached its peak in 2006.

But while there may be less oil coming out of the ground, the demand for it is definitely on the rise.

The final episode of this series explores what happens when oil becomes more and more inaccessible, while at the same time, new powers like China and India try to fulfill their growing energy needs.

And countries like Iran, while suffering international sanctions, have welcomed these new oil buyers, who put business ahead of lectures on human rights and nuclear ambitions.

At the same time, oil-producing countries have had enough with the Seven Sisters controlling their oil assets. Nationalisation of oil reserves around the world has ushered in a new generation of oil companies all vying for a slice of the oil pie.

These are the new Seven Sisters:

Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco, the largest and most sophisticated oil company in the world; Russia's Gazprom, a company that Russia's President Vladimir Putin wrested away from the oligarchs; The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which, along with its subsidiary, Petrochina, is the world's secnd largest company in terms of market value; The National Iranian Oil Company, which has a monopoly on exploration, extraction, transportation and exportation of crude oil in Iran – OPEC's second largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia; Venezuela's PDVSA, a company the late president Hugo Chavez dismantled and rebuilt into his country's economic engine and part of his diplomatic arsenal; Brazil's Petrobras, a leader in deep water oil production, that pumps out 2 million barrels of crude oil a day; and Malaysia's Petronas - Asia's most profitable company in 2012.

Mainly state-owned, the new Seven Sisters control a third of the world's oil and gas production, and more than a third of the world's reserves. The old Seven Sisters, by comparison, produce a tenth of the world's oil, and control only three percent of the reserves.

The balance has shifted.

89,I Knew Mandela,Special Series,"Who was the man behind the legend? We get an insight into Nelson Mandela's life through the eyes of people who knew him

""If we did not have a Mandela … the history of this country would be different,"" said Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's second wife.

He had a face recognised by millions, a reputation admired worldwide, and a style all of his own. But who was the man behind the legend?

Nelson Rolihlahla was born in 1918 in a small village in South Africa.

His name meant 'troublemaker', one who stirs things up. Later South Africans would call him Madiba, his clan name and an affectionate nickname.

His father died when he was nine years old. He went to stay with his uncle, a royal chief. Seeing the chief dispense justice set in motion a lifetime desire to fight for equality and democracy.

At university he studied law but his political activities got him expelled, so he moved to Johannesburg where he joined the African National Congress (ANC), a political party opposed to South Africa's racial segregation.

Known as 'apartheid' this system of government legally allowed for discrimination against non-whites. ""He was the leader deliberately chosen by the ANC to be a symbol of resistance,"" Winnie Mandela said.

Mandela played an active and vocal role opposing the policies of South Africa's nationalist government. He took his activities underground in the 1960s, but was soon arrested, convicted of sabotage and treason and imprisoned for life.

He was released 27 years later, and was at the forefront of ushering in a new democratic dawn for the country.

Mandela helped build a new image for South Africa and although he spent the last years of his life away from the public eye, he will always be remembered as a man who inspired the world.

""The world needs symbols, the world needs to highlight the best of values we can find in certain human beings, we deliberately, minimise his weaknesses and we minimise his vulnerabilities because that's what counts. We even overvalue what he means in goodness,"" says Graca Machel, his third wife, who he lived with until his death in 2013.

Al Jazeera talks to Nelson Mandela's family and the people who met him, to uncover the life of a legend who, in many ways, changed how South Africa is viewed by others and by itself.

96,How to pitch to Al Jazeera.com,Aj Labs,"The in-depth department of the Al Jazeera English website receives somewhere in the region of 100 pitches a week. These may be for written features, long-reads, interactives, photo-essays or videos. If your pitch is time-sensitive and requires a quick response, please clearly say so. We will then endeavour to respond promptly. Otherwise, your pitch will be considered in a weekly pitch meeting when members of each team will get together to sift through all of the pitches they have received, and make decisions about those they wish to commission. This may not always be a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision. We may like the story you’ve pitched but not the way you plan to tell it. Or we may realise that you’d be the perfect person to tell a different story we have in mind. We understand that waiting can be frustrating. But giving us the time to give proper consideration to your pitch not only gives it a better shot at being commissioned, it also means that it is more likely to end up in front of the best editor for your story — we all have different strengths and interests — and to receive the most thorough treatment. Remember that this is just the beginning of your working relationship with an editor. The same editor who fights for your pitch to be commissioned during the pitch meeting — and with limited slots and budget available, this will sometimes involve just that — will likely be the editor who commissions you, works with you to develop the brief for your story and then eventually edits the final version, going back and forth with you to ensure that it is the best it can possibly be. Even if your pitch isn’t accepted, it can be the beginning of a good working relationship. A rejection isn’t always a reflection of the quality of the pitch. We may have just commissioned something on the same topic the week before or your piece may miss out because there are simply more pressing stories at the time. But there are a few things you can do to give your pitch the best chance of being accepted. We’ve compiled the tips below from different editors and hope they help.

Be clear Your pitch needs to be easily understood. The way you pitch will tell us a lot about the way you write: Can you guide us confidently and concisely through the information we’ll need to make a decision — the what, when, where, why and who of your story? If you can do that in a pitch, we are more likely to trust that you can do that in a story. But if you leave us baffled and feeling unsure about what exactly your story is, alarm bells may start to ring. Think like a storyteller Now, if you can do the above and intrigue or excite us, you are in with a good shot of being commissioned. And nothing intrigues and excites an editor more than somebody with a great sense of story. You’ve told us what your story is, now tell us how you plan to tell it. Who will your characters be and how will their stories shed light on the topic? Where will your story be set and what kind of colour and detail can we expect? Something interesting to keep in mind is that at Al Jazeera, we’ll take a writer who is an excellent storyteller but whose language may need some work over somebody with impeccable English but little sense of story every time. We can polish your words, reconstruct your sentences and tweak your grammar, but we can’t portray to the reader the depth of emotion, the sights and the sounds of a mother relaying how she lost her baby because she couldn’t afford medical care — that’s up to the writer to deliver. Throw the formulas out Many potentially great stories — compelling stories, the sorts of stories that stay with you long after you have finished reading them — have been lost to the same old formula of storytelling — the one that tells you how to structure a feature, regardless of the content of that story. Okay, this formula works — sometimes. And there are certain checks and balances it provides that shouldn’t be abandoned. But it isn’t always the best way to tell a story. As a writer, ask yourself how you can best communicate this story to really do justice to it. It may be a conventional feature with plenty of voices and a little colour, but it may equally be a first person, a portrait, a letter, a video story, a photo essay.

Suggest this in your pitch. Your commissioning editor may have other ideas. But they will always appreciate the fact that you are thinking creatively, and it could be the start of a conversation that will really bring the best out of your story. How is this an Al Jazeera story? So, what is an Al Jazeera story? It’s about the topic, in part. Does this story give a ‘voice to the voiceless’? If it does, that’s a good start. Does it question dominant, mainstream narratives? That’s also important. But it is also about more than that. The way you tell a story also helps to determine whether it is an Al Jazeera story. Because you can talk to the ‘voiceless’ without necessarily giving them a ‘voice’. The way you approach your storytelling is almost as critical as the stories you choose to tell. Where is the balance of power in your story, with you as the narrator, the journalist, the storyteller or with the characters in your story? Persevere

Getting to tell stories that you care about, important stories that people need to read, is a privilege. So, even if one of your pitches is turned down, persevere.

Telling important stories beautifully is as important to your editor as it is to you, so they won’t mind you asking for feedback on how to improve.","The in-depth department of the Al Jazeera English website receives somewhere in the region of 100 pitches a week.

101,How Trump's tariff threat against Mexico might backfire,Ben Piven,"The clock is ticking on the threat by United States President Donald Trump to slap five-percent tariffs on a wide variety of Mexican goods - from avocados and grapes to blue jeans and car parts - if Mexico does not do more to stem the flow of undocumented migrants trying to enter the US.

Officials from both countries have been engaged in diplomatic talks in Washington, DC, trying to strike a last-minute deal before import taxes on Mexico are scheduled to take effect on Monday.

While the president has staked his political capital on the idea that punitive trade measures can force the US's southern neighbour to implement overnight changes to migration policy, economists are warning the strategy could backfire.

""The great irony of this presidential action is - if it inflicts heavy damage on the [Mexican] economy, more unemployed Mexicans will migrate north for better employment opportunities here,"" said Dan Griswold, a senior research fellow for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Griswold noted that using tariffs to force concessions from trading partners ""hasn't brought any progress in our relations with China"" and added that if the US slaps tariffs on Mexico, it will harm both economies.

""Trade is a win-win. Trade wars are lose-lose,"" he said. That means ""higher prices and lost exports for Americans, while Mexico will pay a heavier price, as most of their exports go to the US"".

Calling tariffs a ""bizarre policy choice"" for tackling migration issues, Griswold told Al Jazeera that Trump ""should back away as soon as possible"".

Economic pain, political gain

If tariffs are imposed on Monday, the fallout will rain down on both the US and Mexican economies, but to different degrees.

""Mexico will be the hardest hit"" by tariffs, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

""Probably a recession [will occur] if the tariffs go above 15 percent,"" he told Al Jazeera, referring to the rounds of additional five-percent monthly hikes that Trump has promised, capping out at 25 percent by October if the dispute remains unresolved.

""US consumers will pay $1,700 per household of three persons if tariffs reach 25 percent,"" Hufbauer warned, predicting that cars could become $5,000 more expensive within five months, while prices on medical supplies and electronics could rise significantly.

""Fruits and vegetables will be noticeably more expensive at the supermarket,"" he said, adding that if Mexico retaliates with tariffs on US goods, ""US corn, chicken, pork and beef farmers"" will be squeezed.

As costs rise for US consumers and businesses, it could have a chilling effect on the labour market, and result in the loss of up to 400,000 US jobs, especially in the manufacturing and retail sectors, according to a study by the Perryman Group.

But some economists see Trump's tariff threat against Mexico as the logical evolution of tactics that won him the White House.

Francisco Gonzalez, associate professor of political economy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said tariffs would be the culmination of a years-long effort by Trump to construct an electoral platform - and a border wall - scapegoating Mexico for the declining fortunes of the US middle class.

""The president has been talking about this since before he was elected,"" Gonzalez told Al Jazeera. ""The strategy is rational and follows a clear script that gave him victory.""

""And given that things have not changed dramatically [in the US] - the lower-middle class and working classes have not seen major [improvements] in their livelihood - this message continues to carry a lot of political dynamite,"" Gonzalez said. ""People continue to support him regardless.""

""Trump is not breaking up a relationship with the Mexican government, because he doesn't have one,"" said Gonzalez. ""It's basically about refocusing attention on the border and on immigration.""

In terms of economic toll, Gonzalez agrees that ""first and worst [impacted] are Mexican producers and consumers. Then second, American consumers. Third, American producers sending stuff to Mexico, [but they] won't be taxed [until] it comes back to the US.""

Many goods cross the border a half-dozen times before reaching consumers, since supply chains snake across the border.

Despite their ire, some members of the US Congress - and others who want to see business as usual - will be energised to fight against nativism and the protectionist ""assault on free trade"", Gonzalez suggested.

With many lawmakers deeply concerned about the impact of tariffs on states such as Texas, Arizona and Michigan, legislators could attempt to override the president's trade authority to act under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. But both houses of the US Congress would need to muster veto-proof two-thirds majorities to nullify the tariffs.

Migration policy trumps trade?

""If I had to guess, there's a good chance tariffs will be walked back [by Trump],"" said Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. But he suggested that might happen only after a round or two is levied, and ripple effects begin to spread across the economy.

""[Tariffs] were pushed by the immigration wing in the White House - not the trade and economy wing,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Traditional pro-trade Republicans think this policy is a big mistake.""

Many analysts agree that using the trade cudgel to force drastic changes from Mexico is not a robust formula.

The linkage likely will not be effective, they say, because the problem of Central American migration is so deep-rooted and complex that the Mexican government could not solve the issue - even if it wanted to - simply by allocating more resources.

In addition, the government of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador remains in a weak fiscal position, having been in power for just six months. Observers say the president is cutting social services and focusing on petrol sector investments, with few funds to spare for migration enforcement.

For its part, Mexico has begun to accept more asylum seekers and police its perilous frontier regions. And Lopez Obrador's administration has tried to manage the situation carefully, without alienating the US.

A possible agreement discussed by negotiators involves the border deployment of 6,000 Mexican troops, and a change in asylum rules requiring migrants to seek refuge in the first foreign country they enter.

But Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Wednesday that Mexico could avert tariffs only by taking in all asylum seekers, completely sealing off the southern border with Guatemala, and strengthening security checkpoints throughout Mexico.

Trump himself - in vague but far-reaching language - has demanded that Mexico halt all ""illegal immigration"".

Meanwhile, the US has already sent Department of Homeland Security personnel to the Guatemalan side of the Mexican border.

Critics of the Trump administration's approach suggest that the US should do more to fix its own flailing asylum system, adding more judges and border facilities to handle the influx of people - which hit a seven-year high in May.

Migration has been increasing sharply, with Washington unable to stop the arrival of hundreds of thousands of impoverished labourers, women and children.

USMCA stuck

As the freshly minted United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) still needs ratification by all three national legislatures, some economists warn that a seemingly endless string of tariff increases on the horizon could jeopardise implementation, and by extension, the global competitiveness of all three economies.

""We have a North American economy, not separate US, Canadian and Mexican ones. [People and] things flow back and forth,"" Claude Barfield, a trade policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute told Al Jazeera.

Barfield said that US trade issues with Mexico are minor when put into global perspective, and that assessing import taxes ""on parts of a door for a Buick or a Ford makes US companies less competitive"".

""We should be doing something more targeted and precise,"" he said. “Tariffs have a downside, and [Trump is] lying when he says [the] US doesn't pay for it.""

Barfield added that tariffs also harm the poor and working classes disproportionately. ""People with less income spend more of it on basics,"" he said.

190606181047401

Mercatus' Griswold said tariffs would be a ""huge setback for the passage of the USMCA, the administration's top legislative priority for the year"".

""It poisons relations with Congress on both sides of the aisle, sours enthusiasm for the agreement in Mexico, and casts doubt on America as a reliable negotiations partner,"" he said. ""The 'new NAFTA' [North American Free Trade Agreement] is supposed to supply certainty, and what the president is doing is maximum uncertainty.""

Griswold said US credibility would be harmed, signaling to ""lots of other countries"" that a deal with the US is ""not worth the paper it's written on"".

""Trump is mixing two entirely different policy areas: immigration and trade,"" Griswold added. ""And he's getting them both wrong.""","""Mexico will be the hardest hit"" by tariffs, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
