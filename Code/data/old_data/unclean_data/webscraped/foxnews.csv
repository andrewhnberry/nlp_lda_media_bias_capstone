0,Watch: Dramatic moment US warship almost collides with Russian destroyer in Philippine Sea,Lucas Tomlinson,"The U.S. Navy has released footage of the dramatic moment one of its warships almost collided with a Russian destroyer in the Philippine Sea.

The USS Chancellorsville, a guided-missile cruiser, nearly struck the Udaloy I DD 572 when it made an ""unsafe maneuver"", coming within 50 to 100 feet, according to the Navy's 7th Fleet in a statement.

“This unsafe action forced Chancellorsville to execute all engines back full and to maneuver to avoid collision,” said the Navy’s 7th Fleet in a statement.

The Navy subsequently released video and a satellite image showing the two vessels sailing perilously close to one another.

RUSSIA CLAIMS TO TEST FIRE NEW HYPERSONIC INTERCEPTOR MISSILE

The incident happened at 11:45 am Friday in the Philippine Sea, according to the statement.

Russian state media had claimed that the U.S. cruiser had ""hindered the passage"" of the Admiral Vinogradov anti-submarine destroyer about 160 feet in front of it, forcing them to perform a dangerous maneuver in the southeastern part of the East China Sea. But the U.S. dismissed their version of events as ""propaganda""

It’s the second time in three days the U.S. Navy has accused Russian forces of dangerous maneuvers after a Russian fighter jet flew dangerously close to a Navy reconnaissance aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean.

The near collision between American and Russian warships comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted his Chinese counterpart at the Kremlin.

""We consider Russia's actions during this interaction as unsafe and unprofessional and not in accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), 'Rules of the Road,' and internationally recognized maritime customs,"" the 7th Fleet said.

President Trump’s acting defense secretary said Friday the U.S. government would lodge a formal protest over the incident with the Russian Navy.

“We’ll have military to military conversations with the Russians, and of course we’ll demarche them. To me, it’s safety that is most important. It will not deter us when conducting our operations,"" Patrick Shanahan told reporters on the Pentagon steps ahead of a meeting with his Greek counterpart.

The latest incident comes just days after the Navy accused a Russian fighter jet of buzzing a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the Mediterranean Sea three times.

The U.S. P-8A Poseidon aircraft was flying in international airspace at the time of the intercepts Tuesday, Navy officials added.

The developments come as the U.S. Navy is set to kick off a series of war games in the Baltic Sea with other NATO nations.

The Pentagon had mulled over pulling thousands of Marines from the exercise - known as BALTOPS - to send to the Middle East in a warning to Iran, but in the end, top officials thought the American forces were needed to send a message to Russia.

1,"Fox News exclusive: Trump launches blistering attack on 'nasty, vindictive, horrible' Pelosi",Liam Quinn,"President Trump has taken the gloves off in his ongoing feud with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in Normandy, France, in an interview that aired Thursday, the president first took time to pay tribute to the heroes who fought on D-Day 75 years ago, describing them as “incredibly brave people” who displayed incredible “valor.”

Then, the president switched gears, slamming Pelosi, D-Calif., as a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” -- after saying he had “tried to be nice to her.”

“I think she’s a disgrace. I actually don’t think she’s a talented person, I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done,” Trump said on “The Ingraham Angle.”

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them.”

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP SAYS MUELLER MADE A 'FOOL' OF HIMSELF

Trump then referenced former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, suggesting some Democrats hoped it would give them the so-called silver bullet to take him down.

“They thought their good friend Bobby Mueller was going to give them a great report and he came out with a report with 13 horrible, angry Democrats who are totally biased against me,” the president told Ingraham.

“A couple of them worked for Hillary Clinton, they then added five more, also Democrats. With all of that, two-and-a-half years, think of it, from before I even got elected, they’ve been going after me and they have nothing.”

Ingraham then asked Trump if he cared whether or not Mueller would testify publicly about his report. The president used the question as another chance to unload on Pelosi.

“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself the last time she -- because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong but Nancy Pelosi, I call her nervous Nancy, Nancy Pelosi doesn’t talk about it,” Trump told Fox News.

“Nancy Pelosi’s a disaster, OK, she’s a disaster and let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they’re in big trouble because when you look at the kind of crimes that were committed, and I don’t need any more evidence, and I guess from what I’m hearing there’s a lot of evidence coming in.

“And then ask Nancy, why is her district [having] drug needles all over the place? It’s the most disgusting thing what she’s allowed to happen to her district, with needles, with drug addicts... with people living on the sidewalk.”

Trump continued, referencing Pelosi’s reported comment to fellow top Democrats that she would like to see him in “prison.”

“It was a horrible, nasty, vicious statement while I’m overseas... She didn’t want to – she is a terrible person and I’ll tell you her name, it’s nervous Nancy because she’s a nervous wreck.”

Pelosi, as Politico reported, made the remark while defending her stance against impeaching the president in an evening meeting with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other top Democrats.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” she said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., also reportedly attended the meeting.

Trump also discussed his potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, during his interview with Ingraham.

After being asked about Biden downplaying the potential threat of China to the U.S. at a recent town-hall event, Trump said: “He just doesn't get it, he just doesn't get it.”

“How happy would President Xi be to have Joe Biden be the nominee of the Democratic party,” Ingraham followed up, to which the president replied: “Well he wants him, he wants him.”

Elsewhere during the president’s wide-ranging interview with Ingraham, he said Mueller made “such a fool” out of himself last week when he delivered his first and only public statement about the Russia investigation.

“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself ... because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong,” Trump told Ingraham.

Trump was referring to Mueller’s initial suggestion that the president was not charged with an obstruction-of-justice offense because of longstanding Justice Department policy.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said last week, citing an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion stating that a sitting president could not be indicted.

“If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. ... We concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said.

3,Illinois bishop: No communion for lawmakers who backed ‘abominable’ abortion bill,Caleb Parke,"An Illinois bishop who calls an abortion bill passed by the state legislature ""extreme"" issued a decree Thursday that no lawmakers who supported it will be able to receive communion for ""promoting the abominable crime and very grave sin of abortion.""

Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan and state Senate President John Cullerton, both Catholics who pushed for The Reproductive Health Act, a sweeping abortion rights bill that repeals several restrictions on abortions, have been banned from partaking in the sacrament of communion at Mass in the Springfield diocese.

The bill, approved last Friday, is awaiting the governor's signature.

LIBERALS MOVE TO PURGE PRO-LIFE DEMS FROM PARTY, AMID FUROR OVER ABORTION LAWS

Bishop Thomas Paprocki of the Diocese of Springfield, Ill., which includes the state's capital, said pro-abortion lawmakers who supported the bill that removes waiting periods, spousal consent and criminal penalties for doctors who perform abortions, are promoting a position that is ""inconsistent with being a good Catholic, a faithful Catholic.""

""We have to be clear that you cannot be pro-abortion and be a Catholic in good standing,"" Paprocki told the National Catholic Register. ""And that’s what this is really intended to do.""

PRIEST GETS BACKLASH FOR TELLING 'LADIES' TO DRESS MODESTLY AT MASS TO PROTECT THE 'PURITY OF MEN'

Madigan said he was notified by Paprocki that if he backed the bill he would not be able to take communion, but he backed it anyway, adding in a statement the bill is ""a recognition that women across Illinois deserve access to health care without intrusion from the government.""

While the Church's position is clear, not all Catholic leaders agree with Paprocki, who added that he was not doing it to punish them but to encourage them to have a change of heart.

JOE BIDEN REVERSES STANCE ON HYDE AMENDMENT, ANNOUNCES OPPOSITION AMID 2020 OUTCRY

Father Michael Pfleger, a priest in the Archdiocese of Chicago, said he's entering a ""dangerous area"" in deciding who should and should not take communion based on political stances. Father Thomas Hurley accused Paprocki of ""using Holy Communion as a weapon.""

The Thomas More Society, a pro-life group, told Fox News the bill will make Illinois the ""abortion capital of America.""

5,Trade union holds up Silicon Valley residential project over potential threat to birds,Lukas Mikelionis,"A California trade union is seeking to block a major residential construction project in the heart of housing-starved Silicon Valley, claiming there will be a bloodbath of birds due to the proposed building's reflective windows.

The Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA), which represents construction workers in Sunnyvale -- a city of about 140,000 residents between Stanford University and downtown San Jose -- has sued the city and its council over the project.

The union claims that the approved 1,051-unit residential project, sponsored by the Irvine Company, may cause permanent damage to the environment and thus must be scrapped, Reason magazine reported.

The project would tear down office buildings in an industrial area and instead build apartments and townhouses, providing desperately needed affordable housing in the area. More than half the units would also be rented at below-market prices to people on lower incomes.

But the union’s lawsuit says that unless additional environmental review is conducted, the project will cause damage to residents and wildlife. The lawsuit notes that birds will be killed as the proposed project features reflective windows.

According to the outlet, the trade union is using the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law mandating government agencies to study potential environmental impacts, to disrupt the project. Rather than protecting the environment, the decades-old law has been used by interested groups in the past to ensure unwanted projects don’t get off the ground.

The trade union’s chapter in Los Angeles is even accused of precisely that – filing frivolous CEQA complaints to a building project to ensure the company in charge of it hires all-union labor. The developer, Icon, says the union’s actions violate federal racketeering laws, according to the outlet.

The Sunnyvale union says that more than 500 birds would die by flying into the project's reflective windows, while the residents’ cats could also increase this number even further, causing serious environmental damage.

It remains unclear whether the city will stave off the legal challenge.

7,"Silicon Valley in the crosshairs: Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple face bipartisan onslaught",Christopher Carbone,"Big Tech's moment of reckoning has finally arrived.

After years of expansion and disruption, while seeming to escape regulatory scrutiny relatively unscathed in the United States, the world's most powerful tech companies are suddenly staring down the barrel of a bipartisan gun that could severely curtail their growth, subject them to invasive probes, saddle them with new regulations and potentially force them to break up.

In recent days, antitrust investigators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have set their sights on four of the largest players in Silicon Valley: Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The two U.S. agencies have reportedly decided to divide and conquer, with the Justice Department taking the lead on investigating Google, while the FTC is set to examine the practices of Amazon.

Facebook, which came to an agreement with the FTC in 2011, has been rumored to be close to a new deal with the agency that would subject it to billions in fines and new regulatory oversight around privacy. Apple would fall under the purview of the Justice Department, which has a history with the Cupertino, Calif. company. The Justice Department found in 2014 that Apple engaged in a conspiracy with five publishers to increase the price of ebooks, ultimately costing the company $450 million.

""This is more of a warning to the companies that they’re being carefully scrutinized and they need to be careful not to play fast and loose given their dominant positions in the digital marketplace,"" Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department who is now president of the consumer group Public Knowledge, told The New York Times.

The antitrust scrutiny comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have vowed to curtail the power of Big Tech, which critics say has stifled competition and innovation while allowing the spread of misinformation and hate speech. A number of Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination have called for greater regulation of Silicon Valley but Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. has put forth the most aggressive proposal to break up several tech giants on antitrust grounds.

The House Judiciary Committee on Monday announced a bipartisan investigation that will use the power of subpoenas and public testimony to focus on three key areas: documenting competition problems in digital markets; examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies and current enforcement levels are adequate to addresses the issues.

""Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy – especially when digital platforms control content. The era of self-regulation is over,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement on Twitter, adding that the probe is ""long overdue.""

Shares of Facebook and Alphabet, which owns Google, both tumbled on Monday, pulling the Nasdaq Composite Index into correction territory.

'WHITE COLLAR SWEATSHOP': GOOGLE ASSISTANT CONTRACTORS SLAM TECH GIANT

""Technology has become a crucial part of Americans' everyday lives,"" said Antitrust Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner, R-WI, in a statement. ""As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition.""

The tech industry poured $77.9 million into lobbying U.S. lawmakers in 2018, compared with $16.4 million a decade earlier, The Wall Street Journal reports. Both Google and Amazon have also funded more than 30 nonprofit groups, including think tanks on the left and the right, that have a voice in the public debate over antitrust, according to the Journal.

However, all of that money may not be enough to stave off regulators and investigators.

People familiar with the investigations told Reuters that neither the Justice Department nor the FTC has contacted Google or Amazon about any probes, and that company executives are unaware of what issues regulators are reviewing.

The world's largest online retailer, Amazon, has faced heat for the power it wields over third-party sellers on its platform -- in part from the sale of its private label products. The Seattle-based tech giant has also been criticized for damaging traditional retailers, although government regulators did allow its purchase of Whole Foods to proceed in 2017. Amazon has pointed out in the past that Walmart, its biggest American competitor, saw its online sales grow 40 percent last year and that 90 percent of all retail sales in the U.S. still happen in bricks-and-mortar stores.

Apple is being examined by the European Union thanks to a complaint from streaming music company Spotify that Apple has abused its power over app downloads. Although Apple has frequently touted the privacy of its hardware and taken subtle shots at Facebook, a new report suggests that a range of different iPhone apps are sending out users' information to third parties. The Tim Cook-led company recently announced that it was killing iTunes. Cook pushed back on antitrust arguments, telling CBS News on Tuesday that his company is ""not a monopoly.""

In April, Facebook said it expects to be fined up to $5 billion by the FTC, which has been probing the social network's role in sharing the data of 87 million of its users with the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica. The Menlo Park, Calif. company, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has been slammed by critics over the proliferation of fake news on its platform. However, Zuckerberg announced this year that Facebook would pivot to focus more on privacy and encrypted communication, and the company has dramatically increased its investments in AI and hired thousands of workers focused on health and safety.

“We’re still waiting on long overdue FTC action on Facebook’s violated consent decree,” Sarah Miller, co-chair of Freedom From Facebook, a group which has called for the social network to be broken up, said in a statement to Fox News via email. “Facebook’s violation of the consent decree already gives the FTC grounds to break up Facebook’s monopoly, and they should. But, a potential bigger-picture antitrust investigation is also long overdue.""

The FTC previously settled an investigation into Google in 2013 with a reprimand, but the Sundar Pichai-led firm has been fined multiple times by European regulators in recent years for anticompetitive practices. According to ad research firm eMarketer, Google is expected to capture 37 percent of the $129 billion spent on online ads in the U.S. in 2019, compared to 22 percent for Facebook and 10 percent for Amazon.

""After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is vital for Congress to step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct platform gatekeepers or if we need new legislation,"" said Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-RI, in a statement.

Still, not everyone agrees that Silicon Valley's biggest tech companies should be broken up.

“The Justice Department’s investigation of Google will come to the same conclusion as the FTC’s did in 2013 -- that there is no antitrust case,” said Carl Szabo, VP of NetChoice, an e-commerce trade association, in a statement to Fox News. ""It’s illogical that the DOJ is investigating competitors in the same market for monopoly behavior. Amazon, Apple, and Google all compete with each other in a vibrant and competitive marketplace.""

Google, Facebook and Amazon did not comment on the record for this story. Fox News also reached out to Apple.","In recent days, antitrust investigators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have set their sights on four of the largest players in Silicon Valley: Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.
Apple would fall under the purview of the Justice Department, which has a history with the Cupertino, Calif. company.
The Justice Department found in 2014 that Apple engaged in a conspiracy with five publishers to increase the price of ebooks, ultimately costing the company $450 million.

8,San Francisco to force treatment for mentally ill drug addicts amid criticism plan violates civil rights,Travis Fedschun,"Officials in San Francisco decided Tuesday to back a plan allowing the city to force some people with serious mental illness and drug addiction issues into treatment -- but the program is coming under intense criticism in uber-liberal California for what some say is a deprivation of individual civil liberties.

The city's Board of Supervisors voted 10-1 on the proposal for a pilot program after months of debate, which initially would apply to a handful of people, pending legislation at the state level, and then could expand.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed and other supporters of the plan -- which is known as conservatorship — say it is necessary to help people who are often homeless, addicted to drugs or mentally ill and either have no means or no desire to get off the streets, which the plan's proponents say makes them a danger to themselves and others.

“This is an important step that will help people on our streets get the treatment they need rather than continuing to cycle in and out of the emergency room, and often the criminal justice system,” Breed said in a statement after the vote. “Conservatorship will allow us to finally break this cycle by providing sustained care, which is why we are also expanding our treatment beds and other resources to address the issues that these individuals face.""

HOMELESSNESS JUMPS 12 PERCENT ACROSS LOS ANGELES COUNTY DESPITE $619M IN SPENDING

The pilot program would allow a court to appoint a public conservator for someone who has been involuntarily detained for psychiatric hospitalization at least eight times in a year, with treatments that could last for as long as a year. It also included a proposal by Breed for more money to fund additional beds in treatment centers.

The city has long suffered from exorbitant rent costs, pricing out large swathes of even working professionals, nevermind those living below the poverty line. It also has seen a recent surge in the number of homeless people — some with disturbing behavior tied to drugs, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. They shuffle from the streets to jail and psychiatric care, unaware they need steady treatment, sometimes dashing into traffic or screaming at strangers.

""What you see on our streets, what you see playing itself out on the street is a crisis,"" Breed told KTVU before the vote. ""And we have to do something a lot different than we have in the past.""

State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, co-authored state legislation that allows the pilot programs in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego counties. He is working on changing the legislation to expand the number of people affected.

""Too many people are deteriorating and dying on San Francisco's streets, and we have a moral responsibility to help them,"" he said in a statement after the vote. ""It's neither progressive nor compassionate to stand by while people die. We need to offer voluntary services to those in need. But for people incapable of accepting services, we need to consider helping them via conservatorship.""

Only about five people could be forced into treatment in San Francisco under the newly-passed plan, according to Rachael Kagan, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Public Health. But Wiener's new bill could bump that up to 55, which is the number of people who now fit the definition for at least involuntary holds. San Francisco's health department has identified an additional 48 people on the fringe who have been involuntarily detained six or seven times.

Supervisor Shamann Walton was the lone ""no"" vote against the plan, telling the San Francisco Chronicle he was concerned about how it could affect the city's African-American population and noted police officers are often the ones to initiate temporary psychiatric holds.

“For me it is still troubling to note that, typically, policies that force individuals into a scenario where their freedom is taken, tends to affect black people and people of color disproportionately,” he told the paper.

Critics of the proposal have said that, despite good intentions, conservatorship means stripping people of their rights to make decisions for themselves, which goes against the progressive principals of the city. They also say, practically, it would lead to locking up people in facilities that San Francisco lacks the resources for.

""We are concerned about ensuring that persons receive mental health treatment and services in their communities, in supportive housing, in supportive environments — and not in facilities,"" Curt Child, legislative director of Disability Rights California, told the Associated Press. ""This is a major civil rights issue in the sense of confining people against their will.""

The San Francisco pilot plan appeared to also contradict a message by California Gov. Gavin Newsom over the weekend at the California Democratic Convention, where he boasted that ""California’s what happens when rights are respected. When work is rewarded. When nature’s protected. When diversity is celebrated and free markets are fair markets.""

Homeless advocates have also raised concerns over plans that may expand the number of people that fall under expanded conservatorship.

“Pretty disheartening, when you’re talking about a really serious issue, taking away people’s civil liberties,” Jennifer Friedenbach of the Coalition on Homelessness told KPIX-TV. “We want to do something that actually works, that’s not just a fake political move.”

15,"Illegal immigrants can hurt US economy, professor argues, prompting calls for his firing",Dom Calicchio,"A college professor in Georgia is drawing criticism for his online comments about illegal immigrants, including his contention that people in the U.S. illegally can be a drain on the nation’s economy.

“If you are going to reward illegal immigrants, there will be more illegal immigrants,” Fang Zhou, an associate professor of history at Georgia Gwinnett College near Atlanta, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

“If you are going to reward illegal immigrants, there will be more illegal immigrants.” — Fang Zhou, associate professor of history, Georgia Gwinnett College

Zhou says he welcomes the criticism, including from those who say he should lose his job, according to the report.

“I am against political correctness,” Zhou, a legal immigrant from China, told the newspaper. “I speak truth to power in class and my students learn about the financial drain of illegal immigration on the economy and the high crime rates of illegal immigrants.

UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SUED FOR ALLEGEDLY CHILLING SPEECH WITH 'BIAS RESPONSE TEAM'

“My students are ‘woke’ and are overwhelmingly against illegal immigration after taking my class,” he added.

But Zhou told the paper he does not force students to share his opinions.

His critics, however, argue that many of Zhou’s assertions have been debunked and they object to some of the terms he uses in his comments, such as “libtards,” and “ghetto thugs.”

One such critic, according to the report, is Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen, the first Vietnamese-American elected to the state’s House of Representatives.

Nguyen posted some of Zhou’s comments on Twitter this week and asked her followers: “Are these the values supported by Georgia Gwinnett College?”

“I have concerns about him teaching those things in a classroom,” Nguyen, a Democrat, told the Journal-Constitution. She noted that nearly 70 percent of the college’s students are either African-American, Asian or Hispanic, and planned to write to college officials to formally complain about Zhou.

20,Jason Chaffetz: Congress doubles down on incentivizing illegal immigration,Jason Chaffetz,"Responding to rewards that incentivize illegal immigration, migrants have flowed into the United States at record rates. In each of the last three months, more than 100,000 migrants have been detained for illegally crossing our borders. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told senators this week that many are renting babies to cross the border.

Of the 144,000 apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) during the month of May, 11,507 were unaccompanied minors. And these were just the ones that were caught.

Congress is upset about tariffs but where is the outrage about human trafficking? These are more than statistics, they are children, but Congress seems unmoved.

DEMS SLAM DHS PLAN TO HAVE TROOPS BOOST BORDER WALL'S 'AESTHETIC APPEARANCE,' REPORTS SAY

DHS estimates that just since September 2018, 1 percent of the entire populations of Honduras and Guatemala have migrated, many dragging vulnerable women and children with them. Rather than working to solve the problem as President Trump has been trying to do, Congress continues to ignore and incentivize more illegal immigration.

Congressional Democrats' latest solution, found in the House Appropriations draft funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, creates new incentives that only exacerbate the problem. The bill calls for:

“. . .Policy documents that define categories of vulnerable individuals who should not be so returned, including: (A) pregnant women; (B) individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; and (C) mentally or physically disabled individuals.”

So in addition to incentivizing migrants to bring children (not necessarily their own) on the dangerous trek, now Democrats also want to reward migrants to bring with them pregnant women or physically disabled people, not to mention the mentally disabled who are more likely to end up becoming part of our massive homeless population.

And there's that special carve out for anyone who claims to be LGBT. How exactly does the government document those claims? For those willing to lie about whose child they just dragged across the desert, no doubt lying about their sexual orientation or mental health status will be far less trouble.

These are not serious solutions. They make the problem worse. With border apprehensions up 99 percent over the same time last year, more and more vulnerable people are at risk. It’s time to get rid of the rewards and incentives, not offer more.

I respect that many are not fans of using tariffs as trade policy. In this case, tariffs provide the leverage Congress refuses to wield in this critical national security battle. Mexico must be part of the solution, but thus far they too have lacked the political will to deter this human trafficking. There should be a consequence and tariffs certainly get Mexico’s attention.

Every Republican House and Senate member should back the president on this issue. Democrats leave us no choice but to wield tariffs, not as trade policy, but as leverage for national security and humanitarian purposes. Anyone who fails to do so, after failing to make the legislative changes necessary to prevent this tragedy, is complicit in the crimes and exploitation our policies incentivize.

22,Kathy Barnette: I am the product of a rape and my life matters,Kathy Barnette,"It is never an easy decision to be vulnerable. The fear of rejection. The fear of shame. The fear of hurting the ones you love are all real and powerful hurdles to overcome.

Yet I am reminded of a quote from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said: “Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the (judgment) that something else is more important than fear.”

This is my something more. This is my story.

KATHY BARNETTE: HERE'S THE ONE THING I WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW ABOUT THE FOURTH OF JULY

I am the product of a rape. My mother was 12-years old when she delivered me. My father was 21-years old.

I had nothing to do with my genesis. I had nothing to do with the conditions under which I was conceived. I had no control over the circumstances that were swirling around me. I had no opportunity to partake in the cumulative decisions that would be made to sustain the pregnancy. Yet, all the while, I was being fearfully and wonderfully woven together in my young mother’s womb.

My life has value. I am not an inanimate object. I am a person. From me, I’ve given birth to two beautiful, healthy, intelligent, and loving little people who are destined to grow up into productive members of this great society. I am a veteran. I am a staunch lover of this country. I’m a supportive sister, a respectful niece and a devoted wife. Best of all, I get the wonderful opportunity to now care for my mother.

My life has value. I have worth that extended beyond the circumstances of my conception. I have multiple degrees. I’ve traveled the world. I’ve spoken before millions. And, I just landed my first book deal with the No. 1 conservative publisher in the nation.

In many aspects, I’ve lived a charmed life. But, it all started with a decision from my mother.

I am eternally grateful to my mom. She had me.

I am forever grateful to my grandma Hattie, who came alongside both my mother and me to provide a safety net for us. I am grateful to my paternal grandparents, who stepped in and assisted my mother in providing for me.

This story is not just about me, however. The story behind every conception, especially as a result of rape, is not just about the child who survived. This story is about my mother, as well – little Mamie Jo.

My birth certificate lists her as merely a “Negro girl.” That tells us nothing about her. My mother is a survivor. She grew up to become a pillar of strength to me and to everyone who crossed her path.

If my story is able to give a voice, a face and a potential future to an unborn child who had nothing to do with his or her genesis, then sharing my story is worth it.

Life has not been a bed of roses for my mother. She has made her fair share of mistakes along the way. There is a pathology that accompanies such a traumatic event.

Yet, as I stand here today, a full-grown woman with a family of my own, I continue to be immensely impressed with my mother. She believed. And she never gave up. She never stopped smiling. She never stopped striving for something better. She refused to be defeated. She refused to be a victim.

Even now I can feel the weight of my mother’s choices. She chose to survive the rape, to endure harsh treatment, to reject the lingering presence of hopelessness and fear.

My mother refused the shame. She did so not because of her circumstances that must have been unbearable. She did so because of the joy that was set before her. She peered into the future and saw me. I am my mother’s joy. And every one of my mother’s decisions concerning my birth had an impact on my life. An impact that will reverberate for all eternity.

I am not here to judge. Above all else, I want to encourage. If my story is able to encourage one mother who is going through one of the toughest times in her life, then sharing my story is worth it. If my story is able to give a voice, a face and a potential future to an unborn child who had nothing to do with his or her genesis, then sharing my story is worth it.

I’m so grateful for the conversations that are being had all across our nation about the morality behind abortions. Is it right? Is it wrong? Is the woman to be the sole decider of my worth … of her unborn child’s worth? This is a tumultuous terrain any family would have to navigate. There is no easy solution. From my perspective, however, there is a right solution. I’m forever thankful my mother made the right decision.

Yet I am reminded of a quote from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said: “Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the (judgment) that something else is more important than fear.”

This is my something more. This is my story.

KATHY BARNETTE: HERE'S THE ONE THING I WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW ABOUT THE FOURTH OF JULY

I am the product of a rape. My mother was 12-years old when she delivered me. My father was 21-years old.

I had nothing to do with my genesis. I had nothing to do with the conditions under which I was conceived. I had no control over the circumstances that were swirling around me. I had no opportunity to partake in the cumulative decisions that would be made to sustain the pregnancy. Yet, all the while, I was being fearfully and wonderfully woven together in my young mother’s womb.

My life has value. I am not an inanimate object. I am a person. From me, I’ve given birth to two beautiful, healthy, intelligent, and loving little people who are destined to grow up into productive members of this great society. I am a veteran. I am a staunch lover of this country. I’m a supportive sister, a respectful niece and a devoted wife. Best of all, I get the wonderful opportunity to now care for my mother.

My life has value. I have worth that extended beyond the circumstances of my conception. I have multiple degrees. I’ve traveled the world. I’ve spoken before millions. And, I just landed my first book deal with the No. 1 conservative publisher in the nation.

In many aspects, I’ve lived a charmed life. But, it all started with a decision from my mother.

I am eternally grateful to my mom. She had me.

I am forever grateful to my grandma Hattie, who came alongside both my mother and me to provide a safety net for us. I am grateful to my paternal grandparents, who stepped in and assisted my mother in providing for me.

This story is not just about me, however. The story behind every conception, especially as a result of rape, is not just about the child who survived. This story is about my mother, as well – little Mamie Jo.

My birth certificate lists her as merely a “Negro girl.” That tells us nothing about her. My mother is a survivor. She grew up to become a pillar of strength to me and to everyone who crossed her path.

If my story is able to give a voice, a face and a potential future to an unborn child who had nothing to do with his or her genesis, then sharing my story is worth it.

Life has not been a bed of roses for my mother. She has made her fair share of mistakes along the way. There is a pathology that accompanies such a traumatic event.

Yet, as I stand here today, a full-grown woman with a family of my own, I continue to be immensely impressed with my mother. She believed. And she never gave up. She never stopped smiling. She never stopped striving for something better. She refused to be defeated. She refused to be a victim.

Even now I can feel the weight of my mother’s choices. She chose to survive the rape, to endure harsh treatment, to reject the lingering presence of hopelessness and fear.

My mother refused the shame. She did so not because of her circumstances that must have been unbearable. She did so because of the joy that was set before her. She peered into the future and saw me. I am my mother’s joy. And every one of my mother’s decisions concerning my birth had an impact on my life. An impact that will reverberate for all eternity.

I am not here to judge. Above all else, I want to encourage. If my story is able to encourage one mother who is going through one of the toughest times in her life, then sharing my story is worth it. If my story is able to give a voice, a face and a potential future to an unborn child who had nothing to do with his or her genesis, then sharing my story is worth it.

I’m so grateful for the conversations that are being had all across our nation about the morality behind abortions. Is it right? Is it wrong? Is the woman to be the sole decider of my worth … of her unborn child’s worth? This is a tumultuous terrain any family would have to navigate. There is no easy solution. From my perspective, however, there is a right solution. I’m forever thankful my mother made the right decision.

25,World’s first 360-degree infinity pool confuses social media: ‘Where are the stairs?’,Ann Schmidt,"Infinity pools are about to get even more incredible -- or confusing.

The world’s first 360-degree infinity pool could be constructed in London as soon as 2020, according to British pool design company Compass Pools.

The 159,000-gallon (600,000-liter) pool -- set to go by the name of “Infinity London” -- is planned to be at the top of a 55-story skyscraper in the middle of the city, according to a press release from the company. However, the pool’s location has not yet been confirmed.

INSTAGRAM COUPLE DEFENDS ‘STUPID’ PHOTO ON EDGE OF INFINITY POOL

To make the pool perfectly clear, Infinity London will be made from cast acrylic instead of glass and the floor of the pool will be transparent so people inside the building will be able to see swimmers, the release said.

The top floors of the building will also have a five-star international hotel, with use of the infinity pool exclusive to hotel guests, according to the release.

However, despite all the amenities, people on Twitter were confused as to how people would actually get into the pool.

“Would you dare to swim in world's 1st infinity pool with 360-degree views? Take a look at photos. Where are the stairs?” one person asked.

Another person came up with their own creative solutions.

Some people even took this opportunity to joke about “The Sims” video game.

“I see this as proof that we all live in an advanced version of The Sims. There's no way in or out of that pool. Those people are going to die,” someone tweeted. “Come on, you all know you did this too!”

“For everyone who enjoyed killing Sims in 2001,"" another person joked.

INSTAGRAM COUPLE RESPONDS TO ‘STUPID’ INFINITY POOL PHOTO CONTROVERSY

However, the company explained its system in the press release.

“Swimmers will access the pool through a rotating spiral staircase based on the door of a submarine, rising from the pool floor when someone wants to get in or out.,” the release said.

Alex Kemsley, Compass Pool’s swimming pool designer and technical director said in the release that even though designing the entrance to the pool was a challenge, they were inspired by submersibles.

“We faced some quite major technical challenges to this building, the biggest one being how to actually get into the pool,” he said in the release. “Normally a simple ladder would suffice, but we didn’t want stairs on the outside of the building or in the pool as it would spoil the view – and obviously you don’t want 600,000 litres of water draining through the building either.”

“The solution is based on the door of a submarine, coupled with a rotating spiral staircase which rises from the pool floor when someone wants to get in or out – the absolute cutting edge of swimming pool and building design and a little bit James Bond to boot,” he added.","Infinity pools are about to get even more incredible -- or confusing.

26,Detroit police investigating possible serial killer targeting sex workers arrest homeless man as 'person of interest',Paulina Dedaj,"Police in Detroit have arrested a “person of interest” Friday night in the case of a possible serial killer and rapist targeting sex workers in the east side of the city.

DeAngelo Kenneth Martin, 34, was arrested at a bus stop near 7 Mile Rd. and Gratiot at around 7:30 p.m., several hours after Police Chief James Craig release images and a description of what he called a “person of interest” in the case of three dead sex workers found in abandoned buildings since March.

Craig spoke to reporters Friday afternoon and told them that Martin was believed to be a homeless man who frequented the area in which the three victims were found.

DETROIT POLICE SEARCH 1,000 ABANDONED HOMES FOR POSSIBLE SERIAL KILLER VICTIMS AFTER THREE SEX WORKERS FOUND DEAD

Authorities first alerted the public to a possible “serial killer and rapist” in the area on Wednesday after a third woman was discovered dead in an abandoned home on the east side of Detroit.

The victim had not been identified as of Friday pending family notification but she was described as a 55-year-old female whose death matched a similar pattern to two other victims. Her body was found three to four days after her death, Craig said.

The first body was discovered on March 19 on the east side of Detroit in a “vacant dwelling.” The victim, later identified as Nancy Harrison, 52, was found “partially clad.”

POLICE ID THREE BODIES FOUND INSIDE BARRELS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE PARK NEARLY TWO DECADES LATER

Investigators initially believed she died of a drug overdose but on May 20, the medical examiner’s autopsy report revealed that cause of death was “blunt force trauma.”

Several days later on May 24 a second woman, Trevesene Ellis, 53, was found dead not far from the first victim. She too was found “partially clad” in an abandoned home.

City officials believe there could be more victims, as each body was found “decomposed to a different degree” than the last.

29,Kind stranger helps 'Cinderella' teen pump gas before prom,Janine Puhak,"One North Carolina teenager didn’t need Prince Charming when she was surprised with a fairy godmother before prom. A kind stranger helped the young woman pump gas into her car before she drove to the big dance — a gesture all the more appreciated, as the teen had been “ditched” by her date for the night.

A few days before the April prom, Devin Bennett learned that intended date wouldn’t be able to make the event and “kind of ditched” her, she told KGW 8.

Though disappointed, she wasn’t going to miss out on highly anticipated high school bash — or the chance to wear her glittering blue gown.

“I didn’t want to be sad on prom night, so I went with my friends,” the 17-year-old from Winston-Salem told Yahoo Lifestyle.

BOY'S LETTER TO MOM ABOUT MISSING SCHOOL BUS GOES VIRAL

Before heading to the pre-prom party to take photos with her pals, Bennett stopped at a local Sheetz gas station to fill up her tank, with her mom and aunt trailing in a car behind. Hopping out of her vehicle, she was taken aback to hear a stranger call, “No way — Cinderella shouldn’t have to pump her own gas.”

“Here she was with beautiful hair and makeup,” Sherry Allgood, the good Samaritan, recalled to Yahoo. “I didn’t want her getting messed up.’”

Allgood took over at the pump, and the two women chatted about the fun prom plans — a kind deed that meant more to the teenager than the woman likely realized.

“It made my day because of the fact that I was going by myself and just having someone to help gave me a little more hope,” Bennett said, as per KGW 8.

Soon parting ways, it wasn’t until weeks later that Bennett learned her aunt, Gena Sykes Turpin of Carolina Charm Photography, took photos of the sweet encounter — inspiring her to search for the woman again.

“I just wanted to say thank you to this sweet lady. I don’t know who she is, but on the day of my daughter’s prom, this sweet lady was having none of letting Devin pump her own gas in her prom dress,” the teen’s mom, Nikki Sykes Bennett, wrote in a community Facebook page last month, in a post that has since been liked over 900 times. “If you know who she is, please pass on our thanks!”

From there, the Bennetts soon reconnected with Allgood, Yahoo reports. According to KGW 8, the teen shared the cute photos with the woman and told Allgood that her kind gesture truly made her night.

31,"CNN panel knocks Trump's Mexico deal, suggest it's a distraction from weak US job numbers",Joseph Wulfsohn,"A CNN panel had a pretty pessimistic view of the U.S.-Mexico deal President Trump announced Friday in hopes of ending the migration crisis.

Late Friday, Trump tweeted that threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexico were being ""indefinitely suspended"" because Mexico had agreed to help slow the flow of migrants heading toward the U.S. border.

CNN'S DON LEMON LAMENTS TRUMP-ERA 'TOXICITY' AND TROLLS, SAYS HE MAY MOVE ON: REPORTS

But some folks on the liberal news network were not impressed.

Former Republican U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent called the negotiations ""bluster"" and insisted that Trump never would have gone through with his tariff threat because it would have hurt border states like Texas, where he noted that Democrat Joe Biden was leading Trump in a new poll on the 2020 presidential race.

CNN global affairs analyst Susan Glasser also panned the Trump deal.

""We're all sort of props in this fake game of, you know, 'Let's Stick Up The Neighbors',"" she said. ""To me, it's such a predictable play here because we've seen President Trump run it so many times before.

""At the beginning of the week,"" she added, ""how many people in Washington thought this is exactly where we would be on Friday night?""

""I think everybody did,"" CNN anchor Don Lemon responded.

Glasser went on to say Trump ""failed completely"" to control the border and slammed the ""lack of normal policy process"" leading up to the deal, calling the whole thing ""theater.""

CNN contributor and former Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio insisted this was no ""art of the deal.""

""He created this drama on Monday or Tuesday,"" D'Antonio said, ""and I swear they must have locked up the Mexican delegation in the State Department to keep them there for nine or ten hours and then fed them well and they all had a laugh and they let them out and they said, 'Well, the problem is solved.'

""Well, there was no problem the beginning of the week to solve that was extraordinary,"" he added, ""and now we just have this solution that nobody understands and that won't produce what the president actually promised, which was a big, beautiful wall that Mexico would pay for.""

""Is this all about reelection?"" Lemon asked.

""Of course it is,"" D'Antonio answered.

Lemon then invoked the nation's job numbers for May, which fell below expectations, and questioned if Trump's deal had anything to do with the weak stats.

That’s the distance one Toronto tragic traveled this week just to see his beloved Raptors take the floor in Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.

Eric George, a media professional who lives in Melbourne, Australia, packed a bag and hopped on two flights Wednesday to make it to Oakland, California, in time for Friday night’s game.

George, who adopted the Raptors as his team more than a decade ago when his parents traded the sunny beaches of Sydney for the snowy slopes of British Columbia, Canada, told Fox News it was “surreal” to be seeing his team play for the first time on the sport’s biggest stage.

“Following a team from a long distance is a pretty specific experience. So getting to see this all in person, in the finals, is slightly strange and very fun,” he said.

Toronto’s stars must’ve known he was in attendance, as the Raptors dominated the Warriors in the second half to take a 105-92 win.

“It’s surreal to be here: supporting the Raptors has always meant suppressed expectations,” George said.

“But it’s incredible to be here inside the arena. A proper once in a lifetime experience.”

40,"US makes deal with Mexico on tariffs, immigration, Trump announces",Vandana Rambaran,"The U.S. has reached an agreement with Mexico that heads off the start of tariffs on Monday.

The deal, announced by President Trump via tweet on Friday night, is said to include plans to return migrants seeking asylum to Mexico, where they will remain until their claims can be processed.

""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,"" he said. ""Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to....stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!""

HUNDREDS OF AFRICAN MIGRANTS CROSS US-MEXICAN BORDER IN TEXAS OVER PAST WEEK: REPORTS

Trump had taken a tough position toward Mexico earlier in the day, tweeting, ""If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!"" Mexico was able to avoid these tariffs on farm and agricultural products, according to Trump's announcement.

Mexico promises to deploy its National Guard throughout Mexico, particularly at the border, increase actions to dismantle human trafficking operations to smuggle individuals across the border, and take extra steps to coordinate with the American government to share information and ""better protect and secure our common border,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

Even members within Trump's party had, in the days leading up to Friday's announcement, advised against imposing tariffs on Mexico, warning of the calamity it could cause for both nation's economies. Also of concern: the possibility of hindering a trade deal with Mexico and Canada.

Trump was proposing a 5 percent tariff on Mexcian goods, which would increase up to 25 percent every month, potentially harming American consumers and manufacturers who purchased $378 billion worth of Mexican imports in 2018.

Some Democrats responded with ire even in the wake of the new deal. One was 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, who tweeted: ""The damage of Trump's reckless trade policies and tariffs has already been done. What we see is yet another example of him trying to be both the arsonist who created this problem in the first place and the firefighter who wants credit for addressing it.""

Nonetheless, Republican leader Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee congratulated Trump on the agreement, calling it a ""strong win for Texas and America.""","The U.S. has reached an agreement with Mexico that heads off the start of tariffs on Monday.

Hugh F. Culverhouse Jr. said the school was punishing him for urging students to consider other educational options in the state. He pledged last year to donate $26.5 million in all over four years -- in what would have been the largest donation in the school's 187-year history.

""I expected this response from UA,"" Culverhouse said in a statement to Fox News. ""I will not allow my family's name to be associated with an educational system that advocates a state law which discriminates against women, disregards established federal law and violates our Constitution.""

The transfer of the $21.5 million back to the 70-year-old real estate investor and lawyer was processed Friday. The school said the dispute was not related to concerns over the state's abortion law.

""The action taken by the board today was a direct result of Mr. Culverhouse's ongoing attempts to interfere in the operations of the Law School,"" the university's vice chancellor for communication, Kellee Reinhart, said in a statement to Fox News. ""That was the only reason the Board voted to remove his name and return his money.""

Alabama Chancellor Finis St. John recommended returning the money, saying Culverhouse's expectations of how his gift would be used were ""inconsistent with the essential values"" of the university.

ALABAMA SETS ADOPTION RECORD AMID ABORTION DEBATE

Culverhouse said he ""never demanded that $21.5 million be refunded"" and wonders if the board's vote was an attempt to ""silence opinions by their quick response.""

Upon gifting the donation, he told the university the monetary gift was intended to fund scholarships to admit more students.

""Despite the diligent efforts and good faith of our Dean and President, there is no path forward consistent with those values. While we are grateful to all of our donors and supporters, and very grateful to this donor and his family, donors do not dictate our administration of the University,"" St. John said Friday.

Months after his donation, Culverhouse called for a boycott of the school over Alabama's restrictive abortion ban.

ALABAMA ABORTION LAW CHALLENGED IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD LAWSUIT

The law was passed last month and set to take effect in November. It would make terminating a pregnancy a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison for the provider, with no exceptions for rape or incest.

Culverhouse did not attend Alabama, but his parents did. The business school is named after his father, Hugh Culverhouse Sr., a wealthy tax lawyer and former owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL franchise.

After the vote, he said the donations from him and his father over the years were, in part, to rid the state of negative stereotypes.

“We are the land of the backward, we are hicks, we lack the sophistication to see two sides to an argument.”

The Associated Press contributed to this report.","The University of Alabama board of trustees voted Friday to give back $21.5 million from a philanthropist who urged students to boycott the school over the state's controversial abortion law, and then promptly removed his name from the campus' law school named in his honor.
""I will not allow my family's name to be associated with an educational system that advocates a state law which discriminates against women, disregards established federal law and violates our Constitution.""
The school said the dispute was not related to concerns over the state's abortion law.

47,New England Patriots' Super Bowl LIII ring is the largest 'ever made' and loaded with stones,Elizabeth Zwirz,"The New England Patriots were given their Super Bowl LIII rings on Thursday night and the jewelry is said to be both impressive in size and loaded with precious stones.

Jostens was tasked with coming up with the look of the ring, ESPN reported. The company explained its design of the piece on their website, which tells the story of the team’s accomplishments.

The ring, which is made from 10-karat gold, “is the largest Super Bowl ring ever made,” Jostens said. It features various diamonds and sapphires.

“The Patriots Super Bowl LIII Championship Ring features an average 416 of round diamonds and 6 marquise-cut diamonds for a carat weight of 8.25 carats,” Jostens said. “Each ring features 20 round, genuine blue sapphires for 1.60 carats, bringing the total gem carat weight to 9.85 carats.”

The face of the ring shows the team’s logo in a red and blue stone. It's accompanied by a diamond in the star and is outlined with 38 more diamonds, the total of which is a significant number, Jostens said.

“When combined, these 39 diamonds represent two NFL records reached by the Patriots with their Super Bowl LIII win -- the franchise's 37th playoff victory, more than any other team, and their profound accomplishment of becoming the second team in NFL history to win six Super Bowls, also an NFL best,” they explained.

Also featured on the ring are six Lombardi trophies – which is presented to the winner of the Super Bowl. The trophies are “intricately set with 123 diamonds, each accented with a marquise-cut diamond,” according to Jostens.

Placed around the trophies are 108 pave-set diamonds, meant to signify the total amount of Patriots practices during their 2018 season, the company said.

“WORLD CHAMPIONS” is written on the side of the ring top, Jostens said before describing the placement of more stones.

“A patriotic 76 diamonds adorn the edges of the ring,” they said. “Completing the intricate design are 20 round blue sapphires, which are emblematic of the Patriots 20 AFC East division championships.”

The ring’s left side boasts features such as the recipient’s name, an illustration of Gillette Stadium and the player’s diamond-encrusted jersey number, according to the company. The final score of the game and “the rally cry of STILL HERE” are visible on the right side.

Engraved on the inside is the phrase “We are all Patriots,” which is a notable quote from the team’s owner Robert Kraft, Jostens said.

The NFL traditionally covers the cost of roughly 150 rings for the championship team, which are rewarded to players, coaches, executives and others at the winning team’s discretion. Each set of Super Bowl rings is valued at roughly $5 million, though the team’s preferred design factors into the final cost.

48,"Where do 2020 Democrats stand on the Green New Deal, climate change?",Julia Musto,"Since the February release of controversial Democratic Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., Green New Deal, many 2020 presidential candidates have released their own proposals to tackle the issue of climate change.

The original Green New Deal has been supported by many candidates, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas. It has been hailed by the left as a framework for dramatically cutting the United States’ dependence on fossil fuels -- amid a recent report warning of the economic costs climate change would cause in coming years.

WHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES

But conservatives have slammed the Green New Deal itself, which could cost as much as $93 trillion, or approximately $600,000 per household, according to a new study co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as an unworkable and enormously expensive scheme.

GREEN NEW DEAL ARCHITECT SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN LEAD TO '25 HOLOCAUSTS'

Which begs the question -- just where do those Democrats with dreams of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue stand on the issue? Do they support the controversial Green New Deal, and what are their own climate platforms?

Here’s what some have come up with so far…

The 22-page outline released by former Vice President Biden proposes reaching net-zero carbon emissions and achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2050. It calls for an investment of $1.7 trillion of federal funds over the next 10 years, plus private-sector and state and local investments adding up to more than $5 trillion dollars. The money would be paid partially by undoing President Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden’s plan refers to Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, after facing criticism from Democratic presidential rivals about his commitment to environmental protection. Biden has repeatedly insisted his stance is not moderate. In a statement, he pledged to “not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change,” but to “go much further.”

Former President Barack Obama had pledged the U.S. would lower its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

Biden would design “environmental justice” programs to help the poor and minorities who would face disproportionate economic harm from pollution. Biden also promised to provide retraining and new economic opportunities for coal, oil, gas, and other industrial workers displaced by the decline of the fossil fuel industry.

His most aggressive initiative in the plan is the call to compel other countries—particularly China—to reduce emissions. Biden would aim to combine climate change policy with trade policy using the imposition of “carbon tariffs” on goods imported from heavily polluting economies.

Hours after the rollout, many noted the similarities between Biden’s plan and the plans of other candidates. Republicans reacted by accusing Biden of the same offense that hampered his presidential campaign in 1988. Tweeting from a state visit to the UK, the president weighed in: “Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies, not people, to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up, I mean nobody. You can’t win without people!”

The campaign, which had no response when asked by Fox News about the Trump tweet, said earlier on Tuesday that it was a mistake: ""Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren

On Tuesday, Warren unveiled a plan to tackle climate change she dubbed the “Green Manufacturing Deal.”

Her plan would pump $2 trillion into green jobs and technology innovations in the United States. It would also eliminate the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies.

Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. She would also roll back some provisions of the GOP’s 2017 tax law.

The plan is part of a new series of policies Warren will continue to roll out that focus on investing in American jobs and innovation.

The plan is also meant to emphasize Warren's support for reaching the goals of the Green New Deal. Warren released a plan earlier this month on protecting public lands, which would roll back many of the president’s environmental policies, halt offshore drilling, and restore the original boundary lines for two national monuments.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg supports the Green New Deal as well, but has not released his own plan. In May Buttigieg told “Fox News Sunday’s” Chris Wallace, ""What the Green New Deal gets right, is it recognizes that there's also an economic opportunity. Retrofitting buildings means a huge amount of jobs for the building trades in this country.” If the U.S. cannot go carbon-free by 2030, he says he supports going net carbon-free. During a town hall on MSNBC on Monday, Buttigieg told Chris Matthews and an inquisitive eighth grader he would call for a carbon tax, building retrofits, better soil management, and a quadrupling of federal funding for energy and research development.

Last month, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee released a plan hailed by Ocasio-Cortez as the “gold standard.” It would meet, and even exceed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change targets for carbon reduction.

The “Evergreen Economy Plan” begins on day one of his administration. By 2030, it aims to reach 100 percent zero emissions from new vehicles, zero carbon pollution from all new commercial and residential buildings and would require total carbon-neutral power across the country.

By 2035, it proposes completely clean, renewable and zero-emission energy nationwide.

In his 38-page proposal, Inslee seeks to accomplish his plan’s goal through tax incentives for using clean technologies, direct government construction, federal funding of private efforts, regulatory mandates, and use of public land and cooperation with private companies.

Additionally, the plan adds more initiatives like green infrastructure and gradual de-carbonization of existing buildings. Inslee promised to raise the minimum wage and protect collective bargaining power for unions, ensure a ""just transition"" and jobs for workers in the fossil fuel industry, and mandate employers follow guidelines for gender pay parity.

Calling for a $9 trillion investment in green jobs over 10 years, Inslee said his plan would create eight million well-paying jobs for Americans in the transition.

""These folks who have worked in the coal industry are deserving of incredible respect and dignity,"" Inslee told ABC News.

""They are people whose contributions of multiple generations have literally built the economy of the United States, people who are doing really hard work, and are deserving of our respect and what we've done in the state of Washington, which is to make sure that as we go through this transition, that we also make sure we are caring for and embracing these communities to make sure they have a future as well,” he said.

O’Rourke announced his own four-pillar plan to combat climate change just days before Governor Inslee.

The Texan’s plan labels climate change “the greatest threat we face.” He plans to invest $5 trillion over 10 years in infrastructure and innovation and set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

His emission reduction goal is also in line with the Green New Deal. According to the proposal, O’Rourke’s mobilization would be “directly leveraged by a fully paid-for $1.5 trillion investment” and the bill he would introduce to Congress would be funded by ""changes to the tax code to ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies.”

O’Rourke also plans to re-enter the Paris agreement on his first day in office and would ""set a first-ever, net-zero emissions by 2030 carbon budget for federal lands, stopping new fossil fuel leases, changing royalties to reflect climate costs, and accelerating renewables development and forestation.”

Service member's photo shoot a joke for buddies deployed overseas, he says",Brie Stimson,"A U.S. Marine stationed in Florida got a little risqué recently, posing as a mermaid in a professional photo shoot – all to raise the spirits of his buddies deployed overseas, according to reports.

Beau Shepherd told Louisville FOX station WDRB-TV the mermaid choice was personal.

“Well, my job in the Marines is amphibious, as in we move from sea to land, so I wanted to include that,” he said. ""So I mainly wanted something as a joke to my Marine buddies that would make them laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.""

The photo shoot involved Shepherd wearing a luxurious turquoise mermaid tale – and not much else.

Jacqueline Elliot, with Magic Memories Photography in Trinity, Fla., said Shepherd is the father of one of her daughter’s classmates.

Elliot told Tampa's FOX 13 that although she usually does photo shoots for children he approached her about himself. She said they have also discussed making a calendar to raise money for charity.

52,Ali Noorani: America needs immigrants – they are vital to our success and prosperity,Ali Noorani,"President Trump would like us to believe that immigrants are a burden on our country, costing us billions of dollars a year to support and absorb, and harming us with drug smuggling and other crimes. But in fact, the jobs report released by the U.S. Labor Department Friday tells us a different story – and explains why America needs immigrants.

“Our country is FULL!” the president tweeted April 7, saying the “Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States.”

President Trump even threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican products coming to the U.S. starting Monday if that nation did not take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorized immigrants.

US MAKES DEAL WITH MEXICO ON TARIFFS, IMMIGRATION, TRUMP ANNOUNCES

But the president announced via Twitter Friday night that the tariffs were “indefinitely suspended” because the U.S. and Mexico had signed an agreement under which “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to….stem the Tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, illegal immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”

Yet despite the president’s focus on keeping immigrants out, what has been true throughout our nation’s history remains true today: immigrants are the key to America’s economic growth, success and prosperity. And immigrants are vital if we are to maintain continued American leadership in a broad range of businesses and innovation.

The initial takeaway from the May jobs report that came out Friday is that America’s mighty economic engine continues humming along, showing the 104th straight month with an increase in jobs.

With the national unemployment rate now just 3.6 percent, we are looking at the real possibility that in a few months the current economic expansion could become the longest on record, surpassing the stretch from March 1991 to March 2001.

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

OK, so what does this have to do with the need for new immigrants?

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

Decreasing fertility, an aging population, and labor shortages endanger America’s long-term economic vitality. To address the structural challenges that will bedevil American competitiveness, we need a prudent immigration policy for the 21st century.

In the past, we could rely on birth rates to power growth, but according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, the general fertility rate in the U.S. was down 2 percent from 2017 to 2018.

That may not sound like a big drop, but it is. The total fertility rate was the lowest on record and below the rate at which a population replaces itself over time.

To make matters worse, the population isn’t just stagnating, it’s aging. Baby boomers – the single largest population cohort in history – are rapidly becoming booming elders. In just a decade, older Americans are set to outnumber children for the first time in history.

This is not a sustainable trajectory for the U.S. economy.

What has long separated the U.S. from nearly every other economy in the world is immigration. Last year immigration accounted for nearly half of population growth in the U.S.

And while the Trump administration pushes hardline immigration policies and questions the merits of immigration writ large, in many parts of the country economic growth is outpacing growth in the labor force, producing serious labor shortages.

America has 1 million more job openings than we do unemployed workers. We’ve had fewer than one unemployed person per available job for at least a year.

It’s a phenomenon that is not striking all parts of the nation equally.

Our cities and their nearby suburbs are continuing to exert a magnetic force on our population, drawing people away from small towns and rural areas that are serving as canaries in the coal mine for this demographic crisis.

For example, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 30 undocumented immigrants last year, businesses are struggling to fill 300 open positions.

About six hours to the east, researchers at Ball State University in Indiana released a report showing that since 2000, a full quarter of that state’s population growth came from immigrants.

But things could have been worse. From 1990-2016, 17 counties in Indiana saw a loss of population even though they saw an increase in their immigrant population. Population losses would have been an even bigger problem without immigration.

What’s lost in our current immigration debate is an important fact: Immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers. Studies clearly demonstrate that the economy is not a Darwinian zero-sum game.

U.S.-born workers typically take jobs that require higher levels of education and skills and pay higher wages, while immigrants tend to fill jobs that require lower skill levels.

Immigrants are also more likely than native-born Americans to launch a business. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were created by immigrants or their children.

Immigrant families matter as well. First and foremost, they provide comfort and well-being for newcomers. They also provide social networks that enable immigrants to find jobs and child care, integrate into society, and even receive loans to launch a company. We can’t have a functioning immigration system and a thriving society without valuing family.

Between now and 2035, all growth in the U.S. workforce will come from immigrants and their children. That means that without continuing immigration, our economy would be in big trouble.

It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground around immigration reforms that ensure our workforce grows with our economic and social needs.

This requires rebuilding our legal immigration system to provide a stable, reliable workforce – from the skilled farmworker to the skilled engineer.

If we are to act in our national self-interest, that means that no one who graduates from an American university with a degree in science technology, engineering or math should be kicked out of the country and sent to a competitor nation. We need them here.

And no American business trying to hire construction workers should shutter because government policy makes it too hard to hire newcomers.

Sensible immigration reform also needs to recognize the critical importance of immigrants working legally but not permanently. This includes young immigrants brought to the U.S. without authorization who are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, as well as those with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure visas.

And sensible immigration reform needs to create an opportunity for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization to meet certain conditions – including but not limited to passing background checks and learning English – and then start the process of becoming full-fledged, fully contributing Americans.

Above all, immigration reform should send an unambiguous message: The U.S. remains open to those who want to contribute and provide the dynamism that has powered our growth since the country’s founding.

While Friday’s positive jobs figures evince the current strength of our economy, our prospects moving forward will depend on whether we remain a nation of immigrants.

The bottom line is that admitting immigrants to the United States and creating a path to citizenship for them is not simply an act of compassion or charity. In addition to being the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. It will benefit our country and our entire population far into the future, just as immigrants and their descendants have done throughout our history.

56,Ali Noorani: America needs immigrants – they are vital to our success and prosperity,Host Of The Podcast,"President Trump would like us to believe that immigrants are a burden on our country, costing us billions of dollars a year to support and absorb, and harming us with drug smuggling and other crimes. But in fact, the jobs report released by the U.S. Labor Department Friday tells us a different story – and explains why America needs immigrants.

“Our country is FULL!” the president tweeted April 7, saying the “Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States.”

President Trump even threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican products coming to the U.S. starting Monday if that nation did not take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorized immigrants.

US MAKES DEAL WITH MEXICO ON TARIFFS, IMMIGRATION, TRUMP ANNOUNCES

But the president announced via Twitter Friday night that the tariffs were “indefinitely suspended” because the U.S. and Mexico had signed an agreement under which “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to….stem the Tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, illegal immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”

Yet despite the president’s focus on keeping immigrants out, what has been true throughout our nation’s history remains true today: immigrants are the key to America’s economic growth, success and prosperity. And immigrants are vital if we are to maintain continued American leadership in a broad range of businesses and innovation.

The initial takeaway from the May jobs report that came out Friday is that America’s mighty economic engine continues humming along, showing the 104th straight month with an increase in jobs.

With the national unemployment rate now just 3.6 percent, we are looking at the real possibility that in a few months the current economic expansion could become the longest on record, surpassing the stretch from March 1991 to March 2001.

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

OK, so what does this have to do with the need for new immigrants?

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

Decreasing fertility, an aging population, and labor shortages endanger America’s long-term economic vitality. To address the structural challenges that will bedevil American competitiveness, we need a prudent immigration policy for the 21st century.

In the past, we could rely on birth rates to power growth, but according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, the general fertility rate in the U.S. was down 2 percent from 2017 to 2018.

That may not sound like a big drop, but it is. The total fertility rate was the lowest on record and below the rate at which a population replaces itself over time.

To make matters worse, the population isn’t just stagnating, it’s aging. Baby boomers – the single largest population cohort in history – are rapidly becoming booming elders. In just a decade, older Americans are set to outnumber children for the first time in history.

This is not a sustainable trajectory for the U.S. economy.

What has long separated the U.S. from nearly every other economy in the world is immigration. Last year immigration accounted for nearly half of population growth in the U.S.

And while the Trump administration pushes hardline immigration policies and questions the merits of immigration writ large, in many parts of the country economic growth is outpacing growth in the labor force, producing serious labor shortages.

America has 1 million more job openings than we do unemployed workers. We’ve had fewer than one unemployed person per available job for at least a year.

It’s a phenomenon that is not striking all parts of the nation equally.

Our cities and their nearby suburbs are continuing to exert a magnetic force on our population, drawing people away from small towns and rural areas that are serving as canaries in the coal mine for this demographic crisis.

For example, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 30 undocumented immigrants last year, businesses are struggling to fill 300 open positions.

About six hours to the east, researchers at Ball State University in Indiana released a report showing that since 2000, a full quarter of that state’s population growth came from immigrants.

But things could have been worse. From 1990-2016, 17 counties in Indiana saw a loss of population even though they saw an increase in their immigrant population. Population losses would have been an even bigger problem without immigration.

What’s lost in our current immigration debate is an important fact: Immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers. Studies clearly demonstrate that the economy is not a Darwinian zero-sum game.

U.S.-born workers typically take jobs that require higher levels of education and skills and pay higher wages, while immigrants tend to fill jobs that require lower skill levels.

Immigrants are also more likely than native-born Americans to launch a business. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were created by immigrants or their children.

Immigrant families matter as well. First and foremost, they provide comfort and well-being for newcomers. They also provide social networks that enable immigrants to find jobs and child care, integrate into society, and even receive loans to launch a company. We can’t have a functioning immigration system and a thriving society without valuing family.

Between now and 2035, all growth in the U.S. workforce will come from immigrants and their children. That means that without continuing immigration, our economy would be in big trouble.

It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground around immigration reforms that ensure our workforce grows with our economic and social needs.

This requires rebuilding our legal immigration system to provide a stable, reliable workforce – from the skilled farmworker to the skilled engineer.

If we are to act in our national self-interest, that means that no one who graduates from an American university with a degree in science technology, engineering or math should be kicked out of the country and sent to a competitor nation. We need them here.

And no American business trying to hire construction workers should shutter because government policy makes it too hard to hire newcomers.

Sensible immigration reform also needs to recognize the critical importance of immigrants working legally but not permanently. This includes young immigrants brought to the U.S. without authorization who are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, as well as those with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure visas.

And sensible immigration reform needs to create an opportunity for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization to meet certain conditions – including but not limited to passing background checks and learning English – and then start the process of becoming full-fledged, fully contributing Americans.

Above all, immigration reform should send an unambiguous message: The U.S. remains open to those who want to contribute and provide the dynamism that has powered our growth since the country’s founding.

59,Joshua Rogers: I went on a search for my fifth grade teacher -- here's what happened when I found her,Joshua Rogers,"As I clicked “publish” on my blog post, I had a faint hope that I would find my fifth-grade English teacher, Ms. Saucier. The blog post was titled “If Jesus were a fifth-grade teacher.”

I had lost touch with Ms. Saucier several years before and despite online searches, I had come up with nothing. The blog post was both a tribute and a last-ditch effort to find her.

The blog post didn’t make it to Ms. Saucier — not at first. It did make it to a reader named Amy. Her mom knew someone who knew Ms. Saucier, her name was Sue, and she offered three possible contact numbers. None of them worked. I left my number with Sue and prayed that God would help Ms. Saucier and I reconnect.

I NEVER THOUGHT MY DAUGHTER WOULD LEARN THIS WORD IN KINDERGARTEN

Three weeks later, I got a text from an unfamiliar number. It read, “Hello Josh Rogers. My friend Sue gave me your number, and I am so thrilled to be able to say hello to you. Have thought of you often…please catch me up on your life. Look forward to hearing from you. Love you, Ms. Saucier.”

With my heart racing, I immediately called the number and waited. A woman picked up and answered with that warm, familiar voice I remembered from fifth grade.

“Hi, Ms. Saucier,” I said. “I just wanted to talk so I could say, 'thank you.'""

At different points in your life, Jesus has sent along a “Ms. Saucier” — a person who helped you feel safe and loved. Maybe, like my Ms. Saucier, it was a person whose love brought healing.

She couldn't believe how hard I had worked to find her, but I told her I felt like I had to. I wanted her to know how much she had meant to me.

“My family was going through a lot back then and I was acting out a lot. I think the other teachers saw me as a problem child but you made me feel like you loved me.”

“I really did love you,” she said.

“Remember that time I wrote a short story and handed it in to you even though you didn’t even assign it?” I asked.

She laughed.

“I’ll never forget what you wrote on it after you read it: ‘Great job! I’ll vote for you when you run for President!’ You have no idea how much that meant to me.”

“I said it because I believed it, Joshua. I always knew you were going to do something very special with your life.”

The conversation went on for quite a while, just as naturally as our conversations did when I was a kid. And before we said a teary goodbye, she said, “I hope you know I still fully expect you to be President one day — and I’d better get an invitation to the inauguration.”

Classic Mrs. Saucier.

The other day I was thinking about Ms. Saucier and it brought to mind a story about Jesus and ten lepers – social outcasts of their day. Jesus healed all ten simultaneously, but only one returned to thank Him.

“Didn’t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?” (Luke 17:17).

I can hear the sadness in Jesus’ question, like a disappointed parent whose child shows no gratitude on Christmas morning. But then there’s a warmth you can feel when Jesus turns and says to the one who returned, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well” (Luke 17:19).

The man’s grateful return to Jesus resulted in a double blessing; and today, you can experience a blessing of your own, if you’re willing.

At different points in your life, Jesus has sent along a “Ms. Saucier” — a person who helped you feel safe and loved. Maybe, like my Ms. Saucier, it was a person whose love brought healing.

Don’t be one of the nine lepers who disappears and never returns to offer thanks. Be the person who remembers the gift you’ve received and find the one who gave it. Tell that person what he or she meant to you — tell God what that person meant to you. You may end up being the one who receives the biggest blessing.

60,Strassel: Democrat Klobuchar deflates a Trump ‘scandal’,Kimberley A. Strassel,"Democrats have grown expert in these Trump days at creating fake scandals. So it’s refreshing to read a previously undisclosed email in which Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a presidential aspirant, destroys a leading narrative even as she highlights her own party’s excesses.

The “scandal” here involves Twin Metals Minnesota, which holds two mineral leases on government land outside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the northeastern part of the state. The Interior Department had renewed the leases continuously for decades. But when Twin Metals got serious about a mine, the Obama administration jumped into bed with green activists who ardently opposed it.

AMY KLOBUCHAR'S FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: 4 TAKEAWAYS TO KNOW

In 2014, Interior delayed the renewals, calling for more “study.” In early 2016, the department’s solicitor issued a howler of a legal opinion, granting the government new authority to deny Twin Metals automatic lease renewals. It was an Obama extralegal classic: The opinion ignored precedent, existing rights and regular procedure. In a midnight kiss to green activists, the department officially blocked the leases on Dec. 15, 2016.

This highly irregular decision was destined to get a fresh look from the Trump team. The new president’s appointees at the Interior and Agricultural departments all came to office determined to restore the law and regulatory certainty. In December 2017, the new Interior principal deputy solicitor found the prior opinion fatally flawed and moved to renew Twin Metals’ leases. The company moved on to an arduous environmental review, and it could still be blocked by the feds or the state. Beyond some furious greens, that should have been the end of the matter.

Instead, we are in an age where every move by the executive branch is judged not on the policy merits but on a “corruption” scale. Early in 2017, stories started popping up about how Twin Metals was controlled by the family of a Chilean billionaire. And that billionaire also owns a house in Washington, which he rents out to . . . Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Scandal! Payoff! Sleaze!

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

It didn’t matter to critics that the Chilean doesn’t know the Trumps, that Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner have never met their landlord, or that they pay a market rent of $15,000 a month. Nor did it matter that the decision was an obvious one for the Trump team to reconsider on the merits, or that the new opinion was rock-solid and corrected a legal embarrassment.

Democrats and activists have instead spun this as straight-up cronyism. Green groups routinely slam the decision as a favor to “Ivanka’s landlord.” Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton decried the “shameful reversal” as proof that “big corporate money and special-interest influence now rule again.” House Democrats sent letters to Interior and Agriculture Secretaries David Bernhardt and Sonny Perdue harping on the landlord question. The goal is to gin up a scandal of the type activists used to run out other Trump appointees.

Enter Ms. Klobuchar. Or, at least enter an email she wrote to then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Dec. 16, 2016, the day after the leases were blocked. Government sources provided me this missive, in which a furious Ms. Klobuchar punctures the scandal narrative and skewers her own party for putting politics ahead of the law.

Ms. Klobuchar bluntly states that the decision not to renew the lease “just floored me. Trump will reverse this. When you guys leave and are out talking about a job message for rural America, I will be left with the mess and dealing with the actual jobs.

61,Strassel: Democrat Klobuchar deflates a Trump ‘scandal’,Kimberley Strassel Is A Fox News Contributor,"Democrats have grown expert in these Trump days at creating fake scandals. So it’s refreshing to read a previously undisclosed email in which Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a presidential aspirant, destroys a leading narrative even as she highlights her own party’s excesses.

The “scandal” here involves Twin Metals Minnesota, which holds two mineral leases on government land outside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the northeastern part of the state. The Interior Department had renewed the leases continuously for decades. But when Twin Metals got serious about a mine, the Obama administration jumped into bed with green activists who ardently opposed it.

AMY KLOBUCHAR'S FOX NEWS TOWN HALL: 4 TAKEAWAYS TO KNOW

In 2014, Interior delayed the renewals, calling for more “study.” In early 2016, the department’s solicitor issued a howler of a legal opinion, granting the government new authority to deny Twin Metals automatic lease renewals. It was an Obama extralegal classic: The opinion ignored precedent, existing rights and regular procedure. In a midnight kiss to green activists, the department officially blocked the leases on Dec. 15, 2016.

This highly irregular decision was destined to get a fresh look from the Trump team. The new president’s appointees at the Interior and Agricultural departments all came to office determined to restore the law and regulatory certainty. In December 2017, the new Interior principal deputy solicitor found the prior opinion fatally flawed and moved to renew Twin Metals’ leases. The company moved on to an arduous environmental review, and it could still be blocked by the feds or the state. Beyond some furious greens, that should have been the end of the matter.

Instead, we are in an age where every move by the executive branch is judged not on the policy merits but on a “corruption” scale. Early in 2017, stories started popping up about how Twin Metals was controlled by the family of a Chilean billionaire. And that billionaire also owns a house in Washington, which he rents out to . . . Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Scandal! Payoff! Sleaze!

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

It didn’t matter to critics that the Chilean doesn’t know the Trumps, that Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner have never met their landlord, or that they pay a market rent of $15,000 a month. Nor did it matter that the decision was an obvious one for the Trump team to reconsider on the merits, or that the new opinion was rock-solid and corrected a legal embarrassment.

Democrats and activists have instead spun this as straight-up cronyism. Green groups routinely slam the decision as a favor to “Ivanka’s landlord.” Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton decried the “shameful reversal” as proof that “big corporate money and special-interest influence now rule again.” House Democrats sent letters to Interior and Agriculture Secretaries David Bernhardt and Sonny Perdue harping on the landlord question. The goal is to gin up a scandal of the type activists used to run out other Trump appointees.

Enter Ms. Klobuchar. Or, at least enter an email she wrote to then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Dec. 16, 2016, the day after the leases were blocked. Government sources provided me this missive, in which a furious Ms. Klobuchar punctures the scandal narrative and skewers her own party for putting politics ahead of the law.

Ms. Klobuchar bluntly states that the decision not to renew the lease “just floored me. Trump will reverse this.

63,These are the 25 hottest collector cars of 2019,Gary Gastelu,"The summer collector car auction season is in full swing and it’s not all about multi-million classics.

Outfits like Mecum, Barrett-Jackson and others do most of their volume in the mid-priced arena, but those buyers are still looking for a return on their investment.

So what are the hottest cars for 2019? Well, according to the Hagerty Vehicle Rating, they’re trucks.

Topping the list, which tracks interest in vehicles based on sales prices and insurance policies quoted and initiated by Hagerty, is the original 1966-1977 Ford Bronco, which has been having a moment thanks in part to anticipation about its long-awaited successor that’s set to go on sale in 2020. Prices for top examples of the off-roader have doubled in just the past three years.

BIZARRE FORD F-150 SPOTTED. COULD IT BE THE NEW BRONCO?

The second generation 1978-1979 Bronco is tied for second place with its top rival, the 1973-1991 Chevrolet C/K Blazer. Hagerty valuation editor Andrew Newton says this is likely because the first gen Fords are starting to get too expensive.

The 1963-1983 Jeep Wagoneer – another SUV about to get a reboot – and 1967-1972 Chevrolet C/K pickup are in a five-way tie for fourth with the first sports cars on the list, the 1977-1981 Toyota Celica, 1990-1996 Nissan 300ZX, 1993-2002 Mazda RX7 and 1999-2002 BMW M Coupe, which is affectionately known as the ""Clown Shoe"" and has been selling for an average price of $45,300. That’s up more than $10,000 so far in 2019.

The top 10 actually turns out to be a dozen, with a three-way tie for the last spot that includes the 1973-1987 Chevrolet C/K pickup, 1981-1986 Jeep CJ-Scrambler pickup -- boosted by the arrival of the new Jeep Gladiator – and the original 1990-1988 Mazda MX-5 Miata.

65,Hunter whose giraffe photo went viral says she's 'absolutely' still hunting: 'I am proud of that giraffe',Ann Schmidt,"A woman whose hunting photo of a giraffe went viral last year said that despite her shock at the backlash to the photos, she continues to hunt and remains proud of her hobby.

Tess Thompson Talley, from Kentucky, spoke with CBS on Friday about the giraffe she hunted in South Africa in 2017, that ended up going viral last year when pictures of her hunt were posted online.

Trophy hunting is a legal practice in a number of African countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

""It's a hobby, it's something that I love to do,"" Talley told the network.

AMERICAN HUNTER’S IMAGES OF HER BLACK GIRAFFE ‘TROPHY KILL’ SPARK OUTRAGE

""I am proud to hunt,"" she added. ""And I am proud of that giraffe.""

Talley told the outlet she ate the meat of the giraffe, and made decorative pillows and a gun case using its skin.

She explained that the specific hunting trip that caused so much uproar was actually part of conservation efforts to manage wildlife in a specific area. Though she isn’t a conservationist herself, she uses her hobby to “do my part,” she said.

""Everybody thinks that the easiest part is pulling the trigger. And it's not,"" she added. ""That's the hardest part. But you gain so much respect, and so much appreciation for that animal because you know what that animal is going through. They are put here for us. We harvest them, we eat them.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED PLAN FOR EXPANDED HUNTING, FISHING ACCESS ACROSS 1.4 MILLION PROTECTED ACRES

She reiterated if her hunting wasn’t contributing to conservation efforts, she wouldn’t participate.

""Just knock down animals just to be knocking them down, and it not helping anything?"" she told CBS. ""No.""

Talley also clarified that posing with her kill is part of a hunting tradition.

""The pictures are a tradition that hunters have done long before social media,"" she said. ""When social media came around, that's when there was an issue.""

Despite the backlash she’s received from those photos -- including from people trying to get her fired -- she told CBS she’s “absolutely” still hunting.

On Friday, Fox News reached out to Talley for comment, but did not hear back immediately.

BIG-GAME HUNTERS DEFEND KILLS, SAY THEY WON’T BACK DOWN AFTER RECEIVING BACKLASH FOR POSTING PHOTOS

Talley’s photos went viral after the Twitter account Africa Digest tweeted pictures of Talley and the giraffe.

“White American savage who is partly a Neanderthal comes to Africa and shoot down a very rare black giraffe courtesy of South Africa stupidity,” read the June 2018 tweet. “Her name is Tess Thompson Talley. Please share.”

The images spurred deep emotions among those opposed to the controversial practice, including prominent animal activist and Hollywood actor Ricky Gervais, who tweeted about giraffes being endangered at the time the pictures went viral.

At the time, Talley explained her hunt to Fox News.

“The giraffe I hunted was the South African sub-species of giraffe,” she said in an email last July. “The numbers of this sub-species is actually increasing due, in part, to hunters and conservation efforts paid for in large part by big game hunting. The breed is not rare in any way other than it was very old. Giraffes get darker with age.”

She pointed out that the giraffe she killed was 18, too old to breed, and had killed three younger bulls who were able to breed, causing the herd’s population to decrease. Now, with the older giraffe dead, the younger bulls are able to continue to breed and can increase the population.

“This is called conservation through game management,” Talley said at the time, insisting hers was not a “canned” hunt.

Fox News’ Hollie McKay contributed to this report.","Trophy hunting is a legal practice in a number of African countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

66,"‘All That’ star Lori Beth Denberg talks Nickelodeon reboot, reprising Loud Librarian role: ‘It’s weird’",Stephanie Nolasco,"For Nickelodeon, the ‘90s are officially back.

The TV network recently unveiled its new cast of seven teens and tweens for the reboot of their popular sketch comedy series “All That.” The revival’s premiere, which is making a debut on June 15, will feature original cast members Lori Beth Denberg, Josh Server and Kel Mitchell, who also serves as executive producer alongside Kenan Thompson.

'LEAVE IT TO BEAVER' STAR TELLS ALL

Denberg, 43, who reprised her Loud Librarian character, told Fox News it felt as if no time has passed. The original series aired from 1994 until 2005.

“It’s weird,” she explained. “When I talk to some of the original cast members like Kel and Josh that have been back, it’s weird that it’s not weird. I walked onto the Loud Librarian set, which I haven’t been on in [over] 20 years... it’s the same. I’ve got the script, I’m doing the Loud Librarian and it’s like no time has passed. But it’s been 25 years.”

While “All That” now features a whole new set of characters and child actors, Denberg insisted fans of the original show will quickly embrace what Nickelodeon has to offer.

“I think the biggest thing is just that everyone’s continuing with the same show that was on 25 years ago, meaning it’s smart, it’s irreverent, it’s wacky, it’s edgy,” said Denberg. “It’ll be messy, I’m sure. All the great things that you love about the original ‘All That,’ and I think just folding in the boys as producers and us as original cast members — it's going to bring in the parents that used to watch us, and the kids. Everyone’s going to love each other. But, it’s really meshing the old and the new together into kind of a seamless blob of comedy.”

CHRIS FARLEY'S BROTHER TELLS ALL

Chinguun Sergelen, a newcomer who's been acting since he was 9, said he’s proud to offer entertainment that will bring families together.

“When you get older, you just remember those moments you had with family and cousins or really good friends when you had the best time of your life,” said the 13-year-old. “Because I… was hanging out with my mom and my aunts and cousins. Man, those were the days.”

“I am so glad that I can be a part of a show that is so hilarious,” chimed Kate Godfrey, 15. “So families all across the world can watch it, laugh together, be together and enjoy it together.”

While it’s still unknown whether more original cast members will appear in the reboot, Denberg teased that it’s a big possibility. The series is known for launching the careers of several stars, including Nick Cannon and Amanda Bynes.

FARRAH FAWCETT'S PALS TELL ALL

“I’m sure that plenty of the old crew will show up here and there,” said Denberg. “That’s part of the fun of doing this — folding in original cast members and original characters with all the great new stuff that these guys are bringing to the table. I don’t have any secret information to give you, and if I did, I couldn’t tell you because it would be secret information, by definition. But, I’m sure people will show up when you least expect them, bringing back some of your old favorites and some new stuff.”

Denberg previously told Entertainment Weekly she was surprised at being asked to do some of her classic sketches, assuming she was merely on set to pass on the torch to the new cast. However, Denberg insisted she was thrilled to revisit her childhood.

“It has been really fun, and a little surreal to come back and for me, do characters that I haven’t done in 25 years,” she said. “But the best part in the whole world has been getting to hang out with these [new] guys and watch them work. The cast is so fun, smart, funny… [and] energetic. There’s just such a good vibe on the set and that’s my favorite part.”

Denberg insisted that she hopes original viewers will enjoy a blast from the past, all while introducing new audiences to a lighter, more family-friendly form of comedy.

ELVIS PRESLEY'S PAL TELLS ALL

“I hope they have a good time,” said Denberg. “I hope they are able to discover what people liked so much about the original… You know… the ‘90s kids who are all grownups now, come up to me and are like, ‘[This show] made my childhood. It was my favorite thing.’ It’s really nice to look back on something I’m proud of and have it been so well-received and hold a place in people’s hearts.”

67,Jerry Seinfeld and his wife Jessica reveal the secret behind their lasting marriage,Stephanie Nolasco,"Love is still in the air for Jerry Seinfeld and his wife of 20 years, Jessica Seinfeld.

According to the star, the secret behind their lasting marriage is surprisingly simple — comedy.

JERRY SEINFELD EXPLAINS WHY HE TURNED DOWN $5 MILLION OFFER

“From the day I met her, that was really our connection,” the 65-year-old told Closer Weekly on Friday. “We always have fun and we laugh and she’s got a great sense of humor. She’s very quick and sarcastic and all the qualities that I like. She’s very sharp. She catches all the wrongness.”

“All the badness,” chimed the 47-year-old. “… We just make each cry and laugh all day.”

The couple tied the knot in 1999 and are proud parents to three children: Sascha, 18, Julian Kal, 16, and Shepherd Kellen, 13.

And apparently, time does fly for the pair.

“You know what, we got married in ’99,” reflected the “Seinfeld” alum to the outlet. “I thought, I think you thought, ‘Boy, the math will be so easy’ and it’s not, it’s impossible.”

ELIZABETH HURLEY, 53, SIZZLES IN HOT PINK BIKINI

“So this is 20?” the comedian asked his wife, who reminded him that their 20th anniversary is at the end of the year.

“So this December will be 20 years? Wow. That’s amazing,” he gushed to the outlet.

Jessica said her spouse has long been supportive of her work with Good + Foundation, a nonprofit she founded that aims to combat poverty. According to its site, the nonprofit pairs “tangible goods with innovative services for low-income fathers, mothers and caregivers, creating an upward trajectory for the whole family.”

“I think it’s very natural,” Jessica explained about the couple’s devotion to their passion projects. “I don’t think it’s something we think about. I think, I love what he does and I support his work and he has really responded to the work that we do and has been there from the beginning and has heard me and watched me and listened to me. And he naturally just wants to be there and be supportive because he loves the work and he loves me.”

WHY 'SEINFELD' IS OFFENDING MILLENNIALS

In late 2018, Seinfeld told Us Weekly that the duo enjoys trying new eateries to keep the marriage fresh. It’s also the perfect compromise for a homebody (him) and a social butterfly (her) that has worked over the years.

“That’s a great adventure for us,” he said. “That’s what I like to do. Jess is more geographically adventurous than I am. She wants to see the world. But I’m more interested in the new restaurant.""

The couple have also been dedicated parents determined to give their children as normal of an upbringing as possible.

“They have their little nastiness, and you know, they close themselves in their rooms and stuff,” said Seinfeld at the time. “But you can just barge in and go, ‘OK. Out of the room, off the screen.’ You can push them around still.”

Seinfeld also previously told Oprah.com how the pair tackles marital fights.

JERRY SEINFELD KEEPS HOPE ALIVE OF POSSIBLE REBOOT

“The best piece of advice I received before I got married was, ‘Be careful what you say when you’re in a fight because it could stick in someone’s head,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve ever said anything I really regretted. I’m very sympathetic to women. I’ve really studied wifeology, and I know you’ve got to figure out the feelings. Deal with the feelings.”

“If you’re a man, you have to figure out what she needs to hear,” he continued. “So ask her: ‘What do you need to hear me say?’ And then just say it. That’s a very good way out of an argument. But then you have to act — you have to say it as you mean it. Even our kids have this thing where, if you say, ‘I’m sorry,’ they go, ‘No, say a nice sorry.’ If it’s not a nice sorry, it doesn’t count.”

Seinfeld also revealed monogamy comes naturally to him and he wouldn’t have it any other way.

“My personal viewpoint is this: The problem with humans is our heads are just way too big,"" he said. ""And one of the greatest appeals of monogamy is the simplification of the mental process. I don't have any friends who aren't faithful to their wives, but if I did, my main question would be, ‘Who's got time to figure all that out?’ It's just too much work.

“The emotions that have to be disposed of, the values, the ethics... All I see is this gigantic amount of work for a fleeting pleasure. People should get married because they have finally seen the folly of being single: ‘Oh, this is all just kind of a bad magic trick. I just keep bending over to reach for this wallet on a string. How much longer am I gonna do that?’""","Love is still in the air for Jerry Seinfeld and his wife of 20 years, Jessica Seinfeld.
According to the star, the secret behind their lasting marriage is surprisingly simple — comedy.
JERRY SEINFELD EXPLAINS WHY HE TURNED DOWN $5 MILLION OFFER“From the day I met her, that was really our connection,” the 65-year-old told Closer Weekly on Friday.
“You know what, we got married in ’99,” reflected the “Seinfeld” alum to the outlet.
“They have their little nastiness, and you know, they close themselves in their rooms and stuff,” said Seinfeld at the time.","['jerry', 'married', 'seinfeld', 'say', 'sorry', 'work', 'told', 'marriage', 'reveal', 'think', 'really', 'thats', 'shes', 'jessica', 'lasting', 'secret', 'wife']",,http://www.foxnews.com
68,"'Bigfoot' hair samples turned out to be from deer, newly released FBI documents reveal",Brie Stimson,"The FBI released documents from its vault Wednesday on the bureau's short-lived investigation into Bigfoot in 1977.

The 22 documents show that the bureau’s Scientific and Technical Services Division examined 15 hairs sent by Peter Byrne, who was head of the now-defunct Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in Oregon.

BIGFOOT SIGHTINGS: 8 BEST STATES TO SEE THE LEGENDARY SASQUATCH

“Will you kindly, to set the record straight, once and for all, inform us if the FBI has examined hair which might be that of a Bigfoot,” an August 1976 letter from Byrne says. “Please understand that our research here is serious. That this is a serious question that needs answering.”

Jay Cochran, then assistant director of the division, wrote back that while the bureau primarily examines criminal investigations, “on a case-by-case basis, in the interest of research and scientific inquiry, we make exceptions to this general policy.”

The hairs were examined in 1977 and determined to be of deer origin.

Byrne, now 93, told CNBC Wednesday he hasn't given up hope on the existence of Bigfoot.

69,Bride cancels her wedding just to spite mother-in-law,Michael Hollan,"A bride-to-be canceled her entire wedding to spite her future mother-in-law, and the Internet is cheering her on.

Reddit user GirlofBeans took to the site’s Just No Mother-In-Law forums to tell her story. She and her fiancé were planning their wedding when her future mother-in-law demanded that they invite 65 extra people and that it was non-negotiable.

It turns out, GirlofBeans doesn’t negotiate. She takes action.

Her post starts off, “I (26F) have been with my now husband (26M) for roughly 4 years. Things have always been rocky with his mother. He is from a very wealthy family, and I haven’t really lived up to her expectations. I’m from a very comfortable middle-class family, and she refers to us as the ‘bumkins.’ She is overbearing and manipulative, and my husband admits the same.”

“We got engaged a while ago, and have been planning our wedding for about a year,” she continues. “The thing is, a legit wedding ceremony has never really been us, it always felt like we were planning out of obligation.”

“TWO MONTHS before our wedding date, his mother sends me a detailed spreadsheet with about 80 people on it, telling me that none of these invitees were optional, and I had better invite all of them. Our wedding was initially only about 50 people, and only about 15 of the people on the spreadsheet were invited. She mentioned how they all had bought flights and booked hotels, even though they had never received invites. This kind of flew me into a blind rage. I called everyone and canceled. We got married in a national park with our two best friends.”

BRIDE WON'T LET GRIEVING MAID OF HONOR OFF THE HOOK FOR BACHELORETTE PARTY

When another user asked how the mother-in-law responded, GirlofBeans replied, “I kind of wish the theatrics were there when we told her. She is very much an ‘appearance’ person, so she would never make a scene. She kind of blanched and was visibly horrified when she realized that SHE would have to call everyone she invited and cancel on them because they weren’t a part of our formal guest list. Honestly, it felt really good to finally see her squirm for once.”

Normally, canceling a wedding after guests have booked flights and made hotel reservations would be considered rude, but in this case, it seems like people were willing to make an exception.

One user called it a “perfect reaction,” saying, “It's not a major blowup over a minor difference of opinion. It's putting your foot down when it needs to be down.”

Another user replied, “She should have at least offered to pay (full (or part, worst case)) her guests´ dinner and stuff if she were going to do that. No one other than the wedding couple is gonna decide who will and won´t be there and she sure isn´t deciding what the wedding will be like.”

Other users praised her husband for going along with the cancellation, with one posting, “I'm so glad your significant other went with it. I guess that's why you married him in the first place.”

Mostly, people just seemed proud of GirlofBeans for standing up for herself. One user posted, “You are my hero. Screw that lady and her manipulative bullshit.

73,Former Disney star Jordan Pruitt says she hopes to see her alleged sexual abuser ‘in an orange jumpsuit’,Julius Young,"Former Disney star Jordan Pruitt is doubling down on her claims that she was sexually abused as a teenager working in the often unforgiving entertainment business.

The singer and songwriter spoke to Fox News about her harrowing experience which she says went on for two years, as well as the fallout she has seen since sharing her story publicly about the man she alleges sexually abused her and continues to work with underage girls.

Pruitt first made her shocking revelation in a lengthy Facebook post published in December 2018 in which she wrote that an important male figure in her life began “grooming” her in 2006 while he was engaged to be married to another woman and she was just 15.

“This all started when I was about 13 and the advances really kind of started around 14, but nothing was ever sexual until I was about 15,” Pruitt told Fox News in an extended interview. “I can remember him saying, you know; 'Let me teach you how to kiss. You don't want to get out into the world and be a bad kisser.' I vividly remember that.""

And that's how it all started.

FORMER DISNEY STAR JORDAN PRUITT SAYS SHE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AS A TEEN: 'THIS PERSON HAD BRAINWASHED ME'

Pruitt, now 28, said she was too young to understand what the man wanted from her and that it wasn’t until she was much older when she began to realize the magnitude of what she had endured as a working teen.

“I mean, at 14 I was like, 'Oh yeah, you're right.' You know, this is a prominent man and he's basically taking interest in my talent. I just thought, for me, because I was from a town with one stoplight — I really thought that 'OK, I guess this is normal.' I was raised from church and raised to believe that everybody has the best of intentions. So I really didn't realize it like that until I was a good 20 or 21 that through everything that had happened, I had basically been sexually molested for two years of my life.”

Pruitt said the ""level of trauma"" she faced ""is honestly indescribable."" She said for five years after the abused stopped, she ""had forgotten that it had happened"" which her therapist tells her is a ""form of your brain basically protecting you from feeling.""

AMID #METOO, STATES DEBATE TEACHING CONSENT TO KIDS

When Pruitt turned 21, she said she began to realize the full extent of the abuse and that's when she developed an anxiety disorder coupled with denial and anger.

She said she began to wonder things like: ""OK, what can I do about this? Why did this happen? Do I tell my parents? Are they going to lose it? I just don't know. I had so many thoughts in my mind — am I capable of love?""

Pruitt said she wants to share her story and that's why she first wrote about it on social media late last year. She said she refrained from divulging too much about the man due to his position in the industry and out of fear of retaliation about a potential legal battle should she reveal his identity.

""My [Facebook post] originally was supposed to be much longer because I love to write. But I didn't want to divulge too much, obviously, because of the caliber of person who he is today,” Pruitt said. “And also I didn't want to,” she pauses before continuing – “I basically had meetings with a bunch of different attorneys and they said that he could sue me for everything and take everything that I had, which is a scary thought.”

ALY RAISMAN OPENS UP ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE, SAYS IT’S HARD TO HEAR OTHER SURVIVORS’ STORIES

Pruitt alleges a few women have since privately come forward to her claiming to have had their own traumatic experiences with the man she alleges abused her. The former child star also said she was “disappointed” that others haven’t been able to identify the alleged perpetrator.

Pruitt maintained: “I will say because I really wanted to just nail him. But, it's going to happen one of these days. It's not honor and I wouldn't be wanting to answer to all of his sins in front of the creator of the universe.”

When asked if she feels her alleged abuser will ever apologize for his actions or see justice for his crimes, Pruitt paused before describing the man as “the biggest narcissistic person I have ever met in my entire life who can manipulate just about anyone into doing anything.”

LARRY NASSAR SENTENCED TO 40 TO 175 YEARS IN GYMNASTICS MOLESTATION CASE

“So no, I don't think he would ever be sorry and he probably at this point doesn't think he's done anything wrong, honestly. He's going to take himself down one of these days, sooner or later. It's not necessarily my job, but I obviously felt like legally I had to tell my truth and the story.”

Pruitt said she has since been in a lifelong personal battle to take back control of her life from her alleged abuser and she’s doing so by writing a book that will aim to assist other survivors.

Pruitt, who has since married a former tour mate and works as a songwriter in Nashville, said the book, “AA: Abuse Anonymous,” came to her in a “thought from God.”

“I was lying in bed a couple months ago, and I can sleep through anything so I'm definitely not a light sleeper. So it is unusual for me to wake up in the middle of the night at 2 o'clock, basically just pacing my bedroom,” said Pruitt.

“I woke up my husband and I'm like, 'I can’t go back to bed; I think I'm supposed to write a book.' And he says, 'Well, you're a great writer, so write a book.' I felt like the thought was given to me from God, saying that I need to write a book because I got the title and the title of every single chapter. I started writing it that night and I've been writing it ever since.”

“And I hope through my book they go from surviving to finally, after a long process of healing to thriving.

We're here to serve other people and if I'm able to do that, hell yeah — I've done my job.”

When asked if she would be addressing her alleged abuser in her forthcoming book, Pruitt confirmed she would be delving into the details surrounding her abuse “a thousand percent.”

77,"Dogs mirror stress levels of their owners, study suggests",Christopher Carbone,"Are you feeling stressed about the state of the world? Turns out that anxiety could be rubbing off on your dog.

Researchers have been able to confirm what dog owners have sensed for years: Household pets can actually mirror their owners' feelings of stress.

The study analyzed the stress hormone cortisol, which circulates in the blood and leaves its mark in strands of hair.

HERE'S WHY THE SUPERNATURALLY CREEPY DRAGONFISH HAS INVISIBLE TEETH

Researchers in Sweden examined 25 border collies, 33 Shetland sheepdogs and the female owners to discover that higher cortisol in human hair was matched by more of that hormone in the dog hair.

According to The Guardian, about half of each breed enrolled was involved in regular training and competitions to test skills such as obedience and agility, and the rest of the dogs were regular companion pets, in order to see whether canine lifestyle was a factor in stress levels.

""To our knowledge, this is the first study to show interspecies synchronization of long-term stress,"" the researchers write in the study's conclusion.

The team of researchers believe there is more to the synchronization than simply sharing the same environment, The Guardian reports.

The scientists even looked at whether the dogs had a garden to play in and whether they lived with other dogs, but they found no impact on dog cortisol levels from those factors.

78,A man spent $300 on a painting at a thrift sale. It could be worth millions,Chris Ciaccia,"Philip Stapleton was perusing a thrift sale in the U.K. when he came across a painting he liked so much, he spent nearly $300 on it, even though he assumed it was fake. But after doing some research and talking to experts, the 52-year-old antique collector may have made the purchase of a lifetime – an original work by Pablo Picasso.

Stapleton said that he spent 230 British pounds ($293), even though he believed to be fake because he ""loved the picture,"" SWNS reports. Acting on a whim, Stapleton took it Brighton and Hove Auction House, where he received the potentially good news.

“It is so exciting - one of our regular buyers came into the auction house with what he felt was a picture that had Picasso on it - he didn’t know that it was anything special,"" Brighton and Hove Auctions general manager Rosie May said in comments obtained by SWNS.

MYSTERIOUS 'NUDE MONA LISA' MAY HAVE BEEN DRAWN BY DA VINCI

Initially, May was put off by the signature of the famed painter, who likely gave the portrait to a friend, Roland Penrose. After studying the painting intently and taking it out of the frame, she found a message with a ""very clear"" signature from Picasso, but one from earlier in his life.

“The signature is clearly Picasso but with a message - you could try to work out what it says, it could be in Spanish, it could be in English, it could be in French we’re not sure, but very definitely there’s the name Roland and a date, but the date’s quite indistinct - we’d love to know what the message says,"" she continued.

As such, she now believes it's likely that the artwork is genuine.

“But because the signature on the front is one of his early signatures, it didn’t match with the painting of the Seated Bather. It sat by the desk for a while and just intrigued me so I looked at it more, picked it up, turned it over and on the back you can see very faintly Roland Penrose Estate.""

May continued: “Further down is ‘collection P Picasso and just very faintly with a spyglass you can see it says Javier, and Javier Vilato was one of Picasso’s nephews that he was really close who also had a collection of Picassos, who also exhibited them.” She added that Picasso's friendship with Penrose started around the 1950s, ""so we believe he probably gifted it to him and wrote the message on the back.""

The chances are slim that it is a fake, as May believes there is ""no way"" that someone would copy Picasso's painting in that fashion, including the messages to Penrose, an unfinished foot and set in a slightly different canvas than the original one. “So for us, everything adds up.""

The heralded Spanish painter, who is known for paintings such as ""Guernica,"" ""The Weeping Woman"" and ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,"" died in 1973 at the age of 91.

DA VINCI WAS AMBIDEXTROUS, NEW HANDWRITING ANALYSIS SHOWS

Stapleton said that he is “like a rabbit in headlights” when he heard the painting could be authentic. It's likely that the painting will be sold for at least $950,000 (750,000 British pounds), but paintings from Picasso in the past have sold for more than $130 million.

“That’s the exciting thing about what we do - you never know what you’re going to get through,"" Andrew Potter, the owner of Brighton and Hove Auction House, said in the interview. “So if this is the genuine article, it’s never been seen before and we’re talking life-changing sums of money for the owner. It’s an exciting time for us because we do this business to help people.”

The painting is set to go up for auction later this month.

84,"Lori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli could face court battle with USC over college admissions scandal, says report",Stephanie Nolasco,"Things are only getting worse for Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli.

According to a letter from the couple’s attorney filed in federal court, the “Fuller House” actress and the fashion designer could face legal disputes with the University of Southern California (USC) over the couple’s alleged role in the college admissions scam.

LORI LOUGHLIN'S CO-STAR TELLS ALL

The Los Angeles Times reported on Friday the letter doesn’t indicate whether USC is considering suing Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli, 56, or if the university expects to be sued. However, the letter does show the couple’s attorney dismissed anticipation of civil disputes as “completely speculative.”

USC, as well as BJ Trach, an attorney for the couple, did not respond to a request for comment.

The outlet shared that Georgetown, another university involved in the scandal, was recently sued by the son of a Los Angeles parent who pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy. The son, Adam Semprevivo, is suing to prevent Georgetown from nullifying his credits.

Trach told prosecutors in the letter dated May 6 that USC is worried the arrangement “may cause public embarrassment” and “adverse publicity.” The outlet shared that the letter offers “a glimpse of behind-the-scenes legal jockeying” in a case that has sent attorneys scrambling in hopes of protecting the reputations of both parents, as well as the school they allegedly defrauded.

'FAMILY GUY' MOCKS COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL IN EMMY

Loughlin and Giannulli pleaded not guilty in April to charges that they paid $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters into USC. The couple is among 50 prominent parents, athletic coaches and others charged in a sweeping college admissions bribery scam that has embroiled elite schools across the country, including Stanford, Georgetown and Yale.

Loughlin and Giannulli were charged with paying bribes to have their daughters designated as crew recruits to USC, even though neither of them is a rower. Authorities say Loughlin and Giannulli helped create fake athletic profiles for the teens by submitting photos to admissions consultant Rick Singer of their teens posing on rowing machines.

After their older daughter was admitted to USC, authorities say Giannulli sent Singer an email with the subject line, “Trojan happiness,” thanking him for his “efforts and end result!”

Their daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli – a social media star who has a popular YouTube channel – was dropped from deals with cosmetics retailer Sephora and hair products company TRESemme after her parents’ arrest.

CANDACE CAMERON BURE UNSURE HOW LORI LOUGHLIN'S ABSENCE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN 'FULLER HOUSE'

If convicted on all charges, Loughlin and Giannulli each face up to 40 years behind bars.

The Los Angeles Times revealed that out of 33 parents named in an FBI affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston in March of this year, more than half are accused of conspiring to bribe their way into USC.

Federal investigators are reportedly now exploring whether Pat Haden, the former USC athletic director, was involved in the scandal. In response, Haden issued a statement on Wednesday through his son-in-law Donnie Dixon Haden.

“Like many people, I was introduced to Mr. Singer several years ago by a friend,” read the statement. “I was unaware of his illegal activities and had no ongoing relationship with him whatsoever.”

Donnie added that his father-in-law had not “been contacted by or spoken to federal authorities.”

""He was so close to the cash record,"" Jennings added. ""And it just shows how fragile a 'Jeopardy!' streak is.""

86,Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie Olivia Brower says she no longer feels pressure to be a certain size,Stephanie Nolasco,"Olivia Brower, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit’s newest pinup, has never been prouder of her curves.

The 24-year-old joins models Camille Kostek, Haley Kalil, Tara Lynn, Jasmine Sanders, Winne Harlow and Kesley Merritt as the magazine’s official rookies for 2019. The California-born beauty headed to The Bahamas where she unveiled her sizzling shape while rocking skimpy swimsuits.

SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL HALIMA ADEN TALKS WEARING A HIJAB, BURKINI

Brower, along with 31 other Sports Illustrated stars, recently headed to Miami for “SI Swimsuit on Location,” a two-day ticketed exhibition which gave fans the opportunity to explore one-of-a-kind installations and photo experiences, among others. The magazine’s stars all celebrated at Mynt and Myn-Tu, the newly opened Japanese-French concept restaurant by Romain Zago next to the lounge. It was there where they candidly shared their experiences posing in the sizzling issue.

But Brower, who originally kicked off her modeling career when she was just 16, insisted there’s more to the honor of posing for Sports Illustrated than just wearing bikinis. She recently spoke to Fox News about what it was really like shooting for this year’s issue, how she came to love her body, the message she has for critics and how she stays in camera-ready shape all year long.

Fox News: What was it like shooting for this year’s issue?

Olivia Brower: For me, it was just a really exciting and wonderful experience. I got to go to The Bahamas, which is absolutely stunning. The water is the clearest you’ve ever seen – just pure aquamarine. There’s white sand – it was all just wonderful. I’m still on a high from it.

Fox News: What was your reaction when you saw the photos for the first time?

Brower: I flew into New York the day they released the magazine. I immediately went to two different convenient stores just trying to find an issue. I finally found one and I remember the store clerk being so confused because I just started screaming *laughs*. All I kept saying was “Oh my God!” This is in print and it’s there forever. It was such a surreal moment. And then, of course, I immediately called my mom. She did not answer *laughs*. But my family has been so wonderful and supportive.

SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL CAMILLE KOSTEK FELT INSECURE OVER HER CURVES

Fox News: How important has it been to be part of an issue celebrating diversity?

Brower: It’s very important to me because I feel body diversity and including every body type is so important. I think in this industry, there are a lot of times when people criticize you if your body is not looking a certain way. But I think every body is beautiful. To be part of a magazine that celebrates that and embraces that is just so wonderful.

Fox News: Some are going to say this magazine just has women wearing skimpy swimsuits. What’s your response?

Brower: I don’t think they’ve really opened up the magazine and seen the women that are on there or the message they’re trying to send. Although these are women wearing bathing suits, it’s so much more than that. It’s so much more to other young girls and women who look at this magazine and see this diversity of bodies. We have someone like Hunter [McGrady], who I absolutely adore and am really obsessed with. She’s beautiful and proudly embraces her curves. That means so much to many different people who can identify with her.

Fox News: How do you cope with the pressures of having to look a certain way or be a certain size in order to make it in the modeling industry?

Brower: You know, for me, I don’t really feel those pressures anymore. I think now I’ve grown enough where I can look in the mirror and am able to say, “I am healthy and beautiful for me.” I learned that comparing myself is not going to get me anywhere. And it’s not a healthy state of mind. I really hope that other women reading and looking at the magazine can see that. Just being yourself and being healthy is what makes you beautiful. Everybody has their own unique look and personality. And to embrace that is just such a wonderful thing. That’s where I am right now. I work out every day, I eat healthily, but I don’t work out in the mindset where I’m thinking “I have to lose 10 pounds right now.” No — I want to be healthy and just feel great.

Fox News: With your confidence, how do you deal with not so great days?

Brower: Not so great days come and go. I’ve learned that the opinions of other people don’t really mess me up as much. But when I do have those days, I just don’t think about it too much. I try not to give it that power of affecting me so much. Before it used to cripple me, I used to be so sad from it. Now I learned that I’m happy with me. I feel beautiful and healthy. I don’t need that other person’s opinion.

Fox News: When did you realize that you were willing to proudly accept your body?

Brower: I remember one day saying to myself, “Why am I feeling so low?” I looked in the mirror and I’m as healthy as I’ve ever been. I have a wonderful circle of people around me… I just felt ridiculous for thinking that way. Our bodies are so much more than just one photo.

Fox News: What’s your secret to feeling confident in a swimsuit?

Brower: I get a spray tan *laughs*. But leading up to a shoot like Sports Illustrated, I go to the gym and work out with a personal trainer. My goal is not to lose weight, but rather build that little extra sense of confidence. When I work out, I would also do hot yoga. After class, I just feel so refreshed and it really just helped clear my mind. That’s what I do to get ready — mentally prepare myself…. I also go to a really good spa for a nice scrub and a chance to sit in the sauna just to get that really glowy skin. That’s when I feel beautiful and prepared for a shoot like this one.

Fox News: What do you hope to accomplish next?

Brower: I feel like now things are only getting started for me… I guess you’ll just have to stay tuned!","Brower: You know, for me, I don’t really feel those pressures anymore.

87,Dolly Parton reveals the reason she won't ride roller coasters at her own amusement park,Anna Hopkins,"Dolly Parton is gearing up for a new nautical addition to her famed Dollywood amusement park - but revealed during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" that she likely won't get on board.

The legendary country music singer told host Ainsley Earhardt on Friday morning that Dollywood, her theme park located in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, is hosting a grand opening for the Pirate Voyage - an acrobatic music show aboard a giant boat.

But she's known to not take part in the fun she orchestrates for the park's guests.

""I have a tendency to have motion sickness,"" Parton said. ""I never was good even at riding the school bus so I don't like to ride the rides, but I'm excited about it,"" she continued.

She also admitted she's a bit fearful she may come a bit undone if she goes on her roller coasters.

Since she won't be strapping into the Tennessee Tornado ride, she's particularly excited about the park's new addition, the Pirate's Voyage.

Pirate's Voyage is a water show aboard a giant pirate ship, and viewers can have wait service for food and drinks as they watch. It will feature some talented displays and animals as well as a new, original song from Dolly which is performed by mermaids.

88,"GM president reconfirms electric pickup, says company's EVs will sell for 'average' prices",Gary Gastelu,"General Motors president Mark Ruess says the automaker’s upcoming battery-powered cars will be sold at ""very average transaction prices” as the company works to bring down the cost of the technology.

Reuss was speaking at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation Conference, and said the company’s electric vehicles will reach parity with its internal combustion cars “a lot sooner than people think,” Wards Autos reported.

GM plans to introduce 20 new fully electric vehicles by 2023, but the only one that the company currently builds, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, is a subcompact crossover that starts at $37,495.

The main hurdle to reducing costs is the battery, which ranges from $150 to $225 per kilowatt-hour across the industry, although Tesla said last year that it expected to reach $100 by the end of 2018. The Bolt EV uses a 60 kilowatt-hour pack.

CADILLAC REVEALS TESLA-FIGHTING ELECTRIC SUV

Reuss suggested that the cost reductions on EV tech and the increasing expense of developing internal combustion engines that can meet more rigorous emissions standards will equalize the powertrains soon.

“All these things and more will lead to greater consumer acceptance of EVs, plus they are going to be great cars,” Reuss said.

He also reconfirmed GM’s intent to introduce an electric pickup that will compete with the battery-powered Ford F-150 that is also in the works and Tesla’s promised truck, which Elon Musk said this week would start under $50,000.

No timeframe was given, but Reuss said that the electric car platform in development will be able to accommodate front-, rear- and all-wheel-drive. GM has previously demonstrated an electric military truck based on the Chevy Colorado pickup that used a hydrogen fuel cell instead of a large battery pack and has released renderings of a similar vehicle built on a Silverado chassis.

90,"Tori Spelling shares message of gratitude on 'Beverly Hills, 90210' revival set: 'I get a do over'",Tyler Mccarthy,"Tori Spelling took a moment to express her gratitude while on the set for the upcoming “Beverly Hills, 90210” revival.

Spelling played Donna Martin on the famed 1990s teen drama. In February, the 45-year-old actress revealed that they were getting the “OG crew back together” to play “heightened versions” of themselves after several years off the air. Since then, Spelling, Jason Priestley, Jennie Garth, Shannen Doherty, Brian Austin Green, Ian Ziering and Gabrielle Carteris have all been confirmed to reprise their respective roles.

To show her gratitude, Spelling posted a photo of herself on Instagram as she sits on the ground and stares at the bevy of camera operators setting up around her.

“Just taking a moment in between camera set ups to look around and appreciate how amazing it is that we are coming home to @foxtv with @bh90210 this August,” she wrote in the image’s caption. “I was just 16 years old when the original 90210 started filming and too young to really understand and appreciate the impact our show would have on our generation and generations to come. And, the lifetime bond I would go on to have with all of these actors that became a family to me.”

She concluded: “Well, now I get a do over. At 46 years old this time I’m taking the time to appreciate every moment as it happens. #workfamily #bh90210 #grateful.”

The star previously opened up to People about how excited she is to get the band back together for a revival.

91,"US elections in 2020 need massive overhaul to protect them, security experts argue",Christopher Carbone,"A sweeping overhaul of America's electoral infrastructure is needed in order to prevent foreign interference as the 2020 elections loom, a group of security researchers has concluded.

Former Facebook chief security officer Nick Stamos – who witnessed the sinister social media campaign orchestrated by Russian agents against America – and his colleagues at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center published a 108-page report that recommends a wide range of actions to prevent a repeat of what took place in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including better coordination between government agencies and and social media organizations.

The report, which is called ""Securing Our Cyber Future: Innovative Approaches to Digital Threats,"" can be read in full here. It details a range of recommendations, including:

Increasing the security of U.S. electoral infrastructure by requiring that all vote-counting systems nationwide provide a voter-verified paper audit trail and requiring risk-limited auditing for all elections.

Regulate online political advertising by foreign governments and nationals by explicitly prohibiting them from targeting the American electorate and passing the Honest Ads Act, which would require far more transparency in digital political advertising.

Confront efforts at foreign media manipulation by mandating additional disclosure measures during pre-election periods.

Combating state-sponsored disinformation campaigns from state-aligned actors by creating norms for the media's handling of stolen information, expanding transparency for paid and unpaid political content, establish norms among candidates to not use stolen data or manipulated content and increase overall transparency on social media platforms.

Establish international norms and agreements to prevent election interference by appointing a senior U.S. government representative for it, developing guidelines about platform cooperation among democracies and strengthening international rules for election safety.

Deter foreign governments from election interference by enacting country-specific responses that impose real costs, promoting collective engagement with international partners and conducting a continuous strategic disruption campaign against adversaries that seek to interfere with American elections.

Some of the Stanford report's proposals are already in the process of being enacted by tech companies or have been proposed by lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

Another issue the report calls out is the lack of access to data related to disinformation campaigns.

""At the moment, access to the content used by disinformation actors is generally restricted to analysts who archived the content before it was removed or governments with lawful request capabilities,"" the report states. ""Congress needs to establish a legal framework within which the metadata of disinformation actors can be shared in real-time between social media platforms, and removed disinformation content can be shared with academic researchers under reasonable privacy protections.""","A sweeping overhaul of America's electoral infrastructure is needed in order to prevent foreign interference as the 2020 elections loom, a group of security researchers has concluded.

92,Tuskegee Airman recounts experience in World War II and the struggles faced by first African-American pilots,Anna Hopkins,"A day after the 75th anniversary of D-Day, 94-year-old Tuskegee Airman Lt. Col. Harry Stewart appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the significance of being one of the first African-American army pilots in World War II.

Lt. Col. Stewart told host Steve Doocy on Friday morning the tale of his first mission with the U.S. Army - a ""huge armada"" of 500 B-24 and B-17 bombers traveling from Italy to northern Europe. African-American pilots were allowed to fight for the first time in World War II under the condition that they trained in a segregated unit, dubbed the Tuskegee Airmen.

""It was really rare because just before then, African-Americans were not accepted for pilot training into the Army Air Corps,"" said Lt. Col. Stewart, who dreamed of being a pilot since he was 18.

These memories are particularly vivid for him now because of the anniversary of D-Day, he said. Stewart added that when he returned safely from the war, the recognition of the service of African-American pilots was not widely appreciated.

D-DAY VETERAN, 97, PARACHUTES INTO NORMANDY 75 YEARS LATER

""It was the same old, same it was before we went into World War II,"" he said. ""Recognition was long-coming, and it didn't start coming until maybe the 1970s. And it is still coming along now.""

When he came back from the war, Stewart attempted to become an airline pilot but was not permitted because he was African-American.

93,Annual 'Day of Service' to offer free dental care for veterans,Alexandria Hein,"Thousands of veterans will be offered free dental care on Saturday in Delta Dental’s sixth annual Day of Service event. More than 450 Aspen Dental-affiliated offices will open their doors to veterans across the nation as part of the Healthy Mouth Movement, which has donated more than $15 million in dentistry since its installment in 2014.

“Breaking down barriers to care is at the very core of what we do,” Dr. Anita Imadomwanyi, director of clinical support and charitable giving, said. “The Healthy Mouth Movement and annual Day of Service are continuously among the most impactful initiatives that we champion at Aspen Dental, as they fill the underserved gap in the industry that continues to delay veteran access to necessary dental care.”

TRUMPET USED ON D-DAY RETURNS TO NORMANDY FOR 75TH ANNIVERSARY

Veterans can set up appointments through the 844-277-3646 Aspen Dental phone service to find participating offices in their area. Last year, more than 4,300 veterans took part in the event at over 400 Aspen Dental offices. Dr. Jere Gillan, an airman-turned-dentist, said the day offers him the opportunity to connect with fellow veterans who have had life experiences similar to his own.

“It warms my heart every time I get to meet somebody that’s kind of been through the same thing I have, or we have similar experiences,” Gillan, who practices in Orlando, Fla., told Fox News last year. “I was very fortunate when I left the service to finish college and go on to become a dentist — but I know a very small percentage have had my experience, it’s mostly the opposite.”

Aspen Dental has over 750 affiliated offices in 39 states. Gillan said that the biggest investment for the Day of Service comes from “volunteers, doctors and teams that are there.”

94,D-Day combat patches reproduced by California company honoring US soldiers,William La Jeunesse,"To honor the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy, a California company is reproducing combat patches from D-Day and making them available to relatives of those who fought in that epic battle.

""It is our way of giving back to the men and women who fight for our country,"" says Ira Newman of Action Embroidery of Ontario, Calif.

The U.S. Army is unique among military branches in that all soldiers are required to wear a shoulder patch identifying their units. To those who serve, the patch is more than cloth and thread. It represents a brotherhood, lost or forgotten friends and a link to those who came before.

""He got shot twice in Germany and got wounded coming down,"" said Barry Moss, a Marine-turned military librarian. His father parachuted into Normandy while serving with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day.

""They had guys they served with and the next thing you know they were not there anymore,"" said Moss, recalling one of the few stories his father shared about the war. Like many families, his father's uniform and other memorabilia are in the attic.

U.S. forces invading Normandy were composed mainly of the following Army units: The First Army under Gen. Omar Bradley, the Fifth and Seventh Corps, the First, 4th and 29th Infantry Divisions, the 2nd Ranger Battalion and two airborne divisions, the 101st and 82nd.

Shoulder sleeve insignia, or SSI, are made to precise, government specs.

For example, the First Army patch contains 9,082 stitches. The 1st Infantry, 4,200. Thread on the 4th Infantry patch is sewn with needles exactly two inches apart.

Each is specific, detailed and wrought with meaning. The 29th Infantry's blue-gray design represents soldiers brought together from both sides of the Civil War. The 82nd Airborne's ""AA"" means All-American. It is meant to depict soldiers from every state.

Prior to 1960, each military branch designed its own insignia. Afterward, the Pentagon's Institute of Heraldry standardized the task and awarded contracts. Today, all U.S. military patches are designed in Virginia and made domestically.

97,D-Day combat patches reproduced by California company honoring US soldiers,In March,"To honor the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy, a California company is reproducing combat patches from D-Day and making them available to relatives of those who fought in that epic battle.

""It is our way of giving back to the men and women who fight for our country,"" says Ira Newman of Action Embroidery of Ontario, Calif.

The U.S. Army is unique among military branches in that all soldiers are required to wear a shoulder patch identifying their units. To those who serve, the patch is more than cloth and thread. It represents a brotherhood, lost or forgotten friends and a link to those who came before.

""He got shot twice in Germany and got wounded coming down,"" said Barry Moss, a Marine-turned military librarian. His father parachuted into Normandy while serving with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day.

""They had guys they served with and the next thing you know they were not there anymore,"" said Moss, recalling one of the few stories his father shared about the war. Like many families, his father's uniform and other memorabilia are in the attic.

U.S. forces invading Normandy were composed mainly of the following Army units: The First Army under Gen. Omar Bradley, the Fifth and Seventh Corps, the First, 4th and 29th Infantry Divisions, the 2nd Ranger Battalion and two airborne divisions, the 101st and 82nd.

Shoulder sleeve insignia, or SSI, are made to precise, government specs.

99,D-Day veteran John McHugh recalls Normandy invasion: It was hell on earth,Joseph Wulfsohn,"In an appearance on ""Shepard Smith Reporting,"" World War II Army Cpl. John McHugh on Thursday recalled his harrowing experience as one of thousands of troops storming the beaches of Normandy, describing what he witnessed as ""hell on earth.""

Marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the 95-year-old first-generation Irish-American told how he had to crawl to safety, armed with nothing but a pistol after the machine gun-holding soldier he'd been partnered with died.

""You can't really describe D-Day. You’re so, you’re petrified. You’re absolutely petrified,” McHugh said. “A guy falling over there, a guy falling over there. It’s hell. It’s just hell on earth. I can’t describe it any better. I don’t think anyone can really describe it. ... Needless to say, I had a bad day.”

McHugh told Fox News anchor Shepard Smith that he ""just kept crawling"" up the beach, targeted by armed enemies he could not see.

“And as you crawled along the beach, what were you seeing and hearing?” asked Smith.

“A lot of dead bodies,” McHugh answered. ""A lot of dead bodies ... but you just keep going up. You gotta keep moving. But there were a lot of dead bodies.""

101,Joe Biden caved to ‘exceedingly radical’ Dems on Hyde Amendment: Matt Schlapp,Brie Stimson,"Joe Biden's reversal this week on the Hyde Amendment regarding abortion funding was a surrender to the “exceedingly radical” wing of the Democratic Party, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp argued Friday on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

Biden said Thursday he could “no longer support"" the amendment, which he had backed as recently as Wednesday, saying it makes a woman's right to an abortion ""dependent on someone's ZIP code.”

“The saddest thing of all,” Schlapp told ""Hannity"" guest host Dan Bongino, ""is to watch him stumble through that statement. Clearly, he doesn’t know what to say or what to do.”

BIDEN ADVISER SYMONE SANDERS LASHES OUT AT MEDIA OVER HYDE AMENDMENT COVERAGE

Schlapp added that abortion “is not health care” and said the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationally, doesn’t mean taxpayers should have to pay for abortion services.

Biden, a Roman Catholic, had long supported the Hyde Amendment and has said he personally opposes abortion. So his reversal this week smacked of political expediency, Schlapp argued.

“This is an open-borders, Green New Deal, socialist Democratic Party that believes in post-birth abortion, late-term abortion,” Schlapp said. “They are exceedingly radical and Joe Biden is trying to go along to get that brass ring.”

Another ""Hannity"" guest, Trump 2020 campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, agreed with Schlapp.

“Joe Biden is Puppet Boy,” McEnany said. “There is someone pulling his strings. It’s pathetic. He has no convictions, no principles, no message.”

She said actress Alyssa Milano -- who tried to prevent passage of Georgia's pro-life law -- and low-level Biden staffers appeared to have steered the former vice president away from “whatever principles he had left.”

“This is quite a modest thing to be for,” Schlapp added. “They have become radicalized. This is not your grandfather’s Democratic Party.”

104,Austan Goolsbee: Pelosi 'stepped over the line' with reported remarks about imprisoning Trump,Charles Creitz,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reported remarks about wanting to see President Trump imprisoned were ""over the line,"" according to a former Obama administration economic adviser.

Former Obama White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee made the comments Friday in an appearance on ""Hannity.""

Rep. Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly made her remarks while defending her stance against impeaching the president in an evening meeting earlier this week with House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and other top Democrats, according to Politico.

NANCY PELOSI TOLD DEMS SHE WANTS TO SEE TRUMP 'IN PRISON': REPORT

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” she said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting.

Host Dan Bongino asked Goolsbee if he took issue with Pelosi reportedly making those comments.

""I have somewhat of a problem with that, and I'm glad that wasn't a public statement,"" Goolsbee said. ""I wasn't there. I can't verify she said that. If she did say that, I think that's over the line.""

However, Goolsbee added he believed Trump also committed a similar mistake multiple times during his presidency.

""It's a line that the president of the United States, to be fair, is quite familiar with stepping over, too. Calling for people to be investigated for treason, pronouncing them guilty before there is any investigation,"" he said.

""But, I certainly don't think that it's appropriate to either say you want the president in jail or to say that you think the president should be impeached when there has been no investigation. We haven't had any fact-finding. I think that is stepping over the line.""

105,Jason Chaffetz: Nadler 'running a clown show with buckets of chicken and convicted felons',Charles Creitz,"House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler has been ""running a clown show"" in his proceedings surrounding the Russia investigation, according to Jason Chaffetz.

Chaffetz reacted Friday on ""The Story"" to news Rep. Nadler's, D-N.Y., committee will convene a hearing with former Nixon White House counsel John Dean on Monday.

Nadler said in a statement he learned much from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, adding Congress must continue where the former FBI director left off.

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO HOLD MUELLER REPORT HEARING WITH WATERGATE FIGURE JOHN DEAN

""We have learned so much even from the redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report,"" Nadler said earlier this week. ""Russia attacked our elections to help President Trump win, Trump and his campaign welcomed this help and the President then tried to obstruct the investigation into the attack. Mueller confirmed these revelations and has now left Congress to pick up where he left off.""

Dean, a onetime member of former President Richard Nixon's staff, later testified against the Republican before the Senate Watergate Committee. Dean later served four months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.

Chaffetz, a Fox News contributor and former member of the House Judiciary Committee, said there is not much to be gained from Dean's scheduled testimony.

""This is a made-for-C-SPAN event,"" the former Utah congressman claimed. ""The House seems to be bringing convicted felons before it to somehow give testimony that is going to be compelling. [Dean] can shed no light on the immediate situation, no light on what happened during this event.""

""What Jerry Nadler is doing is running a clown show, with buckets of chicken, convicted felons and people who know nothing about the case at hand.""

Chaffetz' appeared to reference House Judiciary Committee member Steve Cohen bringing a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken to a hearing for which Attorney General William Barr defied a subpoena and did not show up.

Rep. Cohen, D-Tenn., dubbed the attorney general ""Chicken Barr"" for skipping the proceeding.

106,Ben Shapiro: Trump's Normandy media coverage 'preset' to deny president 'full victory',Charles Creitz,"President Trump was rightfully praised for his D-Day speech, but the press coverage was still ""preset"" to disallow him ""full victory,"" according to Ben Shapiro.

Shapiro, editor of the Daily Wire, claimed the mainstream media concentrated on ""ancillary issues"" instead of what was truly happening at the commemoration in Normandy, in an appearance Friday on ""The Story.""

""I think he gave one of the great speeches of his presidency, and yet most of the media coverage surrounded ancillary issues that had pretty much nothing to do with what was happening on the ground,"" Shapiro said.

HELL FREEZES OVER AS JIM ACOSTA, JOE SCARBOROUGH PRAISE TRUMP'S D-DAY SPEECH

The conservative commentator, however, noted two journalists perceived to be critics of Trump, CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, praised his speech at the veterans' cemetery on Thursday.

“This is perhaps the most on-message moment of Donald Trump’s presidency today,"" Acosta said.

Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, called Trump's acknowledgment of the D-Day troops' sacrifices, ""a beautiful moment.""

Shapiro said, outside those reactions, the media gave too much emphasis to some issues they covered.

""I saw a lot of coverage on Twitter of how he signed the joint document with the other allies from World War II, how he signed it at the top of the page,"" he said. ""Ooh, the end of the world.""

107,"Laurie Crouch: We really are better together, ladies -- Thank God for female friendships",Laurie Crouch,"Sociologists have devoted many hours and words to detangling the mysteries of female friendships. As a wife, mother, daughter and friend that’s been on this earth for a few decades now and participated in many successful — and maaaybe a few possible failed — friendships, there’s a thing or two I could share to save them some time and energy.

Sometimes we make friendship way more difficult than it needs to be.

We avoid confrontation at all costs.

AMERICAN WOMAN, 21, BECOMES YOUNGEST PERSON TO VISIT EVERY COUNTRY

And yes, we always to go the restroom in pairs because that short trip really is better with a friend in tow.

One thing that always remains are the girlfriends God gives you to help you walk through these seasons. We need each other.

But above all, the one thing about women that I believe more than anything else is this: we’re better together.

We’re better when we listen without an agenda.

We’re better when we support instead of compete with each other.

We’re better when we lock arms and stand up for each other’s children.

We’re better when we do whatever it takes to point each other to Christ.

As one author found, women, though thought to be less competitive than men, really just compete with a different currency: we value the degree to which one is privy to the details of her friends’ lives—which is what makes us so prone to gossip.

But the other side of that coin is that women are relational. We care — deeply. And while there might be an underlying drive tinged with a hint of competition, overall, women tend to love each other well. (And mostly hold close each other’s confidences!)

I am fortunate to be surrounded by a group of women who are committed to being there for each other. We’re all different ages and in different stages of life, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t relate. It does mean, however, that sometimes friendship might look a little different or require a bit more effort for one of us than it does for another. But thankfully, there is much love and grace for each other on our journey.

Here are a few ways these women make me better.

They challenge me. As a follower of Christ, I am called to be in relationship with others. The other women in my close circle are Christians, too, and not only challenge me to be a better Christian by reflecting Christ in our personal relationships, but also by reaching out to those who don’t share our faith. They challenge me to be a better mother, a better servant, and a better friend, oftentimes by doing nothing more than being an excellent model of each of these things.

They support me. These women know what’s going on in my life and are my go-to support system. They send me quick text messages to check in on me. They lend a helping hand when they’re able. They pray for me and let me know when they’re thinking about me. They don’t let me walk through this life alone.

They love me. Love can look like many things. For these women, it looks like forgiving me for my shortcomings. It looks like showing up during a stormy season. It looks like holding my hand while I mourn a loss. It looks like giving me their honest opinion and wise advice. These women are Jesus in the flesh when I need Him most.

They encourage me in the Lord. These women know me and they know my heart, therefore, they also know when I need to be reminded of what the Word says about my situation. Their friendship not only makes me a better friend — it makes me a better follower of Christ.

These women do these things for me, and it’s my joy and privilege to do the same for them. We’re meant to walk through this life in community, sharing in each other’s joy and sorrows. We’re meant to be better together.

And as summertime is upon is, mamas with school-aged children will revel in more quality time with their children. I was one of those that was always so excited for summer to start, anticipating the many adventures awaiting us over those special days.

I think if we could just remember to view these days as fresh opportunities to make lasting memories with our kids, it will help you get through the full and sometimes stressful moments that can come along with all the free time they have! Just soak it all up because in the blink of an eye, they’re grown and getting married and out of your house!

One thing that always remains through these changes are the girlfriends God gives you to help you walk through these seasons. We need each other.

Take a minute to identify the women in your life who make you better. Whether they’re mothers, sisters, daughters, friends, or all of the above, these women have shaped us into who we are today and will help us make it through to tomorrow (judgment free!). Don’t let today go by without thanking your tribe for doing life with you. We’re really better together.","One thing that always remains are the girlfriends God gives you to help you walk through these seasons.
But above all, the one thing about women that I believe more than anything else is this: we’re better together.
They challenge me to be a better mother, a better servant, and a better friend, oftentimes by doing nothing more than being an excellent model of each of these things.
These women know what’s going on in my life and are my go-to support system.

108,Bradley Blakeman: Trade pact with Canada and Mexico offers incredible benefits – Congress should approve it,Bradley Blakeman,"Congress should quickly approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the updated and improved version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between our three nations.

Countries that have put tariffs on American products, restricted trade, lied, cheated and stolen from our nation are laughing at our inability to defend ourselves by enacting this fair trade agreement.

Every day that America does not level the trading field we lose jobs, customers and put in peril our present and long-term economic prosperity.

JONAH GOLDBERG: TRUMP MEXICO TARIFF THREAT COULD ‘SCUTTLE’ PLANNED REPLACEMENT OF NAFTA

After years of slow growth and stagnation, the American economy today is robust. Americans are seeing more in their take-home pay. Manufacturing is returning. Jobs that had been moved offshore have come back to America.

To understand just how important trade is with our neighbors to the north and south, you have to appreciate the statistics. Trade with Mexico and Canada supports 12 million U.S. jobs. The Trump administration expects that number will increase to add another 176,000 American jobs when the USMCA is enacted.

Delays in getting needed approval by Congress of the USMCA are further hurting our markets and competition.

Internet industries are stuck with old NAFTA rules that restrict and hamper sales. The USMCA contains modern and up-to-date standards for sales and trade. It also safeguards cross-border data flows and prohibits forced data localization requirements that hamper American competition and control of our data and operations.

Our agricultural sectors are also plagued with antiquated and unfair trade practices and rules under the old NAFTA agreement, which went into effect at the beginning of 1994.

The USMCA will maintain duty-free access for American farmers in Mexico and opens up the Canadian market for the first time to American dairy, wheat, chicken, egg and turkey products.

By approving the USMCA, Congress will enable American farmers and ranchers to expand their operations here and in Canada, and allow them to make investments in personnel, equipment and infrastructure.

The USMCA also will allow for improved health and safety standards that require Mexico and Canada to comply and report on.

The secret to America’s success has been our ability to innovate. The USMCA better protects that by requiring Canada and Mexico to honor our intellectual property and trade secrets.

In addition, the USMCA expedites the patent and approval process in Mexico and Canada, allowing America’s innovative products to be sold in those markets sooner, while protecting them from infringement and theft.

USMCA is the first trade agreement that includes provisions that address the concerns of small and medium-size businesses, which represent 98 percent of our exporters. It also cuts red tape for customs procedures and protocols that have unduly burdened small and medium-size businesses.

America’s greatest asset is our workers. The USMCA includes advanced, comprehensive and enforceable labor obligations that level the playing field and provides opportunity for our workforce.

The agreement also requires Mexico to pass laws overhauling its labor justice system to protect its workers, which in turn creates fairer competition in trade.

On top of this, the agreement will raise the standard of living for American workers by requiring 40 to 45 percent of automobile content to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.

The USMCA will help American manufacturers by maintaining the successful duty-free access of U.S. manufactured goods into Canada and Mexico.

Today, 46 out of 50 states count Mexico and Canada as their first and second-largest foreign purchasers. The USCMA will ensure this trade continues and grows.

U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Canada and Mexico support more than 2 million jobs at 43,000 manufacturing businesses across our country.

Canada and Mexico are the largest purchasers of American manufactured goods – purchasing more than the next 10 U.S. trading partners combined.

America’s premier industry is automobile-related. We need to pass the USMCA to protect it from abuses and unfair trade practices.

The United States Trade Representative estimates that the USMCA will add $34 billion in automotive investment and will create 76,000 new American jobs over 5 years – figures that come from the automobile-related companies themselves.

The USMCA will encourage investment and manufacturing growth in the U.S. by establishing higher content requirements for U.S. components. The agreement also transforms supply chains to use more U.S. content to encourage suppliers to locate future production in the U.S.

Every day that the USMCA goes unsigned, America loses. Friends, adversaries and enemies are looking at the USMCA as a barometer as to how to treat us and what they can get away with.

Now is the time to act. NAFTA is outdated, ineffective and hurtful to our economy and our workers. Letting the USMCA languish is a gross dereliction of duty by Congress.

In addition, the USMCA expedites the patent and approval process in Mexico and Canada, allowing America’s innovative products to be sold in those markets sooner, while protecting them from infringement and theft.

USMCA is the first trade agreement that includes provisions that address the concerns of small and medium-size businesses, which represent 98 percent of our exporters. It also cuts red tape for customs procedures and protocols that have unduly burdened small and medium-size businesses.

America’s greatest asset is our workers. The USMCA includes advanced, comprehensive and enforceable labor obligations that level the playing field and provides opportunity for our workforce.

The agreement also requires Mexico to pass laws overhauling its labor justice system to protect its workers, which in turn creates fairer competition in trade.

On top of this, the agreement will raise the standard of living for American workers by requiring 40 to 45 percent of automobile content to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.

The USMCA will help American manufacturers by maintaining the successful duty-free access of U.S. manufactured goods into Canada and Mexico.

Today, 46 out of 50 states count Mexico and Canada as their first and second-largest foreign purchasers. The USCMA will ensure this trade continues and grows.

U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Canada and Mexico support more than 2 million jobs at 43,000 manufacturing businesses across our country.

Canada and Mexico are the largest purchasers of American manufactured goods – purchasing more than the next 10 U.S. trading partners combined.

America’s premier industry is automobile-related. We need to pass the USMCA to protect it from abuses and unfair trade practices.

The United States Trade Representative estimates that the USMCA will add $34 billion in automotive investment and will create 76,000 new American jobs over 5 years – figures that come from the automobile-related companies themselves.

The USMCA will encourage investment and manufacturing growth in the U.S. by establishing higher content requirements for U.S. components. The agreement also transforms supply chains to use more U.S. content to encourage suppliers to locate future production in the U.S.

Every day that the USMCA goes unsigned, America loses. Friends, adversaries and enemies are looking at the USMCA as a barometer as to how to treat us and what they can get away with.

Now is the time to act. NAFTA is outdated, ineffective and hurtful to our economy and our workers. Letting the USMCA languish is a gross dereliction of duty by Congress.

114,Kristan Hawkins: Georgia boycott is a Hollywood temper tantrum that will hurt women,Kristan Hawkins,"The entertainment industry faces a conundrum as it carries on a widespread temper tantrum aimed at states where legislators acted to protect preborn babies -- raise costs or raise Cain. Currently, threats of economic devastation through loss of jobs and income are being launched at the people of Georgia where a law recently passed limits abortion early in pregnancy, though they are not alone in expressing their pro-life convictions in law.

In response, Hollywood denizens have called for a boycott of the state known to be a cost-effective partner in many media productions. Their message: We won’t come to Georgia to fake kill people in our movies and television shows, unless you kill people for real through abortion.

Georgia is known as one of the best states for filming because of tax incentives that welcome production. The Atlantic reports that the incentives led to ”92,000 jobs and nearly $4.6 billion in wages to the state since 2008.”

NETFLIX, DISNEY CONSIDER BOYCOTTING GEORGIA, CONTINUE PARTNERSHIPS WITH EGYPT, CHINA

Right now, 34 productions are underway in the state, where movies like the ""Hunger Games,"" the Marvel franchise and AMC’s ""The Walking Dead"" have come to life.

The motion picture industry has profited by a partnership with family-friendly Chick-fil-A investment through Pinewood Atlanta Studios, which is currently engaged in a $1 billion production in the state, providing jobs and opportunity despite possible differences in values. And Georgia is not the only state moved to protect life and to be a friend to the film industry, including Louisiana, Alabama and Ohio.

This indignation aimed at Georgia is rather selectively engaged and misses some important details … like whether the celebrities even have any work going and who will really pay the price for lost revenue.

About boycott supporters, The Wrap reports: “Several prominent producers, like Reed Morano and Judd Apatow, have said they would boycott filming in Georgia in response to the law. Producers David Simon, Christine Vachon, Mark Duplass, Nina Jacobson and Neal Dodson have already boycotted shooting in the state altogether — though none of these was known to have any projects slated for production in the state.”

Mega content creator Netflix, which has produced its blockbuster ""Stranger Things"" in Georgia, has pledged to pull its business from the state if the pro-life law goes into effect. Meanwhile, mega content producers like Sony Pictures, WarnerMedia, Disney, CBS (and Showtime), and Viacom say they are taking a wait-and-see approach to states that have both welcomed the film industry with friendly policy and dared to also welcome preborn infants.

AMC TO RETHINK FILMING 'THE WALKING DEAD' IN GEORGIA IF ABORTION LAW TAKES EFFECT

All of the drama ignores the fact that its people in the entertainment industry who may be hurting the most should a boycott take place. As noted by The Atlantic, “Is it really possible for companies to stand with Georgia’s women by threatening to leave thousands of them jobless?”

For all the angst in Hollywood over Georgia’s concerns for the preborn, where is the anger or advocacy over the entertainment industry’s connections to nations like Saudi Arabia and China, Abu Dhabi, Egypt, Dubai, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. The human rights issues related to these countries, including simply allowing women to vote or enter into a contract without permission, are long and well documented. Yet Hollywood turns its wrath on the people of Georgia who for a decade have been a friend to the film industry.

It’s rather tone-deaf of an industry that prospers when telling empathetic stories to choose to become cultural bullies. The people of Georgia, acting through their elected officials, welcomed the film industry to the state with tax incentives and accommodation. And they welcomed both mother and preborn child through a new law that respects the humanity of both.

Maybe the entertainment icons should consider that the future of their industry depends on an audience that deserves respect and a chance at the kind of life enjoyed by those lobbying against actors still in the womb.

While even Disney contemplates rejecting the people of Georgia for their support of young families, the words of Walt Disney are worth repeating: “Our heritage and ideals, our code and standards – the things we live by and teach our children – are preserved or diminished by how freely we exchange ideas and feelings.”","The entertainment industry faces a conundrum as it carries on a widespread temper tantrum aimed at states where legislators acted to protect preborn babies -- raise costs or raise Cain.

115,Paul Batura: Dodgeball isn’t ‘legalized bullying’ – This game has valuable life lessons to teach our kids,Paul Batura,"Academics are meeting in Vancouver, Canada this week as part of the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, an annual gathering designed to both study and challenge longstanding cultural norms.

Believe it or not, included in the myriad of topics on the docket for discussion is the game of dodgeball, a sport that immediately conjures up memories (good and bad) of gym class for almost anyone who attended traditional school as a child.

According to the trio of presenters in Vancouver, dodgeball should be banished to the ash heap of history because it “reinforces the five faces of oppression” – specifically, exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism and violence. One researcher called the game “tantamount to legalized bullying.”

DODGEBALL IS NOT CHILD’S PLAY BUT ‘LEGALIZED BULLYING’ CANADIAN RESEARCHERS CLAIM

Growing up, I always appreciated my teachers and professors and I’m friends today with many people who make their living in the classroom. I have a great deal of respect for higher education.

But I’m immediately suspicious whenever I read academic treatises like this one that uses sophisticated and loaded terms to describe something as simple and straightforward as a game played with soft rubber balls.

Like dodgeball, we’re also called to protect other people in our care or on our team, blocking and shielding them from the “slings and arrows” of everyday life.

In short, many critics of dodgeball don’t like the sport because there are clear winners and losers – and to get there, sometimes the big kids pick on the small ones, albeit at times with unnecessarily cruel tactics.

The origin of dodgeball dates back over 200 years to Africa, where the game was reportedly played with rocks and putrefied matter. It was a fight of the fittest and sometimes turned deadly.

A Christian missionary from England named Dr. James Carlisle was appalled by the bloody and violent nature of the contests, but became intrigued by the agility of the competitors as well as the teamwork that each team employed.

Inspired by the potential he saw in the positive attributes of a game with admittedly negative aspects, he brought the concept back to St. Mary’s College, where soft balls replaced the hard rocks.

That same year visitors from Yale University in the United States, likewise impressed with the game, introduced a version of dodgeball to American students. Phillip Ferguson of Yale is credited with redesigning the game in 1884 and in 1905 he wrote the first official rules.

I loved dodgeball growing up – and still love the game today. I was never the best athlete or the most popular kid in my class, but I held my own and found the action-packed suspense of each contest to be exciting.

Who would be left standing? When Mr. Russ, our elementary school gym teacher, blew that whistle and those red rubber balls started flying, my adrenaline soared liked an eagle in high flight. It was simple fun.

Mr. Russ’ version of the game had a provision that allowed players to re-enter if someone on their team scored a basket on the opponent’s side of the court – a “Hail Mary” shot, to be sure. A highlight of my childhood was sinking one of those tosses – and being mobbed by my fellow teammates as they flooded back onto the floor. It felt good to be needed and come through for them in the end.

Granted, not everybody likes dodgeball – my wife included. But Julie doesn’t see the sport as part of an imperialistic plot to exploit and marginalize kids. Instead, she realizes that you sometimes do things in life that you don’t like and one person’s disdain is often another person’s delight. She likens it to making a kid take a music class, which she loved – but others don’t.

At the root of the visceral and over-the-top reaction to dodgeball is an unfortunate and evolving trend to overreact to anything that may or may not simply need correction. The proverbial phrase of ‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater” comes to mind.

Just because a few bad apples may have unfairly played the game from time to time, does that justify eliminating it? No.

I’m reminded of the push in the early part of the 20th century to ban college football, a movement started due to rising fatalities in the sport.

In response to the escalating furor, President Theodore Roosevelt, a fan of the game and a hearty sportsman himself, convened a meeting at the White House. He urged attendees to amend the rules of the game, which they did, ushering in a new era of the sport. As a result, college football survived – and has thrived ever since.

Like many sports, dodgeball is a metaphor for life. As Julie indicated, sometimes you’re called to play a game you don’t like – and you just have to do the best you can with what you’ve got at the time.

But the applications don’t end there.

Any successful life requires agility and the ability to set a goal and hit your target – and yes, deflect, endure and survive return fire.

Like dodgeball, we’re also called to protect other people in our care or on our team, blocking and shielding them from the “slings and arrows” of everyday life.

Finally, the reality is that like in every game of dodgeball, sometimes you get knocked down and out, even relegated to the sidelines to await the next round.

In the end, though, every setback has within it the seeds of a comeback, and – like the red rubber balls of my dodgeball youth – we’re made to bounce back from any challenge that comes our way.

Washington State Patrol Trooper John Bryant shared on Twitter a photo of the animal taken by a local resident.

According to The Verge, who interviewed Boston Dynamics’ CEO Marc Raibert at Amazon's Re:MARS conference in Las Vegas, Spot, the company's dog-like robot and arguably its cutest machine, will be available for purchase ""within months"" and certainly before the end of 2019.

BOSTON DYNAMICS' TERRIFYING ROBOTS CAN NOW RUN, JUMP AND CLIMB

“We’re just doing some final tweaks to the design,” Raibert said in the interview. “We’ve been testing them relentlessly.”

In October, Boston Dynamics, which is now owned by Japanese conglomerate Softbank, released a video of Spot walking around construction sites in Tokyo as it began to test it ""for commercial usage around the world.""

Though interest in the robots is sure to be high, don't expect to see Spot everywhere like the latest iPhone or available on Amazon.

BOSTON DYNAMICS' LATEST ROBOT CAN OPEN DOORS

“We’re manufacturing them at a reasonably high rate for an early product,” Raibert said, adding that the company is ""aiming for 1,000 a year.” Currently, there are 50 robots available for beta testing.

Raibert refused to give a price for Spot, only stating that the commercial version would be less expensive than its prototypes ""[and] we think they’ll be less expensive than other peoples’ quadrupeds.”

On its website, the company, which got its start at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it is ""changing your idea of what robots can do"" and prides itself ""in building machines that both break boundaries and work in the real world.""

121,"San Francisco is resisting 5G, calling it 'ugly' and 'dangerous'",Brooke Crothers,"High-speed 5G connections are coming to a neighborhood near you. But not everyone wants one in their backyards.

In Upper Cole Valley, a San Francisco community, residents objected to the 5G equipment almost immediately. These objections include networking equipment that some residents deem “ugly” because it doesn’t comport with local aesthetic standards, according to a complaint from a group of Upper Cole Valley residents, as cited in a CityLab report.

Some nearby residents also said that they had not been properly notified by the city about 5G equipment and others cited RF radiation concerns, according to the complaint.

IN GOOGLE'S HOMETOWN, SOME RESIDENTS ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN RVS

The rollout of 5G is only just beginning now across the U.S. and is currently limited to select locations within a handful of cities. When the technology becomes widely available, 5G is expected to offer peak connection speeds that are many times faster than 4G.

Yet, carriers, such as Verizon, are shifting how connectivity is delivered with 5G. They are transitioning from large cell towers to so-called small cells that are often attached to street poles bringing them closer to small communities, causing the issue.

The number of small cells deployed is predicted to jump over the next few years, from 86,000 in 2018 to more than 800,000 by 2026, according to 2018 report from the CTIA, a trade association representing the US wireless communications industry. In 2017, there were about 13,000 small cells.

“This increase underscores the importance of every level of government modernizing its wireless infrastructure rules,” the report added.

So far, the California Supreme Court has thrown a wrench in these plans with an April ruling that said San Francisco can reject 5G wireless equipment that doesn’t meet local aesthetic standards.

The FCC is opposed to excessively strict aesthetic requirements for small cells. While the FCC agrees with aesthetic requirements that are “reasonably directed” to avoid “unsightly or out-of-character deployments,” aesthetic requirements cannot be more burdensome than those applied to other infrastructure equipment, the FCC said last September.

GOOGLE'S ERIC SCHMIDT: BREAKING UP BIG TECH WOULD BE 'ILLEGAL'

Another local concern is exposure to 5G RF radiation. In the Upper Cole Valley complaint, residents were concerned that while they are told exposure is not dangerous, telecom workers are warned to avoid exposure.

“Our current RF exposure limits incorporate recommendations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and other federal health and safety agencies,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wrote in an April 30 letter to Rep. Peter DeFazio (D) of Oregon.

123,Remote Indian reservation near the Grand Canyon gets broadband boost,John Brandon,"Rural Americans are often overlooked in terms of technological innovations. They will be among the last to receive faster 5G cell phone coverage, even though it is now available in major cities. In some rural areas, acquiring an HD television signal is next to impossible.

Yet, for Native Americans living in remote tribal communities, even connecting to high-speed Internet is a struggle, relying instead on archaic dial-up connections.

One study by the American Indian Policy Institute found that about a third of all Native Americans lack broadband access. A study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office disputes that claim, suggesting that access in tribal areas is much worse than that.

RURAL AMERICA STILL STRUGGLING FOR ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICE

Ophelia Watahomigie-Corliss represents the Havasupai tribe near the Grand Canyon, one of the smallest rural communities in the U.S. She tells Fox News the biggest challenge has to do with kids receiving an education, which is harder without broadband.

“[Our schools] only go up to eighth grade and the only option for high school is to move out of the canyon to earn their diploma [due to lack of the Internet],” says Watahomigie-Corliss.

That might change now that the FCC has ruled that some spectrum, known as Educational Broadband Service or EBS, will be dedicated specifically to the Havasupai tribe. The FCC is expected to make a general ruling about spectrum allocation for all tribal areas next month.

AMAZON PLANS TO OFFER SATELLITE-POWERED INTERNET

Even then, there is an issue of installing broadband equipment.

Martin Casado, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is also the founder of the non-profit company MuralNet, which is helping bring broadband to tribal areas. He tells Fox News that the problem is corporate greed. Telecom companies refuse to install the base stations and backhaul locations necessary to make it all work in rural communities.

“Telecoms won’t do this unless you have enough of a population,” he says. “And they don’t know how to make it financially solvent. In Africa, you might not have the basics like electricity, but in the United States we have the infrastructure all in place to make this happen.”

NEW SATELLITES COULD SAVE AMERICANS $30B ON MONTHLY INTERNET BILLS, REPORT SAYS

Casado says MuralNet uses low-cost networking equipment that is then re-programmed with their software. The installs help make broadband access more affordable and viable for rural areas. The company piggybacks on the EBS rulings to provide broadband to tribal residents.

Watahomigie-Corliss says there’s another issue. Some initiatives, such as online school and telemedicine, depend on high-speed Internet. She’s thankful the spectrum is now allocated, but the process of rolling out services that rely on broadband will take time.

Gary Bolton, a spokesperson for the networking company ADTRAN, tells Fox News that there are additional complications. In rural areas, the terrain, which could include mountains or remote farmland -- is more complex and requires more technical planning. “About 19 million Americans are on the losing side of the digital divide,” he says.

In the end, it’s not always easy to provide access to technology and it’s not always lucrative for the telecoms, but for tribal communities in remote areas, it’s an imperative.","In some rural areas, acquiring an HD television signal is next to impossible.

125,Former Bengal charged with assault for attacking wife and sister with golf club in front of son: police,Talia Kaplan,"Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Jonathan Fanene faces kidnapping and assault charges for allegedly using a pipe, broom handle and golf club to assault his sister and wife in front of their 9-year-old son.

Court documents filed this week in the district court of American Samoa revealed the alleged attack on May 26th was over accusations he had an extramarital affair while on a trip to Hawaii.

The couple’s son told police his father ordered him to grab “the bat” and when he couldn’t find one, he brought a golf club, broom handle and a pipe and said he then saw Fanene “use these objects to assault” his mother and aunt, according to court documents.

“He beat them as hard as he can,” Fanene’s son told investigators.

According to the affidavit, he added: “My mom told him to stop, in a crying way.""

PATRIOTS RELEASE FANENE

Fanene’s wife, who police said was covered in bruises on one side of her body, filed the criminal complaint three days after the alleged assault. She told police that her sister-in-law informed her that Fanene was seen in Hawaii with another woman and when she confronted her husband about it he “flew into a rage” and assaulted his sister “with his hands,” according to the affidavit.

She told police that Fanene used the pipe, broom handle and golf club to assault her and her sister-in-law, according the affidavit which also revealed that when his wife was able to grab and remove the pipe and stick from Fanene he allegedly “grabbed a commercial grade extension cord, wound it around his hand, and proceed[ed] to whip her and her sister-in-law with it.”

Fanene’s wife told police that at one point he “hit her so hard that she ‘blacked-out’ momentarily,” adding that she “thought he was going to kill her right there and then.”

The affidavit outlined other alleged assaults dating back to 2009, which included two incidents where Fanene allegedly held a gun to his wife’s head and another alleged attack where he stomped on her head after she found an email he sent to another woman.

ADAM 'PACMAN' JONES, FORMER ALL-PRO DEFENSIVE BACK, ARRESTED AFTER REPORTED INCIDENT CASINO

Fanene was drafted by the Bengals in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL draft and played seven seasons with the team. He played for New England in 2012, but was released after he was injured in training camp.

He most recently served as director of the American Samoa Department of Youth and Women’s Affairs but lost his job after American Samoa’s acting governor, Lt. Gov. Lemanu Palepoi Sialega Mauga, found out about the alleged incident.

“Based on the information I received from the Police Commission, my decision is to terminate Mr. Fanene,” Mauga told the Associated Press on Wednesday.

Fanene, who has been charged with eight felonies and five misdemeanors, has been released on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court next week.

WOMEN'S WORLD CUP: US STARS ALI KRIEGER AND ASHLYN HARRIS SAVOR TOURNAMENT EXPERIENCE AS A COUPLE

The 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup starts on Friday in Reims, France. Returning champions and favorites, the U.S. Women’s National Team, intend to win the trophy…again.

“America likes winners,” noted Kilmeade. “And, while the men struggle, we have talent. We don’t execute in the big tournaments. The women have. They have three World Cups already. Their win in 2015…And, they’re favorites to do it again, but they’re going to have their hands full.”

The team begins their quest to back-to-back championships for the first time in U.S. Women’s National Team history on Tuesday June 11 at 3 PM EST against Thailand. The United States has lifted the trophy more than any other country (in 1991, 1999, and 2015), but Germany is the only nation in the history of the competition to win back-to-back titles in 2003 and 2007.

Casual and hardcore fans alike will recognize some returning U.S. stars. Kilmeade broke down a few key players to root for next week: “Crystal Dunn is probably the biggest name. I think that she’s going to be starting in the back and end up in the front,” he noted.

“I also think you’re going to see some old faces shine,” said Kilmeade. “Number one: Megan Rapinoe will make news or not make news when she decides to take a knee in the national anthem. But, she is one of the best players and will be wearing the captain’s band.”

Rapinoe was the first white athlete to kneel during the national anthem before a sporting event following former NFL star Colin Kaepernick’s decision in 2016.

“And, look out for Alex Morgan,” he warned. “This is her season. This is her time. She’s got 101 goals coming in. And those 101 goals—if she increases that—she’ll be as big as Mia Hamm. As long as she delivers the World Cup title.”

Two-time FIFA Player of the Year and three-time Olympian co-Captain Carli Lloyd came out confident at a press conference in May. ""The term 'defending champions', we won that. Now, 2019, we're actually going to try to win it again, and that's the plan,"" she stated.

We always have that mentality that it doesn't matter. We're going to fight and battle and we're going to come out on top.”

Kilmeade named Sweden, who beat the U.S. in the 2016 Olympics, as an interesting game to watch. England, France, and Germany are also teams to beat. “Women: watch. The key is to have women watch. Not just the men: the women,” he urged.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez quoted a tweet by Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold which linked to an article that revealed documents obtained from Trump hotels. According to the Post's report, an Iraqi sheik reportedly stayed at a suite in Trump's hotel in Washington D.C. for 26 days after urging the Trump administration to take a ""hard-line"" approach towards Iran in July 2018.

""Sure looks like powerful people are trying to bribe the President into war,"" Rep. Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's tweet garnered more than 30,000 likes and 7,000 retweets in under five hours, but responses to her statement were varied.

Concerns about escalating tensions between the United States and Iran prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to proclaim that the Trump administration is ready to sit down with Iran's leaders for a conversation with ""no preconditions.""

He added, however, that ""the American effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of this Islamic Republic, this revolutionary force, is going to continue.""

130,"Google rewards reputable reporting over left-wing politics, Economist study finds",Christopher Carbone,"President Trump and other Republicans have accused Google of anti-conservative bias a number of times over the last few years, while the tech giant has said its algorithm and worker-powered systems don't take ideology into account.

During his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said ""it's not possible for individual employees to manipulate our search results,"" in response to questions about alleged bias.

In an attempt to clear the waters, The Economist set up an experiment that compared the new site's share of search results with a statistical prediction based on its output, reach and accuracy.

YOUTUBE CRACKDOWN BLOCKED HISTORY TEACHERS WHO SHARED ARCHIVE FOOTAGE OF HITLER

The publication wrote a program to obtain Google results for any keyword; then, using a browser with no history, in what they call a ""politically centrist part of Kansas,"" they searched for 31 terms for each day in 2018 — garnering 175,000 links.

""Next, we built a model to predict each site's share of links Google produces for each keyword, based on the premise that search results should reflect accuracy and audience, as Google claims,"" The Economist reports.

The business publication worked with Meltwater, a media-tracking firm, to examine each outlet's popularity on social media, and they used accuracy ratings from several sources, including fact-checking websites, tallies of Pulitzer Prizes and results from a poll by YouGov about Americans' trust in 37 different publications.

These conditions were meant to approximate some of the factors, such as trustworthiness and expertise, that Google uses to determine search results.

US ELECTIONS IN 2020 NEED MASSIVE OVERHAUL TO PROTECT THEM, SECURITY EXPERTS WARN

If the Mountain View, Calif. company favored liberal-leaning sites, they would be expected to appear more often than The Economist's model predicted. But that was not the case.

Their model expected The New York Times to account for 9.2 percent of Google's news results, but it got 7.7 percent. The model predicted Fox News to get 2.6 percent of results, but it actually got 3.2 percent.

""Overall, center-left sites like The New York Times got the most links, but only about as many as our model suggested. Fox News beat its modest expectations. Because far-right outlets had bad trust scores, they got few search results,"" the study concluded. ""But so did Daily Kos, a far-left site.""



Few people understand how Google actually works when you type a query into the box, but the process involves a mix of machines and humans.

The tech company’s crawlers, which are constantly scanning every page on the World Wide Web for new content and links, store copies of the web pages in the company’s massive index — which, if stacked as pages of a book, would stretch to the Moon and back 12 times. The software matches your query with terms on the most relevant pages and ranks those pages based on authoritativeness and relevance prior to producing your results.

THIS UNFINISHED ARIZONA 'FUTURISTIC HIPPIE COMMUNE' HAS A PROBLEM

Meanwhile, the algorithms are constantly being improved: About 10,000 search quality raters around the world are conducting thousands of tightly controlled search experiments – there were 30,000 experiments that resulted in 2,500 changes to search last year – to rate whether results are producing accurate, correct information. The guidelines, which run to 164 pages, give raters a detailed, methodical way to evaluate how a webpage works and whether it delivers quality content for users.

However, the business publication admits that their study does not definitively ""prove"" that bias does not exist — since it can't account for the possible bias or partisanship of fact-checkers or Pulitzer voters.

According to The Economist, Google's main form of favoritism is simply to ""boost viral articles.""

""The most incendiary stories about Mr. Trump come from leftist sources. Gory crime coverage is more prevalent on right-leaning sites. Readers will keep clicking on both.""

141,Bizarre Ford F-150 Raptor spotted. Could it be a new Bronco?,Gary Gastelu,"Ford is rebooting Bronco brand next year with an all-new off-road truck inspired by the 1966 original along with a “Baby” Bronco crossover.

But could a big Bronco also be in the works?

A strange-looking black truck was spotted recently near Ford HQ wearing manufacturer plates that suggests one may be.

It appears to be a Ford F-150 Raptor with a two-door standard cab and a short bed, which doesn’t exist in production. In fact, you can’t buy any F-150 in that configuration.

Put a cap on it, though, and it would look a lot like a modern version of the last F-Series-based Bronco that rolled off the assembly line in 1996, two years after one featured in the infamous O.J. Simpson police chase.

However, automakers often cobble together what are known as “mules” to test new components, and since the truck isn’t wearing any type of disguise its possible that it’s just one of these. A Ford spokeswoman would not comment on the images to Fox News Autos.

A similarly unusual white truck wearing camouflage has also been photographed on public roads that’s based on a Ranger, as the Bronco will be, so it is almost certainly involved in its development in some way.

Since the trucks are significantly different in size and componentry, it’s unlikely the Raptorette has much if anything to do with the announced Bronco. So perhaps Ford does have something big up its sleeve as it continues to shift its lineup away from cars to Trucks and SUVs.

As far as the wood bumpers are concerned, don't expect to see them on the options list.

143,Last Swedish-built Saab 9-3 to be auctioned after being stored since 2014,Gary Gastelu,"The last Saab 9-3 built in Sweden has surfaced and is going up for sale.

The 9-3 sedan came off the assembly line in Trollhattan in 2014 when production was briefly restarted as the bankrupt automaker resurfaced under Chinese ownership as National Electric Vehicle Sweden, or NEVS.

The automaker has since re-engineered the model as a battery-powered car that’s set to go into production in China this year, after 51 percent of the cash-strapped company was purchased by Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group for $930 million.

The 2014 car was the last of 420 produced and was set aside for crash testing that never occurred, according to NEVS.

THIS IS THE CAR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO SAVE SAAB:

Originally designed under General Motors ownership, the silver compact has just 3.1 miles on the odometer – well, technically 5 km – and features a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and automatic transmission.

It will be on display at NEVS HQ in Trollhattan through June 9 and auctioned later this year.

It has not yet been determined where the proceeds from the sale will go.

145,Walmart CEO says a change in step stools will save the company $30M: report,Elizabeth Zwirz,"Walmart’s top executive reportedly shared a seemingly simple solution on Friday that he said is expected to save his company at least $30 million this year.

Continue Reading Below

The change at the company’s distribution centers involves doing away with “clunky, big and heavy” step stools and alternatively using lighter ones, the company’s chief executive officer Doug McMillon said, according to CNBC.

He shed light on the multimillion-dollar savings concept at Walmart’s investors conference, the outlet said.

Walmart reportedly wants their tractor trailers filled to the top with goods in an effort to be efficient and reduce expenses.

The company gave its employees a step stool to help achieve this goal but it was bulky, McMillon said. As a result, it reportedly fell into disuse and the tractor trailers weren’t getting completely filled.

“We're very, extremely disappointed in hearing that today. You know, we've been through, perhaps we thought the darkest days were behind us, given the previous administration's attack and war on our business,” he told FOX Business’ David Asman during an interview on Friday.

The billionaire announced that he will donate $500 million to close all of the nation’s coal plants by 2030. The Beyond Carbon initiative was created to bypass the federal government and work with states and utilities to “phase out every last U.S. coal-fired power plant by 2030.""

“Frankly, we're real disappointed in the mayor that he would select to come after our coal miners and our coal mining families in the states like West Virginia that rely so heavily on coal-fired electric generation and coal mining and all the support jobs that really drive our economy here. And we're not alone,” Hamilton said on ""Bulls & Bears.""

There are about 15 states like West Virginia where coal mining and coal-fired electrical generation play a big role in the local and statewide economies, he said.

147,Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave this advice to those considering starting their own business,Kathleen Joyce,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos knows what it takes to be a successful businessman.

Continue Reading Below

Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 as an online book store. From there, the business expanded to the empire it is today. Bezos, Forbes’ richest person in the world, was asked at the Re: MARS conference Thursday in Las Vegas what advice he would give to those who were considering starting their own business.

“If you want to be an entrepreneur, the most important thing is to be customer obsessed,” Bezos told the crowd. “Don’t satisfy your customers, figure out to how to absolutely delight them. That is the number one thing. Whoever your customers are.”

The second thing a potential entrepreneur needs is passion, Bezos said.

“You have got to have some passion for the arena you’re going to develop and work in,” the CEO said. “Otherwise, you’re going to be competing against people who do have passion for that and they’re going to build better products and services.”

Bezos also said an entrepreneur should be a missionary, not a mercenary. Missionaries “always end up making more money” and build better products.

“They always win,” Bezos said.

Next, the Amazon founder said an entrepreneur should be willing to take risks no matter the outcome.

“You have to take risks,” he said. “You have to be willing to take risks. If you aren’t going to take risks. If you come up with a business idea and there’s no risk there, it’s probably already being done.”

The billionaire said it was possible the risk may not work but that’s OK. He said Amazon always gambled.

“You have to accept that your business is going to be in many ways an experiment and it might fail and that’s OK,” Bezos said. “That’s what risk is. The good news is that Amazon we still take risks all the time. We encourage it. We talk about failure. We should be failing.”

Bezos said failures only made the company grow.

“We need to have like billion dollar scale failure and if we’re not then we’re not swinging hard enough,” he said.

“You don’t say ‘I’m right on this, go do this,’ you say ‘I want you to gamble with me on this,’” he said.

148,"Trump administration announces plan for expanded hunting, fishing access across 1.4 million protected acres",Janine Puhak,"In a bid to increase access to public lands, the Interior Department unveiled a proposal for new and expanded hunting and fishing access to 1.4 million acres in 46 states.

The plan, announced Wednesday, would open 74 national wildlife refuges and 15 national fish hatcheries operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to outdoor sporting enthusiasts.

“Hunting and fishing are more than just traditional pastimes as they are also vital to the conservation of our lands and waters, our outdoor recreation economy, and our American way of life,” U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said of the news. “These refuges and hatcheries provide incredible opportunities for sportsmen and women and their families across the country to pass on a fishing and hunting heritage to future generations and connect with wildlife.”

GRIZZLY BEARS ON MOVE IN ROCKIES AS HUNTING IS IN LIMBO

In addition, the department plans to revise hunting and fishing rules at refuges in all states to more closely match state regulations.

Last September, land managers of the Interior Department compared federal and state hunting and fishing regulations with a goal of streamlining policies in all 50 states; the review was the first of its kind for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

“Well managed hunting and fishing are the backbone of conservation in this country, but inconsistent or overly complex regulations can act as a disincentive,” Service Principal Deputy Director Margaret Everson said in the Interior Department’s formal press release. “By aligning our refuge regulations with our state partners, we are reducing confusion and the regulatory burden on the American public, helping ensure the tradition and benefits of hunting and fishing can continue.”

""It's a dramatic statement about our commitment to access. The goal is to get more people out,” Bernhardt further elaborated of the pitch.

According to the official, a lack of access to hunting and fishing sites is one of the most common reasons Americans don’t participate in these activities.

Reps for groups including the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Delta Waterfowl and the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation were thrilled by the news, as per the release, with some social media commenters echoing similar applause.

""Awesome,"" one Twitter user wrote of the news.

“Hunting and fishing have long been two of the greatest conservation methods available,” another agreed.

“I think it is important to remember that wildlife population control is and should be a major part of refuge management to help maintain the overall health of the refuge,” another offered.

""Of course the comments are full of people who don't understand that hunting is conservation. Hope no one here complaining goes to national parks or anything, or enjoys wildlife,"" one suggested.

Other people, meanwhile, were more skeptical of the proposal's potential impact.

“This is horrible — those restrictions were put in place for specific reasons. Another blow to our Natural America,” one said.

“It just saddens me. I could not believe that really happened to us,” Rackley told KMOV. “I could not believe that still really happens in this world today.”

According to Brown, a woman on the other end of the line was willing to make dinner reservations for the group, but changed her mind upon asking for the “groom’s name” and learning there wouldn’t be one.

“She said, 'Your spouse is a woman?’” Brown said. “I said yes. And she said, ‘I’m sorry we are going to defer you to someone else because we don’t condone that kind of relationship.”

Brown said the woman also told her she was in an “unhealthy relationship.” Rackley added that she was appalled by the woman's comments, which made her feel “less than human.”

158,How Jon Bon Jovi and Jesse Bongiovi turned Hampton Water Rosé into more than just a celebrity brand,Emily Deciccio,"Jesse Bongiovi, 24, dove straight into the world of rosé on a challenge from his dad, legendary rocker Jon Bon Jovi.

It all started one night while Jesse and his Notre Dame roommate, Ali Thomas, were at his house in the Hamptons, and Jesse's dad offered them some rosé wine he jokingly referred to as ""pink juice.""

But Jesse tells Fox News that he and Ali already had their own nickname for rosé, which they usually only drank in the Hamptons.

“We said, ‘No, no, listen. Dad, you’re sitting in the Hamptons, you’re drinking Hampton Water,’"" he remembered telling his father. ""Then he did the cartoon double-take and looked at us, and said, ‘That’s hilarious, can you imagine if someone put that on a bottle?’”

CENTURIES-OLD WINE DISCOVERED IN ANCIENT SHIPWRECK

Jesse says his dad challenged the two college seniors to figure out the rosé business, and if this was something they were really interested in pursuing — and Jesse and Ali accepted. Soon, they were meeting with restaurant owners to see what they liked and disliked in rosés, and learning the logistics of importing wines and creating a design for their bottle.

“By the end of six months, we had a fully formed idea, business plan and marketing strategy,” explains Jesse. “Then we showed my dad everything we had, and the name Gérard Bertrand came up.”

Bertrand, who just happened to be a family friend, is a highly acclaimed winemaker who has been making wine in the South of France for over three decades. In fact, Bertrand is reportedly poised to take the No. 1 spot as the largest importer of French wine to the United States. And Jesse explained that once Bertrand was involved, everything “snowballed” from there.

Jesse, Ali and Jon weren't interested in “white-labeling” – or simply rebranding – an existing product. They also knew that getting someone as renowned as Bertrand on board would give the brand credibility and validity.

“We knew that if we just white-labeled a bottle, that people were going to be like, ‘What the hell does Jon Bon Jovi know about making rosé?’ and that they wouldn’t take it very seriously. But if we partnered with someone who is a second-generation winemaker, is one of the top winemakers in the South of France — people who might not have taken us seriously would take him seriously.”

RED OR WHITE? WINE PREFERENCE REVEALS DETAILS OF YOUR PERSONALITY, STUDY SAYS

After creating the actual rosé with Bertrand, the Hampton Water brand launched in April 2017 — and the 2017 production even sold out before its official release. The rosé reached critical acclaim in 2018, when Hampton Water ranked No. 83 on Wine Spectator's Top 100 list, and was also named the magazine’s best rosé of 2018.

Now, for Jesse it’s about keeping that momentum and not being labeled as a ""celebrity brand.""

“We knew that with an asset like my dad, and [his] name recognition, we’d have a great launch and get the brand out initially, but we know that if we’re not getting liquid into lips, it’s all for naught.”

Jesse tells Fox News that he and Ali are crisscrossing the country to ensure they are constantly meeting with restaurants and liquor stores to get the word out. “Our running joke is that we sleep at Terminal 5 in LaGuardia Airport.”

While Jesse and Ali are traveling across the country, Jesse says his dad has been an invaluable asset as someone to bounce ideas off when it comes to audience and marketing. Jesse also revealed that he and Ali also have an unexpected nickname for his dad.

“We like to call my dad the ‘Easter Bunn,’ and when we’re having a hard time with a place, my dad will stop in for lunch, and be like ‘Have you heard of Hampton Water?'… That’s kind of been our secret weapon when we need to get the really big things done, which has been really helpful to have.”

Jesse says the plan for Hampton Water is to grow and to disprove the summer-seasonality stereotype of rosé and move to make it into a year-round drink.

“Essentially our plan is to double the 500,000 bottles that we did last year. And we plan to do a million bottles this year, and we’re well on our way to doing that.”

#1. There seem to be two National Doughnut Days: The first is celebrated on the first Friday in June, while a second lesser-known observance takes place in early November. The first (in June) was declared in 1938 by the Salvation Army to honor the volunteers, or ""Dough Lassies,"" who made and served doughnuts to troops fighting during the first World War. The origins of November's Doughnut Day are more obscure, with some saying it began as part of a bakery's Veterans Day promotion, and others writing that a hungry Vietnam POW named Orson Swindle convinced his captors that November 10th was a huge holiday (National Doughnut Day), which surprisingly resulted in the jailers ordering everybody sticky buns.

NATIONAL DOUGHNUT DAY'S BEST DEALS

#2. There are far more Dunkin Donuts locations per capita in Massachusetts than any other state, with Slate.com estimating one location for every 6,500 people as of 2014. That said, the Boston news affiliate that once described this Dunkin Donuts truck as ""the most Boston thing ever"" is probably right on the money:

#3. The earliest cakey pastries to resemble doughnuts were spherical rather than ring-shaped (see oliekoeks, or oliebollen, below). It's unclear exactly when rings became popular, but, by his own account, a New England sailor named Hanson Crockett Gregory claims that he originated the idea. As the story goes, he cut the center from his mother's doughnuts (she packed them for him and his shipmates) because the dough was still raw in the middle. He returned home with the idea, and the ring became a thing.

#4. On New Year's Eve in the Netherlands, the Dutch traditionally eat oliebollen, or small doughnuts studded with dried fruit. The tradition of eating oliebollen (literally ""oil balls"") is thought to have originated with early Germanic tribes as a way to ward off the pagan goddess Perchta, who would fly through the skies during Yule and slice open the bellies of disobedient tribespeople. Anyone who had eaten oliebollen, however, was spared, as Perchta's sword would slide off their full, greasy bellies.

#5. Before Clark Gable did it in the 1934 film ""It Happened One Night,"" the practice of dunking doughnuts into coffee wasn't very widespread. (It's rumored to have first gained popularity within celebrity circles after silent actress Mae Murray dropped a doughnut into her coffee at Lindy's in New York.) In fact, in that same year, comedian Red Skelton developed an entire routine based around the different ways people dunk their doughnuts, which he would later perform in the 1938 film ""Having Wonderful Time.""

#6. Speaking of dunking, etiquette expert Emily Post publicly declared her distaste for the practice in 1941, writing that it's ""as bad an example of table manners as can be found."" She did, however, offer an alternative: ""Drop a mouthful at a time into the coffee and then lift it to your mouth with the spoon."" (Even still, she insists this wouldn't be proper manners. ""It's only better than worst,"" she wrote.)","But on a day like National Doughnut Day, we tend to crave something more substantial.

161,Single dad and company president urges people to stop apologizing for 'having lives' in viral essay,Janine Puhak,"One dad and company president from Chicago is winning applause for his empathetic message in a now-viral essay on LinkedIn, in which he begs people to stop apologizing for “having lives” in a culture where “constant connectivity” is an unspoken expectation of many jobs.

Last week, Ian Sohn, the president of Wunderman Chicago, a creative, data and technology agency, took to the career networking platform to implore followers to not feel guilty for having to prioritize the “life” aspect of their work/life balance – especially while raising children.

In the post, which has garnered nearly 19,000 likes and more than 700 comments, Sohn opines that from a management perspective, he “never needs to know” if staffers can work online after dinner, eschewed professional emailing on a flight in favor of watching “Arrested Development,” or plan to leave work early for their kid’s soccer game.

FAMILY STAGES SKYDIVING GENDER REVEAL

“I never need to know why you can’t travel on a Sunday. I never need to know why you don’t want to have dinner with me when I’m in your town on a Tuesday night,” the father of sons 12 and 8 wrote online, USA Today reports. “I never need to know that you’re working from home today because you simply need the silence.”

“I deeply resent how we’ve infantilized the workplace. How we feel we have to apologize for having lives. That we don’t trust adults to make the right decisions,” Sohn continued. “How constant connectivity/availability (or even the perception of it) has become a valued skill.”

“I never want you to feel horrible for being a human being,” he concluded.

Sohn’s stance on the often-debated, delicate balance of personal and professional obligations has since been hailed as refreshingly honest and “amazing” by commenters.

“As a single dad of three boys this is the most refreshing post I have read about work life balance. Thank you for this!” one user exclaimed. “People don’t leave bad companies they leave bad managers.”

“This is great! Not a single parent... but I also believe this applies to everyone. (And Arrested Development seasons 1-3 are fantastic,)” another agreed.

As for the essay’s wider impact, Sohn told USA Today that he was surprised some people went so far as to describe him as “brave” for sharing his views.

""Like any modern business ... there's an additional need to respect other people's lives and environment you work in, and everyone is accountable for getting their job done,” the Wunderman president mused.

163,Many Americans are experiencing ‘workout hangovers' from intense exercise routines,Dr. Aaron Hinde,"A sizable chunk of Americans are skipping work due to hangovers… from exercise.

According to new research, more than one in four active Americans (29 percent) have skipped out on work due to a workout “hangover” (post-exercise soreness that impedes one’s ability to participate in other life and work activities).

STUDY: MANY FITNESS ENTHUSIASTS MIXING WEED WITH WORKOUTS

According to the new study, as many as 55 percent have suffered a workout hangover that’s caused them to stay inside all day, and a possible major cause of this may be that sixty percent of those surveyed said they don’t know enough about dietary and recovery supplements to make an informed decision about what process or products can help them.

Due to that knowledge gap, nearly half of those respondents (47 percent) have skipped recovery steps altogether.

In fact, the new study of 2,000 Americans who exercise uncovered that 65 percent have sustained injuries from their workouts — approximately three each year on average.

The most common injuries? Pulled muscles (68 percent), ankle sprains (48 percent), and knee strains (45 percent).

And the dreaded “workout hangover” is not just affecting work attendance, it has spread into American’s social lives, as well. Forty percent of respondents reported that post-workout muscle soreness has caused them to skip a party. Thirty-nine percent have skipped a get together with friends, and 32 percent have even had to skip dates.

“So much emphasis has been placed on what you consume or drink before a workout, when in actuality it’s what your body needs to help it recover afterward that makes the real difference.” — Dr. Aaron Hinde, co-founder of LIFEAID Bev Co.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The new survey, conducted by OnePoll on behalf of health brand LIFEAID Beverage Co., found that when respondents go too hard in a workout without the proper preparation, their lives become messier.

Fitness-focused Americans spend about one fourth (23 percent) of their typical workout going “too hard,” then paying the price in the form of workout injuries and increased recovery time.

Respondents skip approximately 36 workouts a year due to the dreaded workout hangover. Why all the soreness? It may have something to do with incomplete workout recovery techniques.

In fact, 40 percent of respondents don’t stretch to aid in workout recovery. More than one in three (36 percent) don’t get enough rest after working out, and over half (53 percent) don’t take supplements.

Dr. Aaron Hinde, co-founder of LIFEAID Bev Co., stated, “Proper workout and exercise techniques go hand in hand with post-workout recovery. By helping to improve the speed and efficiency of recovery, one can directly help optimize their overall fitness in a whole new way by increasing strength, endurance... you name it.”

Hinde continues, “So much emphasis has been placed on what you consume or drink before a workout, when in actuality it’s what your body needs to help it recover afterward that makes the real difference.”

“Physical and mental fatigue from working out, particularly with today's more intense exercise routines, is manageable and avoidable with the right nutritional education and recovery products, including specially-formulated drinks and supplements,” said Dr. Hinde. “The key to avoiding the workout hangover is finding what type of products work best for your personal exercise regime, to help you recover as efficiently and effectively as possible.”","A sizable chunk of Americans are skipping work due to hangovers… from exercise.

Her 965-word, June 5 article dresses down President Trump, the First Lady-- and to a lesser extent-- his family – for what she called poor fashion sensibilities during an appearance the Buckingham Palace Banquet this week.

Givhan goes on to equate fashion with diplomacy. With this equation, Givhan’s concludes, we can gain subtle insights into the president’s mind.

“For any man to bungle white-tie dress – something so regimented, so steeped in tradition, so well-documented – he must be a man who doesn’t bother with the details, who doesn’t avail himself of ready expertise, who refuses to be a student of history or even of Google,” Givhan writes. “White-tie attire is more science than art.”

She goes on in pain-staking detail to lay out how a white-tie outfit should be properly worn, and how, in her view, the “president’s iteration of white tie at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace was, in a word, a mess.”

WHY DID MELANIA TRUMP, QUEEN ELIZABETH, KATE MIDDLETON AND CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES ALL WEAR WHITE TO THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE BANQUET?

Givhan then turned her critiques to First Lady Melania Trump's outfits. Though her descriptions were far less critical, Givhan surmises that the First Lady’s choices told “a deliberate fashion story, not one rooted in historical truth.”

“(Melania) Trump often looked like she was a fashion trooper on a stealth mission,” Givhan writes.

And though Trump’s “adult” children” looked “slightly better” in their white tie than their father did, they looked equally as uncomfortable in Givhan’s view.

167,New Mexico AG issues health warning after 'vampire facial' clients contract HIV at spa,Michael Bartiromo,"New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas has issued a consumer health warning concerning “vampire facials” after two former patients from an Albuquerque spa tested positive for HIV.

“I am highly concerned that these procedures are not being regulated at the State and Federal level and am announcing a criminal investigation into this incident,” said Balderas in a release by his office.

“In addition, I am calling for action by the FDA and State Attorneys General across the nation. We cannot allow more people to fall victim.”

MARCIA CROSS SAYS ANAL CANCER LIKELY LINKED TO HUSBAND'S THROAT CANCER

Banderas’ health warning, issued on Thursday, comes just over a month after the New Mexico Department of Health encouraged clients of the VIP Spa in Albuquerque to get tested for HIV after two former patients tested positive for the virus following “injection-related” procedures.

""The likelihood that these [cases] resulted from a procedure at the spa are high,” Dr. Tierney Murphy of the health department stated at the time, KRQE reported.

As of late April, over 130 former clients had gone in for testing.

“I am highly concerned that these procedures are not being regulated at the State and Federal level and am announcing a criminal investigation into this incident."" — New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas

“Vampire facials,” or Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapies, can only be carried out by licensed nurses or physicians, the attorney general reiterated.

Maria Ruiz, the owner of the VIP Spa, held a cosmetologist’s license, which is not valid for medical procedures, KOAT reported.

""That's way beyond her scope of practice as an aesthetician, so that would not be something that we would even license,"" Kathy Ortiz, the deputy director for Boards and Commissions, told KRQE in APril. ""First off, she didn't have a license, so that was basically why we were able to close the establishment.”

KENTUCKY TODDLER'S TICK BITE CAUSED RARE DISEASE, MOM WARNS

While some believe the “vampire facial” can be effective, scientific studies have yet to prove long-lasting effects of the procedure, which involves extracting platelets from a client’s blood and injected those platelets back into the patient’s face through micro-needling. Doctors also deem the procedure itself relatively safe, but there’s always risk when it comes to handling blood.

""The risk of infection using blood products is greater than using sterile injectibles,"" New York City-based plastic surgeon Michelle Copeland, M.D., previously told Fox News. ""It's not a closed syringe, so there is a risk when transferring the product from one tube to another.""

Urging anyone in New Mexico who believes they may have received a vampire facial from an unlicensed cosmetologist, or believe they were exposed to a communicable disease, to contact the attorney general’s office.

169,New York doctors shocked by what they find during surgery on brain tumor,Brie Stimson,"Doctors at Mount Sinai in New York, who cut into a 42-year-old woman’s brain last September to remove a suspected malignant tumor, were reportedly baffled when they found a mass resembling a “quail’s egg.""

It turned out to be a baby tapeworm.

“It was very shocking,” one of the surgeons told The Washington Post. “We were scratching our heads, surprised at what it looked like.”

HOW AN INFANT'S TUMOR HAD FULLY FORMED TEETH INSIDE

After doctors removed the mass from Rachel Palma's brain they cut it open and placed it under a microscope. They realized it was a tapeworm in the larval stage.

Palma, a newlywed, was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, a parasitic brain infection caused by the Taenia solium tapeworm, according to The Post.

“Of course I was grossed out,” Palma told The Post. “But of course, I was also relieved. It meant that no further treatment was necessary.”

Larval tapeworm parasites are rare, according to the Mayo Clinic, but can be spread by people who have adult tapeworms and don't wash their hands properly after going to the bathroom. It’s unclear if that’s how Palma contracted it.

Before the surgery, Palma had suffered from hallucinations, headaches and confusion. She told The Post her symptoms have completely gone away and she got a ""happy ending.""","Doctors at Mount Sinai in New York, who cut into a 42-year-old woman’s brain last September to remove a suspected malignant tumor, were reportedly baffled when they found a mass resembling a “quail’s egg.""

170,Chegg announces student loan payoff program for employees,Kathleen Joyce,"Chegg, an online learning service, announced Thursday that it was launching an equity program to help its employees pay off their student loans.

“Under the Equity for Education program, Chegg has created an equity pool from their existing pool of stock which will be used to pay down U.S. employees' educational loans,” the company said in a statement.

Chegg took the initiative and called on politicians in Washington, D.C. to support similar programs. The company said other companies should follow suit on their model for its employees.

""We realize the amount of debt that is taken on to pursue higher education is crushing our students, hurting families, and our economy, and we want to make an impact on the problem now. We are announcing our Equity for Education plan because we want to encourage other companies to create similar programs for their employees,"" Dan Rosensweig, the CEO and president of Chegg, said in a statement. ""The student debt statistics are daunting, and we believe it's going to take a village to solve this problem.""

Rosensweig said he believed the program would “ultimately benefit the company.”

“We believe that young Americans and their families deserve the opportunity to advance their lives through education,” he said.

The program would apply to any American employee working for the learning platform with student debt. Those who have worked at Chegg for two years will get up to $5,000 a year. Those who are at a director or vice president level can receive up to $3,000 a year.

""These new equity grants are in addition to the $1,000 cash that employees with student debt already receive each year from Chegg,"" Jenny Brandemuehl, Chief People Officer of Chegg, said in a statement. ""We believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit, which is why we also provide an additional $5,250 non-taxed reimbursement to every Chegg employee for continuing education, so they can continue to invest in their future.""

182,"Massachusetts police K-9 adopted after losing leg, job to cancer",Stephen Sorace,"A former Massachusetts police K-9 who was forced into retirement after losing its leg to cancer has found a new home, officials said Wednesday.

The three-legged Bloodhound, Blue, was diagnosed in April with a soft tissue sarcoma, a type of cancer that requires rapid intervention to prevent the disease from spreading to vital organs, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) said in a news release earlier this month.

FLORIDA RESCUE DOG, DEER PLAY FRIENDLY GAME OF TAG IN HILARIOUS VIDEO

Doctors determined the 3-year-old dog’s best chance at survival was amputating his front right leg, where the growth had formed, the release said. The surgery effectively ended his career catching criminals with the Billerica Police Department’s K-9 unit.

But the MSCPA announced Wednesday the 3-year-old dog is now “thriving” with his new adoptive family, which includes another rescued Bloodhound named Gertrude.

“We're no longer blue bc Blue is adopted!” MSPCA-Angell tweeted Wednesday, along with photos of the happy dog.

184,San Diego hospital announces birth of world’s tiniest surviving baby,Louis Casiano,"A San Diego hospital on Wednesday announced the birth of what's thought to be the world's tiniest surviving baby, who weighed just 8.6 ounces and was smaller than an apple.

Baby Saybie -- a name used by her care team -- was born in December 2018 and discharged this month from the Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns as a healthy five-pound infant, the hospital said in a news release. She is believed to be the world's smallest surviving newborn, according to the Tiniest Babies Registry, which is maintained at the University of Iowa.

WORLD'S 'SMALLEST SURVIVING BABY BOY' DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL

Her mother gave birth via emergency cesarean section at 23 weeks' gestation. She weighed seven grams less than the previous smallest surviving newborn, who was born in Germany in 2015, according to the hospital.

""She was small and fragile, and could fit in the palm of the hands of her care team,"" the hospital said.

Doctors said the premature birth was necessary because Saybie was not gaining weight and her mother's life was at risk. She was considered a micropreemie, a baby born before 28 weeks. That early a birth comes with a host of life-threatening medical challenges, the hospital said.

""Saybie experienced virtually none of the medical challenges typically associated with micropreemies, which can include brain bleeds and lung and heart issues,"" it said.

185,"Army veteran’s family demand answers after he died in Pennsylvania jail, had brain, heart and throat removed",Lucia Suarez Sang,"The family of an Army veteran is demanding answers from Pennsylvania authorities more than a year after he mysteriously died inside a local jail and had his organs removed but never returned.

Everett Palmer Jr, 41, had traveled from his home in Delaware to Lancaster County, Pa., on April 7, 2018, to resolve an outstanding warrant for a DUI charge.

What was supposed to be a routine trip en route to New York ended in tragedy when the father of two boys died two days later at the York County Prison.

“We want answers. We want to understand what happened,” his brother Dwayne Palmer told NY1.

PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN, 51, DIED IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AS THREE AMERICAN TOURISTS AT DOMINICAN RESORT A YEAR AGO

An autopsy report from the York County Coroner states Palmer died after an incident in the prison where he became agitated in his cell and was later restrained. The cause of death was later updated to “complications following an excited state, associated with methamphetamine toxicity, during physical restraint.”

The family still knows little about what occurred in the lead up to Palmer’s untimely death. More troubling was when his family received the body, it was badly bruised and his brain, heart, and throat had been removed.

Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney representing the family, told the Washington Post that the body parts went missing for several months and had not been returned to the family.

“So much mystery and unanswered questions in a way that violates every policy and procedure that state has,” he added. “It’s not uncommon to remove body parts in an autopsy in order to perform a test. The only thing that’s highly uncommon is to not know where they are.”

Merritt did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment on Friday.

COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD BE RAZED BECAUSE OF 'MORBID FASCINATION,' OFFICIAL SAYS

The coroner’s report, posted by the Washington Post, said Palmer was restrained after “hitting his head against the inside of his cell door,” and was taken to the prison’s clinic, where he was “noted to be unresponsive.” He was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m. on April 9, 2019.

The family hired an independent pathologist, who first flagged the missing organs, and said the manner of death should be considered a homicide, Merritt told the Washington Post.

The Pennsylvania State Police has said that is investigating in conjunction with the York County district attorney. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office told Fox News on Thursday that it does not comment on pending or on-going investigations.

Meanwhile, the family is still seeking an explanation. His mother, Rose Palmer, told NY1 that the behavior described in the coroner’s report was out of character.

“My son was a perfectly healthy man, and my son is not going to band his head on a cell,” she said. “My son was not a troublemaker, not at all, he was a very gentle, kind man.”

The family said they hope the renewed interest in the case will prompt more information to be released or witnesses to come forward. They have also started a Justice4Everett Facebook page and hashtag.

“My brother was a good man, he comes from a good family, if he did something wrong with regards to the DUI then clearly he should be held accountable for that,” Dwayne Palmer told NY1. “But that should not be a death sentence.”","We want to understand what happened,” his brother Dwayne Palmer told NY1.

192,Tuskegee Airman recounts experience in World War II and the struggles faced by first African-American pilots,Anna Hopkins,"A day after the 75th anniversary of D-Day, 94-year-old Tuskegee Airman Lt. Col. Harry Stewart appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the significance of being one of the first African-American army pilots in World War II.

Lt. Col. Stewart told host Steve Doocy on Friday morning the tale of his first mission with the U.S. Army - a ""huge armada"" of 500 B-24 and B-17 bombers traveling from Italy to northern Europe. African-American pilots were allowed to fight for the first time in World War II under the condition that they trained in a segregated unit, dubbed the Tuskegee Airmen.

""It was really rare because just before then, African-Americans were not accepted for pilot training into the Army Air Corps,"" said Lt. Col. Stewart, who dreamed of being a pilot since he was 18.

These memories are particularly vivid for him now because of the anniversary of D-Day, he said. Stewart added that when he returned safely from the war, the recognition of the service of African-American pilots was not widely appreciated.

""It was the same old, same it was before we went into World War II,"" he said. ""Recognition was long-coming, and it didn't start coming until maybe the 1970s. And it is still coming along now.""

When he came back from the war, Stewart attempted to become an airline pilot but was not permitted because he was African-American.

193,Annual 'Day of Service' to offer free dental care for veterans,Alexandria Hein,"Thousands of veterans will be offered free dental care on Saturday in Delta Dental’s sixth annual Day of Service event. More than 450 Aspen Dental-affiliated offices will open their doors to veterans across the nation as part of the Healthy Mouth Movement, which has donated more than $15 million in dentistry since its installment in 2014.

“Breaking down barriers to care is at the very core of what we do,” Dr. Anita Imadomwanyi, director of clinical support and charitable giving, said. “The Healthy Mouth Movement and annual Day of Service are continuously among the most impactful initiatives that we champion at Aspen Dental, as they fill the underserved gap in the industry that continues to delay veteran access to necessary dental care.”

TRUMPET USED ON D-DAY RETURNS TO NORMANDY FOR 75TH ANNIVERSARY

Veterans can set up appointments through the 844-277-3646 Aspen Dental phone service to find participating offices in their area. Last year, more than 4,300 veterans took part in the event at over 400 Aspen Dental offices. Dr. Jere Gillan, an airman-turned-dentist, said the day offers him the opportunity to connect with fellow veterans who have had life experiences similar to his own.

“It warms my heart every time I get to meet somebody that’s kind of been through the same thing I have, or we have similar experiences,” Gillan, who practices in Orlando, Fla., told Fox News last year. “I was very fortunate when I left the service to finish college and go on to become a dentist — but I know a very small percentage have had my experience, it’s mostly the opposite.”

Aspen Dental has over 750 affiliated offices in 39 states. Gillan said that the biggest investment for the Day of Service comes from “volunteers, doctors and teams that are there.”

194,D-Day combat patches reproduced by California company honoring US soldiers,William La Jeunesse,"To honor the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy, a California company is reproducing combat patches from D-Day and making them available to relatives of those who fought in that epic battle.

""It is our way of giving back to the men and women who fight for our country,"" says Ira Newman of Action Embroidery of Ontario, Calif.

The U.S. Army is unique among military branches in that all soldiers are required to wear a shoulder patch identifying their units. To those who serve, the patch is more than cloth and thread. It represents a brotherhood, lost or forgotten friends and a link to those who came before.

""He got shot twice in Germany and got wounded coming down,"" said Barry Moss, a Marine-turned military librarian. His father parachuted into Normandy while serving with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day.

""They had guys they served with and the next thing you know they were not there anymore,"" said Moss, recalling one of the few stories his father shared about the war. Like many families, his father's uniform and other memorabilia are in the attic.

U.S. forces invading Normandy were composed mainly of the following Army units: The First Army under Gen. Omar Bradley, the Fifth and Seventh Corps, the First, 4th and 29th Infantry Divisions, the 2nd Ranger Battalion and two airborne divisions, the 101st and 82nd.

Shoulder sleeve insignia, or SSI, are made to precise, government specs.

199,D-Day veteran John McHugh recalls Normandy invasion: It was hell on earth,Joseph Wulfsohn,"In an appearance on ""Shepard Smith Reporting,"" World War II Army Cpl. John McHugh on Thursday recalled his harrowing experience as one of thousands of troops storming the beaches of Normandy, describing what he witnessed as ""hell on earth.""

Marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the 95-year-old first-generation Irish-American told how he had to crawl to safety, armed with nothing but a pistol after the machine gun-holding soldier he'd been partnered with died.

""You can't really describe D-Day. You’re so, you’re petrified. You’re absolutely petrified,” McHugh said. “A guy falling over there, a guy falling over there. It’s hell. It’s just hell on earth. I can’t describe it any better. I don’t think anyone can really describe it. ... Needless to say, I had a bad day.”

McHugh told Fox News anchor Shepard Smith that he ""just kept crawling"" up the beach, targeted by armed enemies he could not see.

“And as you crawled along the beach, what were you seeing and hearing?” asked Smith.

“A lot of dead bodies,” McHugh answered. ""A lot of dead bodies ... but you just keep going up. You gotta keep moving. But there were a lot of dead bodies.""

The decorated soldier said he was fortunate that his division had ""a lot of veterans"" since he was, as he described himself, a ""rookie scared stiff"" when they stormed Normandy.

201,"CNN panel knocks Trump's Mexico deal, suggest it's a distraction from weak US job numbers",Joseph Wulfsohn,"A CNN panel had a pretty pessimistic view of the U.S.-Mexico deal President Trump announced Friday in hopes of ending the migration crisis.

Late Friday, Trump tweeted that threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexico were being ""indefinitely suspended"" because Mexico had agreed to help slow the flow of migrants heading toward the U.S. border.

CNN'S DON LEMON LAMENTS TRUMP-ERA 'TOXICITY' AND TROLLS, SAYS HE MAY MOVE ON: REPORTS

But some folks on the liberal news network were not impressed.

Former Republican U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent called the negotiations ""bluster"" and insisted that Trump never would have gone through with his tariff threat because it would have hurt border states like Texas, where he noted that Democrat Joe Biden was leading Trump in a new poll on the 2020 presidential race.

CNN global affairs analyst Susan Glasser also panned the Trump deal.

""We're all sort of props in this fake game of, you know, 'Let's Stick Up The Neighbors',"" she said. ""To me, it's such a predictable play here because we've seen President Trump run it so many times before.

""At the beginning of the week,"" she added, ""how many people in Washington thought this is exactly where we would be on Friday night?""

""I think everybody did,"" CNN anchor Don Lemon responded.

Glasser went on to say Trump ""failed completely"" to control the border and slammed the ""lack of normal policy process"" leading up to the deal, calling the whole thing ""theater.""

CNN contributor and former Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio insisted this was no ""art of the deal.""

""He created this drama on Monday or Tuesday,"" D'Antonio said, ""and I swear they must have locked up the Mexican delegation in the State Department to keep them there for nine or ten hours and then fed them well and they all had a laugh and they let them out and they said, 'Well, the problem is solved.'

""Well, there was no problem the beginning of the week to solve that was extraordinary,"" he added, ""and now we just have this solution that nobody understands and that won't produce what the president actually promised, which was a big, beautiful wall that Mexico would pay for.""

""Is this all about reelection?"" Lemon asked.

""Of course it is,"" D'Antonio answered.

Lemon then invoked the nation's job numbers for May, which fell below expectations, and questioned if Trump's deal had anything to do with the weak stats.

""Do you think that may have weighed in on the president's decision to make a deal, maybe any deal here?"" Lemon asked the Never-Trump Republican.

203,Joe Biden caved to ‘exceedingly radical’ Dems on Hyde Amendment: Matt Schlapp,Brie Stimson,"Joe Biden's reversal this week on the Hyde Amendment regarding abortion funding was a surrender to the “exceedingly radical” wing of the Democratic Party, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp argued Friday on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

Biden said Thursday he could “no longer support"" the amendment, which he had backed as recently as Wednesday, saying it makes a woman's right to an abortion ""dependent on someone's ZIP code.”

“The saddest thing of all,” Schlapp told ""Hannity"" guest host Dan Bongino, ""is to watch him stumble through that statement. Clearly, he doesn’t know what to say or what to do.”

BIDEN ADVISER SYMONE SANDERS LASHES OUT AT MEDIA OVER HYDE AMENDMENT COVERAGE

Schlapp added that abortion “is not health care” and said the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationally, doesn’t mean taxpayers should have to pay for abortion services.

Biden, a Roman Catholic, had long supported the Hyde Amendment and has said he personally opposes abortion. So his reversal this week smacked of political expediency, Schlapp argued.

“This is an open-borders, Green New Deal, socialist Democratic Party that believes in post-birth abortion, late-term abortion,” Schlapp said. “They are exceedingly radical and Joe Biden is trying to go along to get that brass ring.”

“This is an open-borders, Green New Deal, socialist Democratic Party that believes in post-birth abortion, late-term abortion. They are exceedingly radical and Joe Biden is trying to go along to get that brass ring.” — Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union

Another ""Hannity"" guest, Trump 2020 campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, agreed with Schlapp.

“Joe Biden is Puppet Boy,” McEnany said. “There is someone pulling his strings. It’s pathetic. He has no convictions, no principles, no message.”

She said actress Alyssa Milano -- who tried to prevent passage of Georgia's pro-life law -- and low-level Biden staffers appeared to have steered the former vice president away from “whatever principles he had left.”

“This is quite a modest thing to be for,” Schlapp added. “They have become radicalized. This is not your grandfather’s Democratic Party.”

205,Joe Biden caved to ‘exceedingly radical’ Dems on Hyde Amendment: Matt Schlapp,American Conservative Union,"Joe Biden's reversal this week on the Hyde Amendment regarding abortion funding was a surrender to the “exceedingly radical” wing of the Democratic Party, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp argued Friday on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

Biden said Thursday he could “no longer support"" the amendment, which he had backed as recently as Wednesday, saying it makes a woman's right to an abortion ""dependent on someone's ZIP code.”

“The saddest thing of all,” Schlapp told ""Hannity"" guest host Dan Bongino, ""is to watch him stumble through that statement. Clearly, he doesn’t know what to say or what to do.”

Schlapp added that abortion “is not health care” and said the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationally, doesn’t mean taxpayers should have to pay for abortion services.

Biden, a Roman Catholic, had long supported the Hyde Amendment and has said he personally opposes abortion. So his reversal this week smacked of political expediency, Schlapp argued.

“This is an open-borders, Green New Deal, socialist Democratic Party that believes in post-birth abortion, late-term abortion,” Schlapp said. “They are exceedingly radical and Joe Biden is trying to go along to get that brass ring.”

Another ""Hannity"" guest, Trump 2020 campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, agreed with Schlapp.

“Joe Biden is Puppet Boy,” McEnany said. “There is someone pulling his strings. It’s pathetic. He has no convictions, no principles, no message.”

She said actress Alyssa Milano -- who tried to prevent passage of Georgia's pro-life law -- and low-level Biden staffers appeared to have steered the former vice president away from “whatever principles he had left.”

“This is quite a modest thing to be for,” Schlapp added. “They have become radicalized. This is not your grandfather’s Democratic Party.”

206,Maher warns Dems not to make gun control a 2020 issue: 'Liberals should learn more about guns',Joseph Wulfsohn,"""Real Time"" host Bill Maher cautioned Democrats not to make gun control a prominent issue in the 2020 election, urging them not to ""die on this hill"" if it means losing to President Trump.

During his panel discussion Friday night, Maher listed several issues on which Democrats' stands poll better than Republicans,' such as the environment, education and health care. But he noted that Republicans hold a narrow lead over Democrats on gun policy.

Maher then mentioned President Trump's recent sit-down with British TV personality Pierce Morgan, where the president mentioned that some people own guns for recreational use.

Maher added he had doubts whether solutions proposed by Democrats ""would solve the gun problem,"" and that ""to die on this hill and lose an election"" was a real possibility because ""we've lost elections before on this issue, which is not a winning issue for Democrats.""

""What is the option though, not to make it a central part of the campaign?,"" New York Times columnist Charles Blow asked.

""No,"" Maher responded. ""First of all, liberals should learn more about guns. I don't know much about guns because, again, I don't care, I don't like them, but I hear this from gun people.""

The HBO star then mentioned a CNN interview in which 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, was pressed how his gun control plan would have prevented the recent mass shooting in Virginia Beach.

Blow dismissed Maher's criticism, saying the ""framing of the question is wrong"" and pointed to the 30,000 deaths per year that involve guns that needs preventing.

""You're seriously saying that he shouldn't be able to answer the question as a politician, 'How will your plan specifically stop this problem?'"" Maher reacted. ""If you did everything that the Democrats wanted... I still think you would have this problem because it's much more complicated than just the mass killers or the type of gun.

Former Obama White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee made the comments Friday in an appearance on ""Hannity.""

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” she said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting.

""I have somewhat of a problem with that, and I'm glad that wasn't a public statement,"" Goolsbee said. ""I wasn't there. I can't verify she said that. If she did say that, I think that's over the line.""

However, Goolsbee added he believed Trump also committed a similar mistake multiple times during his presidency.

""It's a line that the president of the United States, to be fair, is quite familiar with stepping over, too. Calling for people to be investigated for treason, pronouncing them guilty before there is any investigation,"" he said.

212,Jason Chaffetz: Nadler 'running a clown show with buckets of chicken and convicted felons',Charles Creitz,"House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler has been ""running a clown show"" in his proceedings surrounding the Russia investigation, according to Jason Chaffetz.

Chaffetz reacted Friday on ""The Story"" to news Rep. Nadler's, D-N.Y., committee will convene a hearing with former Nixon White House counsel John Dean on Monday.

Nadler said in a statement he learned much from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, adding Congress must continue where the former FBI director left off.

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO HOLD MUELLER REPORT HEARING WITH WATERGATE FIGURE JOHN DEAN

""We have learned so much even from the redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report,"" Nadler said earlier this week. ""Russia attacked our elections to help President Trump win, Trump and his campaign welcomed this help and the President then tried to obstruct the investigation into the attack. Mueller confirmed these revelations and has now left Congress to pick up where he left off.""

Dean, a onetime member of former President Richard Nixon's staff, later testified against the Republican before the Senate Watergate Committee. Dean later served four months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal.

Chaffetz, a Fox News contributor and former member of the House Judiciary Committee, said there is not much to be gained from Dean's scheduled testimony.

""This is a made-for-C-SPAN event,"" the former Utah congressman claimed. ""The House seems to be bringing convicted felons before it to somehow give testimony that is going to be compelling. [Dean] can shed no light on the immediate situation, no light on what happened during this event.""

213,"Where do 2020 Democrats stand on the Green New Deal, climate change?",Julia Musto,"Since the February release of controversial Democratic Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., Green New Deal, many 2020 presidential candidates have released their own proposals to tackle the issue of climate change.

The original Green New Deal has been supported by many candidates, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas. It has been hailed by the left as a framework for dramatically cutting the United States’ dependence on fossil fuels -- amid a recent report warning of the economic costs climate change would cause in coming years.

WHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES

But conservatives have slammed the Green New Deal itself, which could cost as much as $93 trillion, or approximately $600,000 per household, according to a new study co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as an unworkable and enormously expensive scheme.

GREEN NEW DEAL ARCHITECT SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN LEAD TO '25 HOLOCAUSTS'

Which begs the question -- just where do those Democrats with dreams of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue stand on the issue? Do they support the controversial Green New Deal, and what are their own climate platforms?

Here’s what some have come up with so far…

The 22-page outline released by former Vice President Biden proposes reaching net-zero carbon emissions and achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2050. It calls for an investment of $1.7 trillion of federal funds over the next 10 years, plus private-sector and state and local investments adding up to more than $5 trillion dollars. The money would be paid partially by undoing President Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden’s plan refers to Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, after facing criticism from Democratic presidential rivals about his commitment to environmental protection. Biden has repeatedly insisted his stance is not moderate. In a statement, he pledged to “not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change,” but to “go much further.”

Former President Barack Obama had pledged the U.S. would lower its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

Biden would design “environmental justice” programs to help the poor and minorities who would face disproportionate economic harm from pollution. Biden also promised to provide retraining and new economic opportunities for coal, oil, gas, and other industrial workers displaced by the decline of the fossil fuel industry.

His most aggressive initiative in the plan is the call to compel other countries—particularly China—to reduce emissions. Biden would aim to combine climate change policy with trade policy using the imposition of “carbon tariffs” on goods imported from heavily polluting economies.

Hours after the rollout, many noted the similarities between Biden’s plan and the plans of other candidates. Republicans reacted by accusing Biden of the same offense that hampered his presidential campaign in 1988. Tweeting from a state visit to the UK, the president weighed in: “Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies, not people, to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up, I mean nobody. You can’t win without people!”

The campaign, which had no response when asked by Fox News about the Trump tweet, said earlier on Tuesday that it was a mistake: ""Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren

On Tuesday, Warren unveiled a plan to tackle climate change she dubbed the “Green Manufacturing Deal.”

Her plan would pump $2 trillion into green jobs and technology innovations in the United States. It would also eliminate the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies.

Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. She would also roll back some provisions of the GOP’s 2017 tax law.

The plan is part of a new series of policies Warren will continue to roll out that focus on investing in American jobs and innovation.

The plan is also meant to emphasize Warren's support for reaching the goals of the Green New Deal. Warren released a plan earlier this month on protecting public lands, which would roll back many of the president’s environmental policies, halt offshore drilling, and restore the original boundary lines for two national monuments.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg supports the Green New Deal as well, but has not released his own plan. In May Buttigieg told “Fox News Sunday’s” Chris Wallace, ""What the Green New Deal gets right, is it recognizes that there's also an economic opportunity. Retrofitting buildings means a huge amount of jobs for the building trades in this country.” If the U.S. cannot go carbon-free by 2030, he says he supports going net carbon-free. During a town hall on MSNBC on Monday, Buttigieg told Chris Matthews and an inquisitive eighth grader he would call for a carbon tax, building retrofits, better soil management, and a quadrupling of federal funding for energy and research development.

Last month, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee released a plan hailed by Ocasio-Cortez as the “gold standard.” It would meet, and even exceed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change targets for carbon reduction.

The “Evergreen Economy Plan” begins on day one of his administration. By 2030, it aims to reach 100 percent zero emissions from new vehicles, zero carbon pollution from all new commercial and residential buildings and would require total carbon-neutral power across the country.

By 2035, it proposes completely clean, renewable and zero-emission energy nationwide.

In his 38-page proposal, Inslee seeks to accomplish his plan’s goal through tax incentives for using clean technologies, direct government construction, federal funding of private efforts, regulatory mandates, and use of public land and cooperation with private companies.

Additionally, the plan adds more initiatives like green infrastructure and gradual de-carbonization of existing buildings. Inslee promised to raise the minimum wage and protect collective bargaining power for unions, ensure a ""just transition"" and jobs for workers in the fossil fuel industry, and mandate employers follow guidelines for gender pay parity.

Calling for a $9 trillion investment in green jobs over 10 years, Inslee said his plan would create eight million well-paying jobs for Americans in the transition.

""These folks who have worked in the coal industry are deserving of incredible respect and dignity,"" Inslee told ABC News.

""They are people whose contributions of multiple generations have literally built the economy of the United States, people who are doing really hard work, and are deserving of our respect and what we've done in the state of Washington, which is to make sure that as we go through this transition, that we also make sure we are caring for and embracing these communities to make sure they have a future as well,” he said.

O’Rourke announced his own four-pillar plan to combat climate change just days before Governor Inslee.

The Texan’s plan labels climate change “the greatest threat we face.” He plans to invest $5 trillion over 10 years in infrastructure and innovation and set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

His emission reduction goal is also in line with the Green New Deal. According to the proposal, O’Rourke’s mobilization would be “directly leveraged by a fully paid-for $1.5 trillion investment” and the bill he would introduce to Congress would be funded by ""changes to the tax code to ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies.”

O’Rourke also plans to re-enter the Paris agreement on his first day in office and would ""set a first-ever, net-zero emissions by 2030 carbon budget for federal lands, stopping new fossil fuel leases, changing royalties to reflect climate costs, and accelerating renewables development and forestation.”

Sen. Booker has released the specifics of what he calls his “environment justice plan.” Booker says the proposal would take ""immediate steps"" to strengthen the power of the Environmental Protection Agency. During a campaign stop in Columbia, South Carolina, Booker told his crowd: ""Right now, under this president, the number of actions that are being taken against polluters has gone dramatically down.”","Since the February release of controversial Democratic Socialist Rep.

214,"Where do 2020 Democrats stand on the Green New Deal, climate change?",Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S,"Since the February release of controversial Democratic Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., Green New Deal, many 2020 presidential candidates have released their own proposals to tackle the issue of climate change.

The original Green New Deal has been supported by many candidates, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas. It has been hailed by the left as a framework for dramatically cutting the United States’ dependence on fossil fuels -- amid a recent report warning of the economic costs climate change would cause in coming years.

WHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES

But conservatives have slammed the Green New Deal itself, which could cost as much as $93 trillion, or approximately $600,000 per household, according to a new study co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as an unworkable and enormously expensive scheme.

GREEN NEW DEAL ARCHITECT SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN LEAD TO '25 HOLOCAUSTS'

Which begs the question -- just where do those Democrats with dreams of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue stand on the issue? Do they support the controversial Green New Deal, and what are their own climate platforms?

Here’s what some have come up with so far…

The 22-page outline released by former Vice President Biden proposes reaching net-zero carbon emissions and achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2050. It calls for an investment of $1.7 trillion of federal funds over the next 10 years, plus private-sector and state and local investments adding up to more than $5 trillion dollars. The money would be paid partially by undoing President Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden’s plan refers to Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, after facing criticism from Democratic presidential rivals about his commitment to environmental protection. Biden has repeatedly insisted his stance is not moderate. In a statement, he pledged to “not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change,” but to “go much further.”

Former President Barack Obama had pledged the U.S. would lower its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

Biden would design “environmental justice” programs to help the poor and minorities who would face disproportionate economic harm from pollution. Biden also promised to provide retraining and new economic opportunities for coal, oil, gas, and other industrial workers displaced by the decline of the fossil fuel industry.

His most aggressive initiative in the plan is the call to compel other countries—particularly China—to reduce emissions. Biden would aim to combine climate change policy with trade policy using the imposition of “carbon tariffs” on goods imported from heavily polluting economies.

Hours after the rollout, many noted the similarities between Biden’s plan and the plans of other candidates. Republicans reacted by accusing Biden of the same offense that hampered his presidential campaign in 1988. Tweeting from a state visit to the UK, the president weighed in: “Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies, not people, to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up, I mean nobody. You can’t win without people!”

The campaign, which had no response when asked by Fox News about the Trump tweet, said earlier on Tuesday that it was a mistake: ""Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren

On Tuesday, Warren unveiled a plan to tackle climate change she dubbed the “Green Manufacturing Deal.”

Her plan would pump $2 trillion into green jobs and technology innovations in the United States. It would also eliminate the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies.

Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. She would also roll back some provisions of the GOP’s 2017 tax law.

The plan is part of a new series of policies Warren will continue to roll out that focus on investing in American jobs and innovation.

The plan is also meant to emphasize Warren's support for reaching the goals of the Green New Deal. Warren released a plan earlier this month on protecting public lands, which would roll back many of the president’s environmental policies, halt offshore drilling, and restore the original boundary lines for two national monuments.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg supports the Green New Deal as well, but has not released his own plan. In May Buttigieg told “Fox News Sunday’s” Chris Wallace, ""What the Green New Deal gets right, is it recognizes that there's also an economic opportunity. Retrofitting buildings means a huge amount of jobs for the building trades in this country.” If the U.S. cannot go carbon-free by 2030, he says he supports going net carbon-free. During a town hall on MSNBC on Monday, Buttigieg told Chris Matthews and an inquisitive eighth grader he would call for a carbon tax, building retrofits, better soil management, and a quadrupling of federal funding for energy and research development.

Last month, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee released a plan hailed by Ocasio-Cortez as the “gold standard.” It would meet, and even exceed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change targets for carbon reduction.

The “Evergreen Economy Plan” begins on day one of his administration. By 2030, it aims to reach 100 percent zero emissions from new vehicles, zero carbon pollution from all new commercial and residential buildings and would require total carbon-neutral power across the country.

By 2035, it proposes completely clean, renewable and zero-emission energy nationwide.

In his 38-page proposal, Inslee seeks to accomplish his plan’s goal through tax incentives for using clean technologies, direct government construction, federal funding of private efforts, regulatory mandates, and use of public land and cooperation with private companies.

Additionally, the plan adds more initiatives like green infrastructure and gradual de-carbonization of existing buildings. Inslee promised to raise the minimum wage and protect collective bargaining power for unions, ensure a ""just transition"" and jobs for workers in the fossil fuel industry, and mandate employers follow guidelines for gender pay parity.

Calling for a $9 trillion investment in green jobs over 10 years, Inslee said his plan would create eight million well-paying jobs for Americans in the transition.

""These folks who have worked in the coal industry are deserving of incredible respect and dignity,"" Inslee told ABC News.

""They are people whose contributions of multiple generations have literally built the economy of the United States, people who are doing really hard work, and are deserving of our respect and what we've done in the state of Washington, which is to make sure that as we go through this transition, that we also make sure we are caring for and embracing these communities to make sure they have a future as well,” he said.

O’Rourke announced his own four-pillar plan to combat climate change just days before Governor Inslee.

The Texan’s plan labels climate change “the greatest threat we face.” He plans to invest $5 trillion over 10 years in infrastructure and innovation and set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

His emission reduction goal is also in line with the Green New Deal. According to the proposal, O’Rourke’s mobilization would be “directly leveraged by a fully paid-for $1.5 trillion investment” and the bill he would introduce to Congress would be funded by ""changes to the tax code to ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies.”

O’Rourke also plans to re-enter the Paris agreement on his first day in office and would ""set a first-ever, net-zero emissions by 2030 carbon budget for federal lands, stopping new fossil fuel leases, changing royalties to reflect climate costs, and accelerating renewables development and forestation.”

217,Ben Shapiro: Trump's Normandy media coverage 'preset' to deny president 'full victory',Charles Creitz,"President Trump was rightfully praised for his D-Day speech, but the press coverage was still ""preset"" to disallow him ""full victory,"" according to Ben Shapiro.

Shapiro, editor of the Daily Wire, claimed the mainstream media concentrated on ""ancillary issues"" instead of what was truly happening at the commemoration in Normandy, in an appearance Friday on ""The Story.""

""I think he gave one of the great speeches of his presidency, and yet most of the media coverage surrounded ancillary issues that had pretty much nothing to do with what was happening on the ground,"" Shapiro said.

DETROIT POLICE SEARCH 1,000 ABANDONED HOMES FOR POSSIBLE SERIAL KILLER VICTIMS AFTER THREE SEX WORKERS FOUND DEAD

Authorities first alerted the public to a possible “serial killer and rapist” in the area on Wednesday after a third woman was discovered dead in an abandoned home on the east side of Detroit.

The victim had not been identified as of Friday pending family notification but she was described as a 55-year-old female whose death matched a similar pattern to two other victims. Her body was found three to four days after her death, Craig said.

The first body was discovered on March 19 on the east side of Detroit in a “vacant dwelling.” The victim, later identified as Nancy Harrison, 52, was found “partially clad.”

POLICE ID THREE BODIES FOUND INSIDE BARRELS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE PARK NEARLY TWO DECADES LATER

Investigators initially believed she died of a drug overdose but on May 20, the medical examiner’s autopsy report revealed that cause of death was “blunt force trauma.”

Several days later on May 24 a second woman, Trevesene Ellis, 53, was found dead not far from the first victim. She too was found “partially clad” in an abandoned home.

The suspect showed no identification and rejected the mother’s demand to ride along with her baby, saying there wasn’t room in the car.

At that point, the suspect allegedly said she’d return with sheriff’s deputies and have the newborn forcibly removed, KABC-TV reported.

""And I say, 'OK, if the sheriff has to come in, that's fine. But I don't want to give you my kid,"" the mother told KABC.

She recorded video of the suspect and her vehicle on her cellphone as the woman left the home and by the evening the suspect had turned herself in to police custody, FOX 11 reported.

The suspect, whom Social Services confirmed was not in their employ, admitted she was at the house but claimed she was not there to kidnap the baby.

She will now be interviewed by homicide detectives, according to KABC.

""How did this woman know that this victim had a child less than two weeks ago, where she lives?,"" asked Santa Ana Police Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. ""How'd she get her personal information? That's all scary to us.""

It is unclear if the suspect has been charged with a crime.

222,Trade union holds up Silicon Valley residential project over potential threat to birds,Lukas Mikelionis,"A California trade union is seeking to block a major residential construction project in the heart of housing-starved Silicon Valley, claiming there will be a bloodbath of birds due to the proposed building's reflective windows.

The Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA), which represents construction workers in Sunnyvale -- a city of about 140,000 residents between Stanford University and downtown San Jose -- has sued the city and its council over the project.

SOME SAN FRANCISCANS NOW LIVING ON THE BAY AS HOUSING CRUNCH SENDS THEM TO BOATS, BARGES

The union claims that the approved 1,051-unit residential project, sponsored by the Irvine Company, may cause permanent damage to the environment and thus must be scrapped, Reason magazine reported.

The project would tear down office buildings in an industrial area and instead build apartments and townhouses, providing desperately needed affordable housing in the area. More than half the units would also be rented at below-market prices to people on lower incomes.

But the union’s lawsuit says that unless additional environmental review is conducted, the project will cause damage to residents and wildlife. The lawsuit notes that birds will be killed as the proposed project features reflective windows.

SAN FRANCISCO TO FORCE TREATMENT FOR MENTALLY ILL DRUG ADDICTS AMID CRITICISM PLAN VIOLATES CIVIL RIGHTS

According to the outlet, the trade union is using the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law mandating government agencies to study potential environmental impacts, to disrupt the project. Rather than protecting the environment, the decades-old law has been used by interested groups in the past to ensure unwanted projects don’t get off the ground.

The trade union’s chapter in Los Angeles is even accused of precisely that – filing frivolous CEQA complaints to a building project to ensure the company in charge of it hires all-union labor. The developer, Icon, says the union’s actions violate federal racketeering laws, according to the outlet.

The Sunnyvale union says that more than 500 birds would die by flying into the project's reflective windows, while the residents’ cats could also increase this number even further, causing serious environmental damage.

“Following a team from a long distance is a pretty specific experience. So getting to see this all in person, in the finals, is slightly strange and very fun,” he said.

Toronto’s stars must’ve known he was in attendance, as the Raptors dominated the Warriors in the second half to take a 105-92 win.

230,Ali Noorani: America needs immigrants – they are vital to our success and prosperity,Ali Noorani,"President Trump would like us to believe that immigrants are a burden on our country, costing us billions of dollars a year to support and absorb, and harming us with drug smuggling and other crimes. But in fact, the jobs report released by the U.S. Labor Department Friday tells us a different story – and explains why America needs immigrants.

“Our country is FULL!” the president tweeted April 7, saying the “Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States.”

President Trump even threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican products coming to the U.S. starting Monday if that nation did not take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorized immigrants.

US MAKES DEAL WITH MEXICO ON TARIFFS, IMMIGRATION, TRUMP ANNOUNCES

But the president announced via Twitter Friday night that the tariffs were “indefinitely suspended” because the U.S. and Mexico had signed an agreement under which “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to….stem the Tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, illegal immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”

Yet despite the president’s focus on keeping immigrants out, what has been true throughout our nation’s history remains true today: immigrants are the key to America’s economic growth, success and prosperity. And immigrants are vital if we are to maintain continued American leadership in a broad range of businesses and innovation.

The initial takeaway from the May jobs report that came out Friday is that America’s mighty economic engine continues humming along, showing the 104th straight month with an increase in jobs.

With the national unemployment rate now just 3.6 percent, we are looking at the real possibility that in a few months the current economic expansion could become the longest on record, surpassing the stretch from March 1991 to March 2001.

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

OK, so what does this have to do with the need for new immigrants?

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

Decreasing fertility, an aging population, and labor shortages endanger America’s long-term economic vitality. To address the structural challenges that will bedevil American competitiveness, we need a prudent immigration policy for the 21st century.

In the past, we could rely on birth rates to power growth, but according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, the general fertility rate in the U.S. was down 2 percent from 2017 to 2018.

That may not sound like a big drop, but it is. The total fertility rate was the lowest on record and below the rate at which a population replaces itself over time.

To make matters worse, the population isn’t just stagnating, it’s aging. Baby boomers – the single largest population cohort in history – are rapidly becoming booming elders. In just a decade, older Americans are set to outnumber children for the first time in history.

This is not a sustainable trajectory for the U.S. economy.

What has long separated the U.S. from nearly every other economy in the world is immigration. Last year immigration accounted for nearly half of population growth in the U.S.

And while the Trump administration pushes hardline immigration policies and questions the merits of immigration writ large, in many parts of the country economic growth is outpacing growth in the labor force, producing serious labor shortages.

America has 1 million more job openings than we do unemployed workers. We’ve had fewer than one unemployed person per available job for at least a year.

It’s a phenomenon that is not striking all parts of the nation equally.

Our cities and their nearby suburbs are continuing to exert a magnetic force on our population, drawing people away from small towns and rural areas that are serving as canaries in the coal mine for this demographic crisis.

For example, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 30 undocumented immigrants last year, businesses are struggling to fill 300 open positions.

About six hours to the east, researchers at Ball State University in Indiana released a report showing that since 2000, a full quarter of that state’s population growth came from immigrants.

But things could have been worse. From 1990-2016, 17 counties in Indiana saw a loss of population even though they saw an increase in their immigrant population. Population losses would have been an even bigger problem without immigration.

What’s lost in our current immigration debate is an important fact: Immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers. Studies clearly demonstrate that the economy is not a Darwinian zero-sum game.

U.S.-born workers typically take jobs that require higher levels of education and skills and pay higher wages, while immigrants tend to fill jobs that require lower skill levels.

Immigrants are also more likely than native-born Americans to launch a business. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were created by immigrants or their children.

Immigrant families matter as well. First and foremost, they provide comfort and well-being for newcomers. They also provide social networks that enable immigrants to find jobs and child care, integrate into society, and even receive loans to launch a company. We can’t have a functioning immigration system and a thriving society without valuing family.

Between now and 2035, all growth in the U.S. workforce will come from immigrants and their children. That means that without continuing immigration, our economy would be in big trouble.

It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground around immigration reforms that ensure our workforce grows with our economic and social needs.

This requires rebuilding our legal immigration system to provide a stable, reliable workforce – from the skilled farmworker to the skilled engineer.

If we are to act in our national self-interest, that means that no one who graduates from an American university with a degree in science technology, engineering or math should be kicked out of the country and sent to a competitor nation. We need them here.

And no American business trying to hire construction workers should shutter because government policy makes it too hard to hire newcomers.

Sensible immigration reform also needs to recognize the critical importance of immigrants working legally but not permanently. This includes young immigrants brought to the U.S. without authorization who are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, as well as those with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure visas.

And sensible immigration reform needs to create an opportunity for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization to meet certain conditions – including but not limited to passing background checks and learning English – and then start the process of becoming full-fledged, fully contributing Americans.

Above all, immigration reform should send an unambiguous message: The U.S. remains open to those who want to contribute and provide the dynamism that has powered our growth since the country’s founding.

While Friday’s positive jobs figures evince the current strength of our economy, our prospects moving forward will depend on whether we remain a nation of immigrants.

The bottom line is that admitting immigrants to the United States and creating a path to citizenship for them is not simply an act of compassion or charity. In addition to being the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. It will benefit our country and our entire population far into the future, just as immigrants and their descendants have done throughout our history.

America has 1 million more job openings than we do unemployed workers. We’ve had fewer than one unemployed person per available job for at least a year.

It’s a phenomenon that is not striking all parts of the nation equally.

Our cities and their nearby suburbs are continuing to exert a magnetic force on our population, drawing people away from small towns and rural areas that are serving as canaries in the coal mine for this demographic crisis.

For example, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 30 undocumented immigrants last year, businesses are struggling to fill 300 open positions.

About six hours to the east, researchers at Ball State University in Indiana released a report showing that since 2000, a full quarter of that state’s population growth came from immigrants.

But things could have been worse. From 1990-2016, 17 counties in Indiana saw a loss of population even though they saw an increase in their immigrant population. Population losses would have been an even bigger problem without immigration.

What’s lost in our current immigration debate is an important fact: Immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers. Studies clearly demonstrate that the economy is not a Darwinian zero-sum game.

U.S.-born workers typically take jobs that require higher levels of education and skills and pay higher wages, while immigrants tend to fill jobs that require lower skill levels.

Immigrants are also more likely than native-born Americans to launch a business. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were created by immigrants or their children.

Immigrant families matter as well. First and foremost, they provide comfort and well-being for newcomers. They also provide social networks that enable immigrants to find jobs and child care, integrate into society, and even receive loans to launch a company. We can’t have a functioning immigration system and a thriving society without valuing family.

Between now and 2035, all growth in the U.S. workforce will come from immigrants and their children. That means that without continuing immigration, our economy would be in big trouble.

It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground around immigration reforms that ensure our workforce grows with our economic and social needs.

This requires rebuilding our legal immigration system to provide a stable, reliable workforce – from the skilled farmworker to the skilled engineer.

If we are to act in our national self-interest, that means that no one who graduates from an American university with a degree in science technology, engineering or math should be kicked out of the country and sent to a competitor nation. We need them here.

And no American business trying to hire construction workers should shutter because government policy makes it too hard to hire newcomers.

Sensible immigration reform also needs to recognize the critical importance of immigrants working legally but not permanently. This includes young immigrants brought to the U.S. without authorization who are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, as well as those with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure visas.

And sensible immigration reform needs to create an opportunity for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization to meet certain conditions – including but not limited to passing background checks and learning English – and then start the process of becoming full-fledged, fully contributing Americans.

Above all, immigration reform should send an unambiguous message: The U.S. remains open to those who want to contribute and provide the dynamism that has powered our growth since the country’s founding.

While Friday’s positive jobs figures evince the current strength of our economy, our prospects moving forward will depend on whether we remain a nation of immigrants.

The bottom line is that admitting immigrants to the United States and creating a path to citizenship for them is not simply an act of compassion or charity. In addition to being the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. It will benefit our country and our entire population far into the future, just as immigrants and their descendants have done throughout our history.

232,Ali Noorani: America needs immigrants – they are vital to our success and prosperity,Author Of,"President Trump would like us to believe that immigrants are a burden on our country, costing us billions of dollars a year to support and absorb, and harming us with drug smuggling and other crimes. But in fact, the jobs report released by the U.S. Labor Department Friday tells us a different story – and explains why America needs immigrants.

“Our country is FULL!” the president tweeted April 7, saying the “Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States.”

President Trump even threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican products coming to the U.S. starting Monday if that nation did not take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorized immigrants.

US MAKES DEAL WITH MEXICO ON TARIFFS, IMMIGRATION, TRUMP ANNOUNCES

But the president announced via Twitter Friday night that the tariffs were “indefinitely suspended” because the U.S. and Mexico had signed an agreement under which “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to….stem the Tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, illegal immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”

Yet despite the president’s focus on keeping immigrants out, what has been true throughout our nation’s history remains true today: immigrants are the key to America’s economic growth, success and prosperity. And immigrants are vital if we are to maintain continued American leadership in a broad range of businesses and innovation.

The initial takeaway from the May jobs report that came out Friday is that America’s mighty economic engine continues humming along, showing the 104th straight month with an increase in jobs.

With the national unemployment rate now just 3.6 percent, we are looking at the real possibility that in a few months the current economic expansion could become the longest on record, surpassing the stretch from March 1991 to March 2001.

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

OK, so what does this have to do with the need for new immigrants?

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

Decreasing fertility, an aging population, and labor shortages endanger America’s long-term economic vitality. To address the structural challenges that will bedevil American competitiveness, we need a prudent immigration policy for the 21st century.

In the past, we could rely on birth rates to power growth, but according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, the general fertility rate in the U.S. was down 2 percent from 2017 to 2018.

That may not sound like a big drop, but it is. The total fertility rate was the lowest on record and below the rate at which a population replaces itself over time.

To make matters worse, the population isn’t just stagnating, it’s aging. Baby boomers – the single largest population cohort in history – are rapidly becoming booming elders. In just a decade, older Americans are set to outnumber children for the first time in history.

This is not a sustainable trajectory for the U.S. economy.

Between now and 2035, all growth in the U.S. workforce will come from immigrants and their children. That means that without continuing immigration, our economy would be in big trouble.

It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground around immigration reforms that ensure our workforce grows with our economic and social needs.

This requires rebuilding our legal immigration system to provide a stable, reliable workforce – from the skilled farmworker to the skilled engineer.

If we are to act in our national self-interest, that means that no one who graduates from an American university with a degree in science technology, engineering or math should be kicked out of the country and sent to a competitor nation. We need them here.

And no American business trying to hire construction workers should shutter because government policy makes it too hard to hire newcomers.

Sensible immigration reform also needs to recognize the critical importance of immigrants working legally but not permanently. This includes young immigrants brought to the U.S. without authorization who are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, as well as those with Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure visas.

And sensible immigration reform needs to create an opportunity for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization to meet certain conditions – including but not limited to passing background checks and learning English – and then start the process of becoming full-fledged, fully contributing Americans.

Above all, immigration reform should send an unambiguous message: The U.S. remains open to those who want to contribute and provide the dynamism that has powered our growth since the country’s founding.

While Friday’s positive jobs figures evince the current strength of our economy, our prospects moving forward will depend on whether we remain a nation of immigrants.

The bottom line is that admitting immigrants to the United States and creating a path to citizenship for them is not simply an act of compassion or charity. In addition to being the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. It will benefit our country and our entire population far into the future, just as immigrants and their descendants have done throughout our history.

236,Ali Noorani: America needs immigrants – they are vital to our success and prosperity,He Can Be Found On Twitter At,"President Trump would like us to believe that immigrants are a burden on our country, costing us billions of dollars a year to support and absorb, and harming us with drug smuggling and other crimes. But in fact, the jobs report released by the U.S. Labor Department Friday tells us a different story – and explains why America needs immigrants.

“Our country is FULL!” the president tweeted April 7, saying the “Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States.”

President Trump even threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican products coming to the U.S. starting Monday if that nation did not take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorized immigrants.

US MAKES DEAL WITH MEXICO ON TARIFFS, IMMIGRATION, TRUMP ANNOUNCES

But the president announced via Twitter Friday night that the tariffs were “indefinitely suspended” because the U.S. and Mexico had signed an agreement under which “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to….stem the Tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, illegal immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.”

Yet despite the president’s focus on keeping immigrants out, what has been true throughout our nation’s history remains true today: immigrants are the key to America’s economic growth, success and prosperity. And immigrants are vital if we are to maintain continued American leadership in a broad range of businesses and innovation.

The initial takeaway from the May jobs report that came out Friday is that America’s mighty economic engine continues humming along, showing the 104th straight month with an increase in jobs.

With the national unemployment rate now just 3.6 percent, we are looking at the real possibility that in a few months the current economic expansion could become the longest on record, surpassing the stretch from March 1991 to March 2001.

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

OK, so what does this have to do with the need for new immigrants?

The fact is that in the not-to-distant future, America will face a serious demographic challenge. Not too many people – as President Trump would have us believe – but too few.

Decreasing fertility, an aging population, and labor shortages endanger America’s long-term economic vitality. To address the structural challenges that will bedevil American competitiveness, we need a prudent immigration policy for the 21st century.

In the past, we could rely on birth rates to power growth, but according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, the general fertility rate in the U.S. was down 2 percent from 2017 to 2018.

That may not sound like a big drop, but it is. The total fertility rate was the lowest on record and below the rate at which a population replaces itself over time.

To make matters worse, the population isn’t just stagnating, it’s aging. Baby boomers – the single largest population cohort in history – are rapidly becoming booming elders. In just a decade, older Americans are set to outnumber children for the first time in history.

This is not a sustainable trajectory for the U.S. economy.

What has long separated the U.S. from nearly every other economy in the world is immigration. Last year immigration accounted for nearly half of population growth in the U.S.

And while the Trump administration pushes hardline immigration policies and questions the merits of immigration writ large, in many parts of the country economic growth is outpacing growth in the labor force, producing serious labor shortages.

America has 1 million more job openings than we do unemployed workers. We’ve had fewer than one unemployed person per available job for at least a year.

It’s a phenomenon that is not striking all parts of the nation equally.

Our cities and their nearby suburbs are continuing to exert a magnetic force on our population, drawing people away from small towns and rural areas that are serving as canaries in the coal mine for this demographic crisis.

For example, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 30 undocumented immigrants last year, businesses are struggling to fill 300 open positions.

About six hours to the east, researchers at Ball State University in Indiana released a report showing that since 2000, a full quarter of that state’s population growth came from immigrants.

But things could have been worse. From 1990-2016, 17 counties in Indiana saw a loss of population even though they saw an increase in their immigrant population. Population losses would have been an even bigger problem without immigration.

What’s lost in our current immigration debate is an important fact: Immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers. Studies clearly demonstrate that the economy is not a Darwinian zero-sum game.

U.S.-born workers typically take jobs that require higher levels of education and skills and pay higher wages, while immigrants tend to fill jobs that require lower skill levels.

Immigrants are also more likely than native-born Americans to launch a business. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were created by immigrants or their children.

Immigrant families matter as well. First and foremost, they provide comfort and well-being for newcomers. They also provide social networks that enable immigrants to find jobs and child care, integrate into society, and even receive loans to launch a company. We can’t have a functioning immigration system and a thriving society without valuing family.

Between now and 2035, all growth in the U.S. workforce will come from immigrants and their children. That means that without continuing immigration, our economy would be in big trouble.

237,"Laurie Crouch: We really are better together, ladies -- Thank God for female friendships",Laurie Crouch,"Sociologists have devoted many hours and words to detangling the mysteries of female friendships. As a wife, mother, daughter and friend that’s been on this earth for a few decades now and participated in many successful — and maaaybe a few possible failed — friendships, there’s a thing or two I could share to save them some time and energy.

Sometimes we make friendship way more difficult than it needs to be.

We avoid confrontation at all costs.

AMERICAN WOMAN, 21, BECOMES YOUNGEST PERSON TO VISIT EVERY COUNTRY

And yes, we always to go the restroom in pairs because that short trip really is better with a friend in tow.

One thing that always remains are the girlfriends God gives you to help you walk through these seasons. We need each other.

But above all, the one thing about women that I believe more than anything else is this: we’re better together.

We’re better when we listen without an agenda.

We’re better when we support instead of compete with each other.

We’re better when we lock arms and stand up for each other’s children.

We’re better when we do whatever it takes to point each other to Christ.

As one author found, women, though thought to be less competitive than men, really just compete with a different currency: we value the degree to which one is privy to the details of her friends’ lives—which is what makes us so prone to gossip.

But the other side of that coin is that women are relational. We care — deeply. And while there might be an underlying drive tinged with a hint of competition, overall, women tend to love each other well. (And mostly hold close each other’s confidences!)

I am fortunate to be surrounded by a group of women who are committed to being there for each other. We’re all different ages and in different stages of life, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t relate. It does mean, however, that sometimes friendship might look a little different or require a bit more effort for one of us than it does for another. But thankfully, there is much love and grace for each other on our journey.

Here are a few ways these women make me better.

They challenge me. As a follower of Christ, I am called to be in relationship with others. The other women in my close circle are Christians, too, and not only challenge me to be a better Christian by reflecting Christ in our personal relationships, but also by reaching out to those who don’t share our faith. They challenge me to be a better mother, a better servant, and a better friend, oftentimes by doing nothing more than being an excellent model of each of these things.

They support me. These women know what’s going on in my life and are my go-to support system. They send me quick text messages to check in on me. They lend a helping hand when they’re able. They pray for me and let me know when they’re thinking about me. They don’t let me walk through this life alone.

They love me. Love can look like many things. For these women, it looks like forgiving me for my shortcomings. It looks like showing up during a stormy season. It looks like holding my hand while I mourn a loss. It looks like giving me their honest opinion and wise advice. These women are Jesus in the flesh when I need Him most.

They encourage me in the Lord. These women know me and they know my heart, therefore, they also know when I need to be reminded of what the Word says about my situation. Their friendship not only makes me a better friend — it makes me a better follower of Christ.

These women do these things for me, and it’s my joy and privilege to do the same for them. We’re meant to walk through this life in community, sharing in each other’s joy and sorrows. We’re meant to be better together.

And as summertime is upon is, mamas with school-aged children will revel in more quality time with their children. I was one of those that was always so excited for summer to start, anticipating the many adventures awaiting us over those special days.

I think if we could just remember to view these days as fresh opportunities to make lasting memories with our kids, it will help you get through the full and sometimes stressful moments that can come along with all the free time they have! Just soak it all up because in the blink of an eye, they’re grown and getting married and out of your house!

One thing that always remains through these changes are the girlfriends God gives you to help you walk through these seasons. We need each other.

Take a minute to identify the women in your life who make you better. Whether they’re mothers, sisters, daughters, friends, or all of the above, these women have shaped us into who we are today and will help us make it through to tomorrow (judgment free!). Don’t let today go by without thanking your tribe for doing life with you. We’re really better together.","One thing that always remains are the girlfriends God gives you to help you walk through these seasons.

238,Kathy Barnette: I am the product of a rape and my life matters,Kathy Barnette,"It is never an easy decision to be vulnerable. The fear of rejection. The fear of shame. The fear of hurting the ones you love are all real and powerful hurdles to overcome.

Yet I am reminded of a quote from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said: “Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the (judgment) that something else is more important than fear.”

This is my something more. This is my story.

KATHY BARNETTE: HERE'S THE ONE THING I WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW ABOUT THE FOURTH OF JULY

I am the product of a rape. My mother was 12-years old when she delivered me. My father was 21-years old.

I had nothing to do with my genesis. I had nothing to do with the conditions under which I was conceived. I had no control over the circumstances that were swirling around me. I had no opportunity to partake in the cumulative decisions that would be made to sustain the pregnancy. Yet, all the while, I was being fearfully and wonderfully woven together in my young mother’s womb.

My life has value. I am not an inanimate object. I am a person. From me, I’ve given birth to two beautiful, healthy, intelligent, and loving little people who are destined to grow up into productive members of this great society. I am a veteran. I am a staunch lover of this country. I’m a supportive sister, a respectful niece and a devoted wife. Best of all, I get the wonderful opportunity to now care for my mother.

My life has value. I have worth that extended beyond the circumstances of my conception. I have multiple degrees. I’ve traveled the world. I’ve spoken before millions. And, I just landed my first book deal with the No. 1 conservative publisher in the nation.

In many aspects, I’ve lived a charmed life. But, it all started with a decision from my mother.

I am eternally grateful to my mom. She had me.

I am forever grateful to my grandma Hattie, who came alongside both my mother and me to provide a safety net for us. I am grateful to my paternal grandparents, who stepped in and assisted my mother in providing for me.

This story is not just about me, however. The story behind every conception, especially as a result of rape, is not just about the child who survived. This story is about my mother, as well – little Mamie Jo.

My birth certificate lists her as merely a “Negro girl.” That tells us nothing about her. My mother is a survivor. She grew up to become a pillar of strength to me and to everyone who crossed her path.

If my story is able to give a voice, a face and a potential future to an unborn child who had nothing to do with his or her genesis, then sharing my story is worth it.

Life has not been a bed of roses for my mother. She has made her fair share of mistakes along the way. There is a pathology that accompanies such a traumatic event.

Yet, as I stand here today, a full-grown woman with a family of my own, I continue to be immensely impressed with my mother. She believed. And she never gave up. She never stopped smiling. She never stopped striving for something better. She refused to be defeated. She refused to be a victim.

Even now I can feel the weight of my mother’s choices. She chose to survive the rape, to endure harsh treatment, to reject the lingering presence of hopelessness and fear.

My mother refused the shame. She did so not because of her circumstances that must have been unbearable. She did so because of the joy that was set before her. She peered into the future and saw me. I am my mother’s joy. And every one of my mother’s decisions concerning my birth had an impact on my life. An impact that will reverberate for all eternity.

I’m so grateful for the conversations that are being had all across our nation about the morality behind abortions. Is it right? Is it wrong? Is the woman to be the sole decider of my worth … of her unborn child’s worth? This is a tumultuous terrain any family would have to navigate. There is no easy solution.

241,Joshua Rogers: I went on a search for my fifth grade teacher -- here's what happened when I found her,Joshua Rogers,"As I clicked “publish” on my blog post, I had a faint hope that I would find my fifth-grade English teacher, Ms. Saucier. The blog post was titled “If Jesus were a fifth-grade teacher.”

I had lost touch with Ms. Saucier several years before and despite online searches, I had come up with nothing. The blog post was both a tribute and a last-ditch effort to find her.

The blog post didn’t make it to Ms. Saucier — not at first. It did make it to a reader named Amy. Her mom knew someone who knew Ms. Saucier, her name was Sue, and she offered three possible contact numbers. None of them worked. I left my number with Sue and prayed that God would help Ms. Saucier and I reconnect.

I NEVER THOUGHT MY DAUGHTER WOULD LEARN THIS WORD IN KINDERGARTEN

Three weeks later, I got a text from an unfamiliar number. It read, “Hello Josh Rogers. My friend Sue gave me your number, and I am so thrilled to be able to say hello to you. Have thought of you often…please catch me up on your life. Look forward to hearing from you. Love you, Ms. Saucier.”

With my heart racing, I immediately called the number and waited. A woman picked up and answered with that warm, familiar voice I remembered from fifth grade.

“Hi, Ms. Saucier,” I said. “I just wanted to talk so I could say, 'thank you.'""

At different points in your life, Jesus has sent along a “Ms. Saucier” — a person who helped you feel safe and loved. Maybe, like my Ms. Saucier, it was a person whose love brought healing.

She couldn't believe how hard I had worked to find her, but I told her I felt like I had to. I wanted her to know how much she had meant to me.

“My family was going through a lot back then and I was acting out a lot. I think the other teachers saw me as a problem child but you made me feel like you loved me.”

“I really did love you,” she said.

“Remember that time I wrote a short story and handed it in to you even though you didn’t even assign it?” I asked.

She laughed.

“I’ll never forget what you wrote on it after you read it: ‘Great job! I’ll vote for you when you run for President!’ You have no idea how much that meant to me.”

“I said it because I believed it, Joshua. I always knew you were going to do something very special with your life.”

The conversation went on for quite a while, just as naturally as our conversations did when I was a kid. And before we said a teary goodbye, she said, “I hope you know I still fully expect you to be President one day — and I’d better get an invitation to the inauguration.”

Classic Mrs. Saucier.

The other day I was thinking about Ms. Saucier and it brought to mind a story about Jesus and ten lepers – social outcasts of their day. Jesus healed all ten simultaneously, but only one returned to thank Him.

“Didn’t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?” (Luke 17:17).

I can hear the sadness in Jesus’ question, like a disappointed parent whose child shows no gratitude on Christmas morning. But then there’s a warmth you can feel when Jesus turns and says to the one who returned, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well” (Luke 17:19).

The man’s grateful return to Jesus resulted in a double blessing; and today, you can experience a blessing of your own, if you’re willing.

At different points in your life, Jesus has sent along a “Ms. Saucier” — a person who helped you feel safe and loved. Maybe, like my Ms. Saucier, it was a person whose love brought healing.

Don’t be one of the nine lepers who disappears and never returns to offer thanks. Be the person who remembers the gift you’ve received and find the one who gave it. Tell that person what he or she meant to you — tell God what that person meant to you. You may end up being the one who receives the biggest blessing.

242,Bradley Blakeman: Trade pact with Canada and Mexico offers incredible benefits – Congress should approve it,Bradley Blakeman,"Congress should quickly approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the updated and improved version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between our three nations.

Countries that have put tariffs on American products, restricted trade, lied, cheated and stolen from our nation are laughing at our inability to defend ourselves by enacting this fair trade agreement.

Every day that America does not level the trading field we lose jobs, customers and put in peril our present and long-term economic prosperity.

JONAH GOLDBERG: TRUMP MEXICO TARIFF THREAT COULD ‘SCUTTLE’ PLANNED REPLACEMENT OF NAFTA

After years of slow growth and stagnation, the American economy today is robust. Americans are seeing more in their take-home pay. Manufacturing is returning. Jobs that had been moved offshore have come back to America.

To understand just how important trade is with our neighbors to the north and south, you have to appreciate the statistics. Trade with Mexico and Canada supports 12 million U.S. jobs. The Trump administration expects that number will increase to add another 176,000 American jobs when the USMCA is enacted.

Delays in getting needed approval by Congress of the USMCA are further hurting our markets and competition.

Internet industries are stuck with old NAFTA rules that restrict and hamper sales. The USMCA contains modern and up-to-date standards for sales and trade. It also safeguards cross-border data flows and prohibits forced data localization requirements that hamper American competition and control of our data and operations.

Our agricultural sectors are also plagued with antiquated and unfair trade practices and rules under the old NAFTA agreement, which went into effect at the beginning of 1994.

The USMCA will maintain duty-free access for American farmers in Mexico and opens up the Canadian market for the first time to American dairy, wheat, chicken, egg and turkey products.

By approving the USMCA, Congress will enable American farmers and ranchers to expand their operations here and in Canada, and allow them to make investments in personnel, equipment and infrastructure.

The USMCA also will allow for improved health and safety standards that require Mexico and Canada to comply and report on.

The secret to America’s success has been our ability to innovate. The USMCA better protects that by requiring Canada and Mexico to honor our intellectual property and trade secrets.

In addition, the USMCA expedites the patent and approval process in Mexico and Canada, allowing America’s innovative products to be sold in those markets sooner, while protecting them from infringement and theft.

USMCA is the first trade agreement that includes provisions that address the concerns of small and medium-size businesses, which represent 98 percent of our exporters. It also cuts red tape for customs procedures and protocols that have unduly burdened small and medium-size businesses.

America’s greatest asset is our workers. The USMCA includes advanced, comprehensive and enforceable labor obligations that level the playing field and provides opportunity for our workforce.

The agreement also requires Mexico to pass laws overhauling its labor justice system to protect its workers, which in turn creates fairer competition in trade.

On top of this, the agreement will raise the standard of living for American workers by requiring 40 to 45 percent of automobile content to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.

The USMCA will help American manufacturers by maintaining the successful duty-free access of U.S. manufactured goods into Canada and Mexico.

Today, 46 out of 50 states count Mexico and Canada as their first and second-largest foreign purchasers. The USCMA will ensure this trade continues and grows.

U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Canada and Mexico support more than 2 million jobs at 43,000 manufacturing businesses across our country.

Canada and Mexico are the largest purchasers of American manufactured goods – purchasing more than the next 10 U.S. trading partners combined.

America’s premier industry is automobile-related. We need to pass the USMCA to protect it from abuses and unfair trade practices.

The United States Trade Representative estimates that the USMCA will add $34 billion in automotive investment and will create 76,000 new American jobs over 5 years – figures that come from the automobile-related companies themselves.

The USMCA will encourage investment and manufacturing growth in the U.S. by establishing higher content requirements for U.S. components. The agreement also transforms supply chains to use more U.S. content to encourage suppliers to locate future production in the U.S.

Every day that the USMCA goes unsigned, America loses. Friends, adversaries and enemies are looking at the USMCA as a barometer as to how to treat us and what they can get away with.

Now is the time to act. NAFTA is outdated, ineffective and hurtful to our economy and our workers. Letting the USMCA languish is a gross dereliction of duty by Congress.

On top of this, the agreement will raise the standard of living for American workers by requiring 40 to 45 percent of automobile content to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.

The USMCA will help American manufacturers by maintaining the successful duty-free access of U.S. manufactured goods into Canada and Mexico.

Today, 46 out of 50 states count Mexico and Canada as their first and second-largest foreign purchasers. The USCMA will ensure this trade continues and grows.

U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Canada and Mexico support more than 2 million jobs at 43,000 manufacturing businesses across our country.

Canada and Mexico are the largest purchasers of American manufactured goods – purchasing more than the next 10 U.S. trading partners combined.

America’s premier industry is automobile-related. We need to pass the USMCA to protect it from abuses and unfair trade practices.

The United States Trade Representative estimates that the USMCA will add $34 billion in automotive investment and will create 76,000 new American jobs over 5 years – figures that come from the automobile-related companies themselves.

The USMCA will encourage investment and manufacturing growth in the U.S. by establishing higher content requirements for U.S. components. The agreement also transforms supply chains to use more U.S. content to encourage suppliers to locate future production in the U.S.

Every day that the USMCA goes unsigned, America loses. Friends, adversaries and enemies are looking at the USMCA as a barometer as to how to treat us and what they can get away with.

Now is the time to act. NAFTA is outdated, ineffective and hurtful to our economy and our workers. Letting the USMCA languish is a gross dereliction of duty by Congress.

248,Kristan Hawkins: Georgia boycott is a Hollywood temper tantrum that will hurt women,Kristan Hawkins,"The entertainment industry faces a conundrum as it carries on a widespread temper tantrum aimed at states where legislators acted to protect preborn babies -- raise costs or raise Cain. Currently, threats of economic devastation through loss of jobs and income are being launched at the people of Georgia where a law recently passed limits abortion early in pregnancy, though they are not alone in expressing their pro-life convictions in law.

In response, Hollywood denizens have called for a boycott of the state known to be a cost-effective partner in many media productions. Their message: We won’t come to Georgia to fake kill people in our movies and television shows, unless you kill people for real through abortion.

Georgia is known as one of the best states for filming because of tax incentives that welcome production. The Atlantic reports that the incentives led to ”92,000 jobs and nearly $4.6 billion in wages to the state since 2008.”

NETFLIX, DISNEY CONSIDER BOYCOTTING GEORGIA, CONTINUE PARTNERSHIPS WITH EGYPT, CHINA

Right now, 34 productions are underway in the state, where movies like the ""Hunger Games,"" the Marvel franchise and AMC’s ""The Walking Dead"" have come to life.

The motion picture industry has profited by a partnership with family-friendly Chick-fil-A investment through Pinewood Atlanta Studios, which is currently engaged in a $1 billion production in the state, providing jobs and opportunity despite possible differences in values. And Georgia is not the only state moved to protect life and to be a friend to the film industry, including Louisiana, Alabama and Ohio.

This indignation aimed at Georgia is rather selectively engaged and misses some important details … like whether the celebrities even have any work going and who will really pay the price for lost revenue.

About boycott supporters, The Wrap reports: “Several prominent producers, like Reed Morano and Judd Apatow, have said they would boycott filming in Georgia in response to the law. Producers David Simon, Christine Vachon, Mark Duplass, Nina Jacobson and Neal Dodson have already boycotted shooting in the state altogether — though none of these was known to have any projects slated for production in the state.”

Mega content creator Netflix, which has produced its blockbuster ""Stranger Things"" in Georgia, has pledged to pull its business from the state if the pro-life law goes into effect. Meanwhile, mega content producers like Sony Pictures, WarnerMedia, Disney, CBS (and Showtime), and Viacom say they are taking a wait-and-see approach to states that have both welcomed the film industry with friendly policy and dared to also welcome preborn infants.

AMC TO RETHINK FILMING 'THE WALKING DEAD' IN GEORGIA IF ABORTION LAW TAKES EFFECT

All of the drama ignores the fact that its people in the entertainment industry who may be hurting the most should a boycott take place. As noted by The Atlantic, “Is it really possible for companies to stand with Georgia’s women by threatening to leave thousands of them jobless?”

For all the angst in Hollywood over Georgia’s concerns for the preborn, where is the anger or advocacy over the entertainment industry’s connections to nations like Saudi Arabia and China, Abu Dhabi, Egypt, Dubai, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. The human rights issues related to these countries, including simply allowing women to vote or enter into a contract without permission, are long and well documented. Yet Hollywood turns its wrath on the people of Georgia who for a decade have been a friend to the film industry.

It’s rather tone-deaf of an industry that prospers when telling empathetic stories to choose to become cultural bullies. The people of Georgia, acting through their elected officials, welcomed the film industry to the state with tax incentives and accommodation. And they welcomed both mother and preborn child through a new law that respects the humanity of both.

Maybe the entertainment icons should consider that the future of their industry depends on an audience that deserves respect and a chance at the kind of life enjoyed by those lobbying against actors still in the womb.

While even Disney contemplates rejecting the people of Georgia for their support of young families, the words of Walt Disney are worth repeating: “Our heritage and ideals, our code and standards – the things we live by and teach our children – are preserved or diminished by how freely we exchange ideas and feelings.”","The entertainment industry faces a conundrum as it carries on a widespread temper tantrum aimed at states where legislators acted to protect preborn babies -- raise costs or raise Cain.

249,Paul Batura: Dodgeball isn’t ‘legalized bullying’ – This game has valuable life lessons to teach our kids,Paul Batura,"Academics are meeting in Vancouver, Canada this week as part of the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, an annual gathering designed to both study and challenge longstanding cultural norms.

Believe it or not, included in the myriad of topics on the docket for discussion is the game of dodgeball, a sport that immediately conjures up memories (good and bad) of gym class for almost anyone who attended traditional school as a child.

According to the trio of presenters in Vancouver, dodgeball should be banished to the ash heap of history because it “reinforces the five faces of oppression” – specifically, exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism and violence. One researcher called the game “tantamount to legalized bullying.”

DODGEBALL IS NOT CHILD’S PLAY BUT ‘LEGALIZED BULLYING’ CANADIAN RESEARCHERS CLAIM

Growing up, I always appreciated my teachers and professors and I’m friends today with many people who make their living in the classroom. I have a great deal of respect for higher education.

But I’m immediately suspicious whenever I read academic treatises like this one that uses sophisticated and loaded terms to describe something as simple and straightforward as a game played with soft rubber balls.

Like dodgeball, we’re also called to protect other people in our care or on our team, blocking and shielding them from the “slings and arrows” of everyday life.

In short, many critics of dodgeball don’t like the sport because there are clear winners and losers – and to get there, sometimes the big kids pick on the small ones, albeit at times with unnecessarily cruel tactics.

The origin of dodgeball dates back over 200 years to Africa, where the game was reportedly played with rocks and putrefied matter. It was a fight of the fittest and sometimes turned deadly.

A Christian missionary from England named Dr. James Carlisle was appalled by the bloody and violent nature of the contests, but became intrigued by the agility of the competitors as well as the teamwork that each team employed.

Inspired by the potential he saw in the positive attributes of a game with admittedly negative aspects, he brought the concept back to St. Mary’s College, where soft balls replaced the hard rocks.

That same year visitors from Yale University in the United States, likewise impressed with the game, introduced a version of dodgeball to American students. Phillip Ferguson of Yale is credited with redesigning the game in 1884 and in 1905 he wrote the first official rules.

I loved dodgeball growing up – and still love the game today. I was never the best athlete or the most popular kid in my class, but I held my own and found the action-packed suspense of each contest to be exciting.

Who would be left standing? When Mr. Russ, our elementary school gym teacher, blew that whistle and those red rubber balls started flying, my adrenaline soared liked an eagle in high flight. It was simple fun.

Mr. Russ’ version of the game had a provision that allowed players to re-enter if someone on their team scored a basket on the opponent’s side of the court – a “Hail Mary” shot, to be sure. A highlight of my childhood was sinking one of those tosses – and being mobbed by my fellow teammates as they flooded back onto the floor. It felt good to be needed and come through for them in the end.

Granted, not everybody likes dodgeball – my wife included. But Julie doesn’t see the sport as part of an imperialistic plot to exploit and marginalize kids. Instead, she realizes that you sometimes do things in life that you don’t like and one person’s disdain is often another person’s delight. She likens it to making a kid take a music class, which she loved – but others don’t.

At the root of the visceral and over-the-top reaction to dodgeball is an unfortunate and evolving trend to overreact to anything that may or may not simply need correction. The proverbial phrase of ‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater” comes to mind.

Just because a few bad apples may have unfairly played the game from time to time, does that justify eliminating it? No.

I’m reminded of the push in the early part of the 20th century to ban college football, a movement started due to rising fatalities in the sport.

In response to the escalating furor, President Theodore Roosevelt, a fan of the game and a hearty sportsman himself, convened a meeting at the White House. He urged attendees to amend the rules of the game, which they did, ushering in a new era of the sport. As a result, college football survived – and has thrived ever since.

Like many sports, dodgeball is a metaphor for life. As Julie indicated, sometimes you’re called to play a game you don’t like – and you just have to do the best you can with what you’ve got at the time.

But the applications don’t end there.

Any successful life requires agility and the ability to set a goal and hit your target – and yes, deflect, endure and survive return fire.

Like dodgeball, we’re also called to protect other people in our care or on our team, blocking and shielding them from the “slings and arrows” of everyday life.

Finally, the reality is that like in every game of dodgeball, sometimes you get knocked down and out, even relegated to the sidelines to await the next round.

In the end, though, every setback has within it the seeds of a comeback, and – like the red rubber balls of my dodgeball youth – we’re made to bounce back from any challenge that comes our way.

254,Jerry Seinfeld and his wife Jessica reveal the secret behind their lasting marriage,Stephanie Nolasco,"Love is still in the air for Jerry Seinfeld and his wife of 20 years, Jessica Seinfeld.

According to the star, the secret behind their lasting marriage is surprisingly simple — comedy.

JERRY SEINFELD EXPLAINS WHY HE TURNED DOWN $5 MILLION OFFER

“From the day I met her, that was really our connection,” the 65-year-old told Closer Weekly on Friday. “We always have fun and we laugh and she’s got a great sense of humor. She’s very quick and sarcastic and all the qualities that I like. She’s very sharp. She catches all the wrongness.”

“All the badness,” chimed the 47-year-old. “… We just make each cry and laugh all day.”

The couple tied the knot in 1999 and are proud parents to three children: Sascha, 18, Julian Kal, 16, and Shepherd Kellen, 13.

And apparently, time does fly for the pair.

“You know what, we got married in ’99,” reflected the “Seinfeld” alum to the outlet. “I thought, I think you thought, ‘Boy, the math will be so easy’ and it’s not, it’s impossible.”

“So this is 20?” the comedian asked his wife, who reminded him that their 20th anniversary is at the end of the year.

“So this December will be 20 years? Wow. That’s amazing,” he gushed to the outlet.

Jessica said her spouse has long been supportive of her work with Good + Foundation, a nonprofit she founded that aims to combat poverty. According to its site, the nonprofit pairs “tangible goods with innovative services for low-income fathers, mothers and caregivers, creating an upward trajectory for the whole family.”

“I think it’s very natural,” Jessica explained about the couple’s devotion to their passion projects. “I don’t think it’s something we think about. I think, I love what he does and I support his work and he has really responded to the work that we do and has been there from the beginning and has heard me and watched me and listened to me. And he naturally just wants to be there and be supportive because he loves the work and he loves me.”

WHY 'SEINFELD' IS OFFENDING MILLENNIALS

In late 2018, Seinfeld told Us Weekly that the duo enjoys trying new eateries to keep the marriage fresh. It’s also the perfect compromise for a homebody (him) and a social butterfly (her) that has worked over the years.

“That’s a great adventure for us,” he said. “That’s what I like to do. Jess is more geographically adventurous than I am. She wants to see the world. But I’m more interested in the new restaurant.""

The couple have also been dedicated parents determined to give their children as normal of an upbringing as possible.

“They have their little nastiness, and you know, they close themselves in their rooms and stuff,” said Seinfeld at the time. “But you can just barge in and go, ‘OK. Out of the room, off the screen.’ You can push them around still.”

Seinfeld also previously told Oprah.com how the pair tackles marital fights.

JERRY SEINFELD KEEPS HOPE ALIVE OF POSSIBLE REBOOT

“The best piece of advice I received before I got married was, ‘Be careful what you say when you’re in a fight because it could stick in someone’s head,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve ever said anything I really regretted. I’m very sympathetic to women. I’ve really studied wifeology, and I know you’ve got to figure out the feelings. Deal with the feelings.”

“If you’re a man, you have to figure out what she needs to hear,” he continued. “So ask her: ‘What do you need to hear me say?’ And then just say it. That’s a very good way out of an argument. But then you have to act — you have to say it as you mean it. Even our kids have this thing where, if you say, ‘I’m sorry,’ they go, ‘No, say a nice sorry.’ If it’s not a nice sorry, it doesn’t count.”

Seinfeld also revealed monogamy comes naturally to him and he wouldn’t have it any other way.

“My personal viewpoint is this: The problem with humans is our heads are just way too big,"" he said. ""And one of the greatest appeals of monogamy is the simplification of the mental process. I don't have any friends who aren't faithful to their wives, but if I did, my main question would be, ‘Who's got time to figure all that out?’ It's just too much work.

“The emotions that have to be disposed of, the values, the ethics... All I see is this gigantic amount of work for a fleeting pleasure. People should get married because they have finally seen the folly of being single: ‘Oh, this is all just kind of a bad magic trick. I just keep bending over to reach for this wallet on a string. How much longer am I gonna do that?’""","Love is still in the air for Jerry Seinfeld and his wife of 20 years, Jessica Seinfeld.
According to the star, the secret behind their lasting marriage is surprisingly simple — comedy.

255,"‘All That’ star Lori Beth Denberg talks Nickelodeon reboot, reprising Loud Librarian role: ‘It’s weird’",Stephanie Nolasco,"For Nickelodeon, the ‘90s are officially back.

The TV network recently unveiled its new cast of seven teens and tweens for the reboot of their popular sketch comedy series “All That.” The revival’s premiere, which is making a debut on June 15, will feature original cast members Lori Beth Denberg, Josh Server and Kel Mitchell, who also serves as executive producer alongside Kenan Thompson.

'LEAVE IT TO BEAVER' STAR TELLS ALL

Denberg, 43, who reprised her Loud Librarian character, told Fox News it felt as if no time has passed. The original series aired from 1994 until 2005.

“It’s weird,” she explained. “When I talk to some of the original cast members like Kel and Josh that have been back, it’s weird that it’s not weird. I walked onto the Loud Librarian set, which I haven’t been on in [over] 20 years... it’s the same. I’ve got the script, I’m doing the Loud Librarian and it’s like no time has passed. But it’s been 25 years.”

While “All That” now features a whole new set of characters and child actors, Denberg insisted fans of the original show will quickly embrace what Nickelodeon has to offer.

“I think the biggest thing is just that everyone’s continuing with the same show that was on 25 years ago, meaning it’s smart, it’s irreverent, it’s wacky, it’s edgy,” said Denberg. “It’ll be messy, I’m sure. All the great things that you love about the original ‘All That,’ and I think just folding in the boys as producers and us as original cast members — it's going to bring in the parents that used to watch us, and the kids. Everyone’s going to love each other. But, it’s really meshing the old and the new together into kind of a seamless blob of comedy.”

CHRIS FARLEY'S BROTHER TELLS ALL

Chinguun Sergelen, a newcomer who's been acting since he was 9, said he’s proud to offer entertainment that will bring families together.

“When you get older, you just remember those moments you had with family and cousins or really good friends when you had the best time of your life,” said the 13-year-old. “Because I… was hanging out with my mom and my aunts and cousins. Man, those were the days.”

“I am so glad that I can be a part of a show that is so hilarious,” chimed Kate Godfrey, 15. “So families all across the world can watch it, laugh together, be together and enjoy it together.”

While it’s still unknown whether more original cast members will appear in the reboot, Denberg teased that it’s a big possibility. The series is known for launching the careers of several stars, including Nick Cannon and Amanda Bynes.

FARRAH FAWCETT'S PALS TELL ALL

“I’m sure that plenty of the old crew will show up here and there,” said Denberg. “That’s part of the fun of doing this — folding in original cast members and original characters with all the great new stuff that these guys are bringing to the table. I don’t have any secret information to give you, and if I did, I couldn’t tell you because it would be secret information, by definition. But, I’m sure people will show up when you least expect them, bringing back some of your old favorites and some new stuff.”

Denberg previously told Entertainment Weekly she was surprised at being asked to do some of her classic sketches, assuming she was merely on set to pass on the torch to the new cast. However, Denberg insisted she was thrilled to revisit her childhood.

“It has been really fun, and a little surreal to come back and for me, do characters that I haven’t done in 25 years,” she said. “But the best part in the whole world has been getting to hang out with these [new] guys and watch them work. The cast is so fun, smart, funny… [and] energetic. There’s just such a good vibe on the set and that’s my favorite part.”

Denberg insisted that she hopes original viewers will enjoy a blast from the past, all while introducing new audiences to a lighter, more family-friendly form of comedy.

ELVIS PRESLEY'S PAL TELLS ALL

“I hope they have a good time,” said Denberg. “I hope they are able to discover what people liked so much about the original… You know… the ‘90s kids who are all grownups now, come up to me and are like, ‘[This show] made my childhood. It was my favorite thing.’ It’s really nice to look back on something I’m proud of and have it been so well-received and hold a place in people’s hearts.”

There were at least two scary moments: At one point Goldberg grabbed the Undertaker and flipped him backward, narrowly avoiding what could have been a neck or shoulder injury.

At another point, the Undertaker flipped Goldberg upside-down in a “piledriver” move, landing Goldberg on his head. The piledriver is considered by many to be the most controversial move in wrestling.

Goldberg may have suffered a concussion, Ringside News reported.

257,Boston Dynamics' creepy robot dog is going up for sale,Chris Ciaccia,"Videos of Boston Dynamics' robots have been the stuff of both awe and inspiration, as well as nightmares. Now, it appears the robots will be doing more than just performing parkour or dancing around on YouTube.

They're going up for sale.

According to The Verge, who interviewed Boston Dynamics’ CEO Marc Raibert at Amazon's Re:MARS conference in Las Vegas, Spot, the company's dog-like robot and arguably its cutest machine, will be available for purchase ""within months"" and certainly before the end of 2019.

BOSTON DYNAMICS' TERRIFYING ROBOTS CAN NOW RUN, JUMP AND CLIMB

“We’re just doing some final tweaks to the design,” Raibert said in the interview. “We’ve been testing them relentlessly.”

In October, Boston Dynamics, which is now owned by Japanese conglomerate Softbank, released a video of Spot walking around construction sites in Tokyo as it began to test it ""for commercial usage around the world.""

Though interest in the robots is sure to be high, don't expect to see Spot everywhere like the latest iPhone or available on Amazon.

BOSTON DYNAMICS' LATEST ROBOT CAN OPEN DOORS

“We’re manufacturing them at a reasonably high rate for an early product,” Raibert said, adding that the company is ""aiming for 1,000 a year.” Currently, there are 50 robots available for beta testing.

Raibert refused to give a price for Spot, only stating that the commercial version would be less expensive than its prototypes ""[and] we think they’ll be less expensive than other peoples’ quadrupeds.”

On its website, the company, which got its start at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it is ""changing your idea of what robots can do"" and prides itself ""in building machines that both break boundaries and work in the real world.""

258,"San Francisco is resisting 5G, calling it 'ugly' and 'dangerous'",Brooke Crothers,"High-speed 5G connections are coming to a neighborhood near you. But not everyone wants one in their backyards.

In Upper Cole Valley, a San Francisco community, residents objected to the 5G equipment almost immediately. These objections include networking equipment that some residents deem “ugly” because it doesn’t comport with local aesthetic standards, according to a complaint from a group of Upper Cole Valley residents, as cited in a CityLab report.

Some nearby residents also said that they had not been properly notified by the city about 5G equipment and others cited RF radiation concerns, according to the complaint.

IN GOOGLE'S HOMETOWN, SOME RESIDENTS ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN RVS

The rollout of 5G is only just beginning now across the U.S. and is currently limited to select locations within a handful of cities. When the technology becomes widely available, 5G is expected to offer peak connection speeds that are many times faster than 4G.

Yet, carriers, such as Verizon, are shifting how connectivity is delivered with 5G. They are transitioning from large cell towers to so-called small cells that are often attached to street poles bringing them closer to small communities, causing the issue.

The number of small cells deployed is predicted to jump over the next few years, from 86,000 in 2018 to more than 800,000 by 2026, according to 2018 report from the CTIA, a trade association representing the US wireless communications industry. In 2017, there were about 13,000 small cells.

“This increase underscores the importance of every level of government modernizing its wireless infrastructure rules,” the report added.

So far, the California Supreme Court has thrown a wrench in these plans with an April ruling that said San Francisco can reject 5G wireless equipment that doesn’t meet local aesthetic standards.

The FCC is opposed to excessively strict aesthetic requirements for small cells. While the FCC agrees with aesthetic requirements that are “reasonably directed” to avoid “unsightly or out-of-character deployments,” aesthetic requirements cannot be more burdensome than those applied to other infrastructure equipment, the FCC said last September.

GOOGLE'S ERIC SCHMIDT: BREAKING UP BIG TECH WOULD BE 'ILLEGAL'

Another local concern is exposure to 5G RF radiation. In the Upper Cole Valley complaint, residents were concerned that while they are told exposure is not dangerous, telecom workers are warned to avoid exposure.

“Our current RF exposure limits incorporate recommendations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and other federal health and safety agencies,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wrote in an April 30 letter to Rep. Peter DeFazio (D) of Oregon.

260,Remote Indian reservation near the Grand Canyon gets broadband boost,John Brandon,"Rural Americans are often overlooked in terms of technological innovations. They will be among the last to receive faster 5G cell phone coverage, even though it is now available in major cities. In some rural areas, acquiring an HD television signal is next to impossible.

Yet, for Native Americans living in remote tribal communities, even connecting to high-speed Internet is a struggle, relying instead on archaic dial-up connections.

One study by the American Indian Policy Institute found that about a third of all Native Americans lack broadband access. A study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office disputes that claim, suggesting that access in tribal areas is much worse than that.

RURAL AMERICA STILL STRUGGLING FOR ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICE

Ophelia Watahomigie-Corliss represents the Havasupai tribe near the Grand Canyon, one of the smallest rural communities in the U.S. She tells Fox News the biggest challenge has to do with kids receiving an education, which is harder without broadband.

“[Our schools] only go up to eighth grade and the only option for high school is to move out of the canyon to earn their diploma [due to lack of the Internet],” says Watahomigie-Corliss.

That might change now that the FCC has ruled that some spectrum, known as Educational Broadband Service or EBS, will be dedicated specifically to the Havasupai tribe. The FCC is expected to make a general ruling about spectrum allocation for all tribal areas next month.

AMAZON PLANS TO OFFER SATELLITE-POWERED INTERNET

Even then, there is an issue of installing broadband equipment.

Martin Casado, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is also the founder of the non-profit company MuralNet, which is helping bring broadband to tribal areas. He tells Fox News that the problem is corporate greed. Telecom companies refuse to install the base stations and backhaul locations necessary to make it all work in rural communities.

“Telecoms won’t do this unless you have enough of a population,” he says. “And they don’t know how to make it financially solvent. In Africa, you might not have the basics like electricity, but in the United States we have the infrastructure all in place to make this happen.”

NEW SATELLITES COULD SAVE AMERICANS $30B ON MONTHLY INTERNET BILLS, REPORT SAYS

Casado says MuralNet uses low-cost networking equipment that is then re-programmed with their software. The installs help make broadband access more affordable and viable for rural areas. The company piggybacks on the EBS rulings to provide broadband to tribal residents.

Watahomigie-Corliss says there’s another issue. Some initiatives, such as online school and telemedicine, depend on high-speed Internet. She’s thankful the spectrum is now allocated, but the process of rolling out services that rely on broadband will take time.

Gary Bolton, a spokesperson for the networking company ADTRAN, tells Fox News that there are additional complications. In rural areas, the terrain, which could include mountains or remote farmland -- is more complex and requires more technical planning. “About 19 million Americans are on the losing side of the digital divide,” he says.

262,Former Bengal charged with assault for attacking wife and sister with golf club in front of son: police,Talia Kaplan,"Former Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Jonathan Fanene faces kidnapping and assault charges for allegedly using a pipe, broom handle and golf club to assault his sister and wife in front of their 9-year-old son.

Court documents filed this week in the district court of American Samoa revealed the alleged attack on May 26th was over accusations he had an extramarital affair while on a trip to Hawaii.

The couple’s son told police his father ordered him to grab “the bat” and when he couldn’t find one, he brought a golf club, broom handle and a pipe and said he then saw Fanene “use these objects to assault” his mother and aunt, according to court documents.

“He beat them as hard as he can,” Fanene’s son told investigators.

According to the affidavit, he added: “My mom told him to stop, in a crying way.""

PATRIOTS RELEASE FANENE

Fanene’s wife, who police said was covered in bruises on one side of her body, filed the criminal complaint three days after the alleged assault. She told police that her sister-in-law informed her that Fanene was seen in Hawaii with another woman and when she confronted her husband about it he “flew into a rage” and assaulted his sister “with his hands,” according to the affidavit.

She told police that Fanene used the pipe, broom handle and golf club to assault her and her sister-in-law, according the affidavit which also revealed that when his wife was able to grab and remove the pipe and stick from Fanene he allegedly “grabbed a commercial grade extension cord, wound it around his hand, and proceed[ed] to whip her and her sister-in-law with it.”

Fanene’s wife told police that at one point he “hit her so hard that she ‘blacked-out’ momentarily,” adding that she “thought he was going to kill her right there and then.”

The affidavit outlined other alleged assaults dating back to 2009, which included two incidents where Fanene allegedly held a gun to his wife’s head and another alleged attack where he stomped on her head after she found an email he sent to another woman.

ADAM 'PACMAN' JONES, FORMER ALL-PRO DEFENSIVE BACK, ARRESTED AFTER REPORTED INCIDENT CASINO

Fanene was drafted by the Bengals in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL draft and played seven seasons with the team. He played for New England in 2012, but was released after he was injured in training camp.

He most recently served as director of the American Samoa Department of Youth and Women’s Affairs but lost his job after American Samoa’s acting governor, Lt. Gov. Lemanu Palepoi Sialega Mauga, found out about the alleged incident.

“Based on the information I received from the Police Commission, my decision is to terminate Mr. Fanene,” Mauga told the Associated Press on Wednesday.

Fanene, who has been charged with eight felonies and five misdemeanors, has been released on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court next week.

“America likes winners,” noted Kilmeade. “And, while the men struggle, we have talent. We don’t execute in the big tournaments. The women have. They have three World Cups already. Their win in 2015…And, they’re favorites to do it again, but they’re going to have their hands full.”

267,"Google rewards reputable reporting over left-wing politics, Economist study finds",Christopher Carbone,"President Trump and other Republicans have accused Google of anti-conservative bias a number of times over the last few years, while the tech giant has said its algorithm and worker-powered systems don't take ideology into account.

During his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said ""it's not possible for individual employees to manipulate our search results,"" in response to questions about alleged bias.

In an attempt to clear the waters, The Economist set up an experiment that compared the new site's share of search results with a statistical prediction based on its output, reach and accuracy.

YOUTUBE CRACKDOWN BLOCKED HISTORY TEACHERS WHO SHARED ARCHIVE FOOTAGE OF HITLER

The publication wrote a program to obtain Google results for any keyword; then, using a browser with no history, in what they call a ""politically centrist part of Kansas,"" they searched for 31 terms for each day in 2018 — garnering 175,000 links.

""Next, we built a model to predict each site's share of links Google produces for each keyword, based on the premise that search results should reflect accuracy and audience, as Google claims,"" The Economist reports.

The business publication worked with Meltwater, a media-tracking firm, to examine each outlet's popularity on social media, and they used accuracy ratings from several sources, including fact-checking websites, tallies of Pulitzer Prizes and results from a poll by YouGov about Americans' trust in 37 different publications.

These conditions were meant to approximate some of the factors, such as trustworthiness and expertise, that Google uses to determine search results.

US ELECTIONS IN 2020 NEED MASSIVE OVERHAUL TO PROTECT THEM, SECURITY EXPERTS WARN

If the Mountain View, Calif. company favored liberal-leaning sites, they would be expected to appear more often than The Economist's model predicted. But that was not the case.

Their model expected The New York Times to account for 9.2 percent of Google's news results, but it got 7.7 percent. The model predicted Fox News to get 2.6 percent of results, but it actually got 3.2 percent.

""Overall, center-left sites like The New York Times got the most links, but only about as many as our model suggested. Fox News beat its modest expectations. Because far-right outlets had bad trust scores, they got few search results,"" the study concluded. ""But so did Daily Kos, a far-left site.""



Few people understand how Google actually works when you type a query into the box, but the process involves a mix of machines and humans.

The tech company’s crawlers, which are constantly scanning every page on the World Wide Web for new content and links, store copies of the web pages in the company’s massive index — which, if stacked as pages of a book, would stretch to the Moon and back 12 times. The software matches your query with terms on the most relevant pages and ranks those pages based on authoritativeness and relevance prior to producing your results.

THIS UNFINISHED ARIZONA 'FUTURISTIC HIPPIE COMMUNE' HAS A PROBLEM

Meanwhile, the algorithms are constantly being improved: About 10,000 search quality raters around the world are conducting thousands of tightly controlled search experiments – there were 30,000 experiments that resulted in 2,500 changes to search last year – to rate whether results are producing accurate, correct information. The guidelines, which run to 164 pages, give raters a detailed, methodical way to evaluate how a webpage works and whether it delivers quality content for users.

However, the business publication admits that their study does not definitively ""prove"" that bias does not exist — since it can't account for the possible bias or partisanship of fact-checkers or Pulitzer voters.

According to The Economist, Google's main form of favoritism is simply to ""boost viral articles.""

""The most incendiary stories about Mr. Trump come from leftist sources. Gory crime coverage is more prevalent on right-leaning sites. Readers will keep clicking on both.""

268,"US elections in 2020 need massive overhaul to protect them, security experts argue",Christopher Carbone,"A sweeping overhaul of America's electoral infrastructure is needed in order to prevent foreign interference as the 2020 elections loom, a group of security researchers has concluded.

Former Facebook chief security officer Nick Stamos – who witnessed the sinister social media campaign orchestrated by Russian agents against America – and his colleagues at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center published a 108-page report that recommends a wide range of actions to prevent a repeat of what took place in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including better coordination between government agencies and and social media organizations.

The report, which is called ""Securing Our Cyber Future: Innovative Approaches to Digital Threats,"" can be read in full here. It details a range of recommendations, including:

Increasing the security of U.S. electoral infrastructure by requiring that all vote-counting systems nationwide provide a voter-verified paper audit trail and requiring risk-limited auditing for all elections.

Regulate online political advertising by foreign governments and nationals by explicitly prohibiting them from targeting the American electorate and passing the Honest Ads Act, which would require far more transparency in digital political advertising.

Confront efforts at foreign media manipulation by mandating additional disclosure measures during pre-election periods.

Combating state-sponsored disinformation campaigns from state-aligned actors by creating norms for the media's handling of stolen information, expanding transparency for paid and unpaid political content, establish norms among candidates to not use stolen data or manipulated content and increase overall transparency on social media platforms.

Establish international norms and agreements to prevent election interference by appointing a senior U.S. government representative for it, developing guidelines about platform cooperation among democracies and strengthening international rules for election safety.

Deter foreign governments from election interference by enacting country-specific responses that impose real costs, promoting collective engagement with international partners and conducting a continuous strategic disruption campaign against adversaries that seek to interfere with American elections.

Some of the Stanford report's proposals are already in the process of being enacted by tech companies or have been proposed by lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

Another issue the report calls out is the lack of access to data related to disinformation campaigns.

""At the moment, access to the content used by disinformation actors is generally restricted to analysts who archived the content before it was removed or governments with lawful request capabilities,"" the report states. ""Congress needs to establish a legal framework within which the metadata of disinformation actors can be shared in real-time between social media platforms, and removed disinformation content can be shared with academic researchers under reasonable privacy protections.""","A sweeping overhaul of America's electoral infrastructure is needed in order to prevent foreign interference as the 2020 elections loom, a group of security researchers has concluded.

279,These are the 25 hottest collector cars of 2019,Gary Gastelu,"The summer collector car auction season is in full swing and it’s not all about multi-million classics.

Outfits like Mecum, Barrett-Jackson and others do most of their volume in the mid-priced arena, but those buyers are still looking for a return on their investment.

So what are the hottest cars for 2019? Well, according to the Hagerty Vehicle Rating, they’re trucks.

Topping the list, which tracks interest in vehicles based on sales prices and insurance policies quoted and initiated by Hagerty, is the original 1966-1977 Ford Bronco, which has been having a moment thanks in part to anticipation about its long-awaited successor that’s set to go on sale in 2020. Prices for top examples of the off-roader have doubled in just the past three years.

BIZARRE FORD F-150 SPOTTED. COULD IT BE THE NEW BRONCO?

The second generation 1978-1979 Bronco is tied for second place with its top rival, the 1973-1991 Chevrolet C/K Blazer. Hagerty valuation editor Andrew Newton says this is likely because the first gen Fords are starting to get too expensive.

The 1963-1983 Jeep Wagoneer – another SUV about to get a reboot – and 1967-1972 Chevrolet C/K pickup are in a five-way tie for fourth with the first sports cars on the list, the 1977-1981 Toyota Celica, 1990-1996 Nissan 300ZX, 1993-2002 Mazda RX7 and 1999-2002 BMW M Coupe, which is affectionately known as the ""Clown Shoe"" and has been selling for an average price of $45,300. That’s up more than $10,000 so far in 2019.

The top 10 actually turns out to be a dozen, with a three-way tie for the last spot that includes the 1973-1987 Chevrolet C/K pickup, 1981-1986 Jeep CJ-Scrambler pickup -- boosted by the arrival of the new Jeep Gladiator – and the original 1990-1988 Mazda MX-5 Miata.

281,Former NASCAR CEO Brian France pleads guilty to DWI in New York,Gary Gastelu,"Former NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in exchange for a reduced sentence on Friday.

Upon completion of 100 hours of community service, France will have the misdemeanor DWI changed to a non-criminal violation in June of next year, as long as he doesn’t get into any trouble in the meantime and attends counseling.

""While I made a mistake, this event has also given me the opportunity to reflect on my poor judgment that day, my family and my greater responsibilities to our community. I have learned valuable lessons and will be a better person because of this process,"" France said in a statement, according to USA Today.

France was arrested in Sag Harbor, N.Y., in August 2018 when he rolled through a stop sign and was allegedly found to have a blood alcohol content twice the legal limit and oxycodone pills in his possession, for which he had a prescription.

France took a leave of absence from NASCAR following the arrest and was permanently replaced in both roles by his uncle Jim France earlier this year.

283,Bizarre Ford F-150 Raptor spotted. Could it be a new Bronco?,Gary Gastelu,"Ford is rebooting Bronco brand next year with an all-new off-road truck inspired by the 1966 original along with a “Baby” Bronco crossover.

But could a big Bronco also be in the works?

A strange-looking black truck was spotted recently near Ford HQ wearing manufacturer plates that suggests one may be.

It appears to be a Ford F-150 Raptor with a two-door standard cab and a short bed, which doesn’t exist in production. In fact, you can’t buy any F-150 in that configuration.

Put a cap on it, though, and it would look a lot like a modern version of the last F-Series-based Bronco that rolled off the assembly line in 1996, two years after one featured in the infamous O.J. Simpson police chase.

However, automakers often cobble together what are known as “mules” to test new components, and since the truck isn’t wearing any type of disguise its possible that it’s just one of these. A Ford spokeswoman would not comment on the images to Fox News Autos.

A similarly unusual white truck wearing camouflage has also been photographed on public roads that’s based on a Ranger, as the Bronco will be, so it is almost certainly involved in its development in some way.

Since the trucks are significantly different in size and componentry, it’s unlikely the Raptorette has much if anything to do with the announced Bronco. So perhaps Ford does have something big up its sleeve as it continues to shift its lineup away from cars to Trucks and SUVs.

As far as the wood bumpers are concerned, don't expect to see them on the options list.

285,Last Swedish-built Saab 9-3 to be auctioned after being stored since 2014,Gary Gastelu,"The last Saab 9-3 built in Sweden has surfaced and is going up for sale.

The 9-3 sedan came off the assembly line in Trollhattan in 2014 when production was briefly restarted as the bankrupt automaker resurfaced under Chinese ownership as National Electric Vehicle Sweden, or NEVS.

The automaker has since re-engineered the model as a battery-powered car that’s set to go into production in China this year, after 51 percent of the cash-strapped company was purchased by Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group for $930 million.

The 2014 car was the last of 420 produced and was set aside for crash testing that never occurred, according to NEVS.

THIS IS THE CAR THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO SAVE SAAB:

Originally designed under General Motors ownership, the silver compact has just 3.1 miles on the odometer – well, technically 5 km – and features a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and automatic transmission.

It will be on display at NEVS HQ in Trollhattan through June 9 and auctioned later this year.

It has not yet been determined where the proceeds from the sale will go.

Video posted to his Instagram account shows the seven-foot, one-inch, 300-pound mountain of a man slipping into the front seat of the midsize four-door and fitting in the driver’s seat with headroom to spare.

The change at the company’s distribution centers involves doing away with “clunky, big and heavy” step stools and alternatively using lighter ones, the company’s chief executive officer Doug McMillon said, according to CNBC.

He shed light on the multimillion-dollar savings concept at Walmart’s investors conference, the outlet said.

Walmart reportedly wants their tractor trailers filled to the top with goods in an effort to be efficient and reduce expenses.

The company gave its employees a step stool to help achieve this goal but it was bulky, McMillon said. As a result, it reportedly fell into disuse and the tractor trailers weren’t getting completely filled.

“We're very, extremely disappointed in hearing that today. You know, we've been through, perhaps we thought the darkest days were behind us, given the previous administration's attack and war on our business,” he told FOX Business’ David Asman during an interview on Friday.

The billionaire announced that he will donate $500 million to close all of the nation’s coal plants by 2030. The Beyond Carbon initiative was created to bypass the federal government and work with states and utilities to “phase out every last U.S. coal-fired power plant by 2030.""

“Frankly, we're real disappointed in the mayor that he would select to come after our coal miners and our coal mining families in the states like West Virginia that rely so heavily on coal-fired electric generation and coal mining and all the support jobs that really drive our economy here. And we're not alone,” Hamilton said on ""Bulls & Bears.""

There are about 15 states like West Virginia where coal mining and coal-fired electrical generation play a big role in the local and statewide economies, he said.

291,Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave this advice to those considering starting their own business,Kathleen Joyce,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos knows what it takes to be a successful businessman.

Continue Reading Below

Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 as an online book store. From there, the business expanded to the empire it is today. Bezos, Forbes’ richest person in the world, was asked at the Re: MARS conference Thursday in Las Vegas what advice he would give to those who were considering starting their own business.

“If you want to be an entrepreneur, the most important thing is to be customer obsessed,” Bezos told the crowd. “Don’t satisfy your customers, figure out to how to absolutely delight them. That is the number one thing. Whoever your customers are.”

The second thing a potential entrepreneur needs is passion, Bezos said.

“You have got to have some passion for the arena you’re going to develop and work in,” the CEO said. “Otherwise, you’re going to be competing against people who do have passion for that and they’re going to build better products and services.”

Bezos also said an entrepreneur should be a missionary, not a mercenary. Missionaries “always end up making more money” and build better products.

“They always win,” Bezos said.

Next, the Amazon founder said an entrepreneur should be willing to take risks no matter the outcome.

“You have to take risks,” he said. “You have to be willing to take risks. If you aren’t going to take risks. If you come up with a business idea and there’s no risk there, it’s probably already being done.”

The billionaire said it was possible the risk may not work but that’s OK. He said Amazon always gambled.

“You have to accept that your business is going to be in many ways an experiment and it might fail and that’s OK,” Bezos said. “That’s what risk is. The good news is that Amazon we still take risks all the time. We encourage it. We talk about failure. We should be failing.”

Bezos said failures only made the company grow.

“We need to have like billion dollar scale failure and if we’re not then we’re not swinging hard enough,” he said.

During his appearance at the conference, Bezos reiterated the phrase he liked to tell his team when they didn’t agree with something he felt strongly about.

“You don’t say ‘I’m right on this, go do this,’ you say ‘I want you to gamble with me on this,’” he said.

Also during the discussion, Bezos encountered a protester who ran onto the stage. The protester, identified as Priya Sawhney, 30, of Berkeley, Calif., was objecting to conditions at a California poultry farm that supplies Amazon, District Action Everywhere spokesman Matt Johnson said.

Tess Thompson Talley, from Kentucky, spoke with CBS on Friday about the giraffe she hunted in South Africa in 2017, that ended up going viral last year when pictures of her hunt were posted online.

Trophy hunting is a legal practice in a number of African countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

""It's a hobby, it's something that I love to do,"" Talley told the network.

""I am proud to hunt,"" she added. ""And I am proud of that giraffe.""

Talley told the outlet she ate the meat of the giraffe, and made decorative pillows and a gun case using its skin.

She explained that the specific hunting trip that caused so much uproar was actually part of conservation efforts to manage wildlife in a specific area. Though she isn’t a conservationist herself, she uses her hobby to “do my part,” she said.

""Everybody thinks that the easiest part is pulling the trigger. And it's not,"" she added. ""That's the hardest part. But you gain so much respect, and so much appreciation for that animal because you know what that animal is going through. They are put here for us. We harvest them, we eat them.""

She reiterated if her hunting wasn’t contributing to conservation efforts, she wouldn’t participate.

""Just knock down animals just to be knocking them down, and it not helping anything?"" she told CBS. ""No.""

Talley also clarified that posing with her kill is part of a hunting tradition.

""The pictures are a tradition that hunters have done long before social media,"" she said. ""When social media came around, that's when there was an issue.""

Despite the backlash she’s received from those photos -- including from people trying to get her fired -- she told CBS she’s “absolutely” still hunting.

On Friday, Fox News reached out to Talley for comment, but did not hear back immediately.

BIG-GAME HUNTERS DEFEND KILLS, SAY THEY WON’T BACK DOWN AFTER RECEIVING BACKLASH FOR POSTING PHOTOS

Talley’s photos went viral after the Twitter account Africa Digest tweeted pictures of Talley and the giraffe.

“White American savage who is partly a Neanderthal comes to Africa and shoot down a very rare black giraffe courtesy of South Africa stupidity,” read the June 2018 tweet. “Her name is Tess Thompson Talley. Please share.”

The images spurred deep emotions among those opposed to the controversial practice, including prominent animal activist and Hollywood actor Ricky Gervais, who tweeted about giraffes being endangered at the time the pictures went viral.

At the time, Talley explained her hunt to Fox News.

“The giraffe I hunted was the South African sub-species of giraffe,” she said in an email last July. “The numbers of this sub-species is actually increasing due, in part, to hunters and conservation efforts paid for in large part by big game hunting. The breed is not rare in any way other than it was very old. Giraffes get darker with age.”

She pointed out that the giraffe she killed was 18, too old to breed, and had killed three younger bulls who were able to breed, causing the herd’s population to decrease. Now, with the older giraffe dead, the younger bulls are able to continue to breed and can increase the population.

“This is called conservation through game management,” Talley said at the time, insisting hers was not a “canned” hunt.

293,"Trump administration announces plan for expanded hunting, fishing access across 1.4 million protected acres",Janine Puhak,"In a bid to increase access to public lands, the Interior Department unveiled a proposal for new and expanded hunting and fishing access to 1.4 million acres in 46 states.

The plan, announced Wednesday, would open 74 national wildlife refuges and 15 national fish hatcheries operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to outdoor sporting enthusiasts.

“Hunting and fishing are more than just traditional pastimes as they are also vital to the conservation of our lands and waters, our outdoor recreation economy, and our American way of life,” U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said of the news. “These refuges and hatcheries provide incredible opportunities for sportsmen and women and their families across the country to pass on a fishing and hunting heritage to future generations and connect with wildlife.”

GRIZZLY BEARS ON MOVE IN ROCKIES AS HUNTING IS IN LIMBO

In addition, the department plans to revise hunting and fishing rules at refuges in all states to more closely match state regulations.

Last September, land managers of the Interior Department compared federal and state hunting and fishing regulations with a goal of streamlining policies in all 50 states; the review was the first of its kind for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

“Well managed hunting and fishing are the backbone of conservation in this country, but inconsistent or overly complex regulations can act as a disincentive,” Service Principal Deputy Director Margaret Everson said in the Interior Department’s formal press release. “By aligning our refuge regulations with our state partners, we are reducing confusion and the regulatory burden on the American public, helping ensure the tradition and benefits of hunting and fishing can continue.”

""It's a dramatic statement about our commitment to access. The goal is to get more people out,” Bernhardt further elaborated of the pitch.

According to the official, a lack of access to hunting and fishing sites is one of the most common reasons Americans don’t participate in these activities.

Reps for groups including the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Delta Waterfowl and the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation were thrilled by the news, as per the release, with some social media commenters echoing similar applause.

""Awesome,"" one Twitter user wrote of the news.

“Hunting and fishing have long been two of the greatest conservation methods available,” another agreed.

“I think it is important to remember that wildlife population control is and should be a major part of refuge management to help maintain the overall health of the refuge,” another offered.

""Of course the comments are full of people who don't understand that hunting is conservation. Hope no one here complaining goes to national parks or anything, or enjoys wildlife,"" one suggested.

Other people, meanwhile, were more skeptical of the proposal's potential impact.

“This is horrible — those restrictions were put in place for specific reasons. Another blow to our Natural America,” one said.

“It just saddens me. I could not believe that really happened to us,” Rackley told KMOV. “I could not believe that still really happens in this world today.”

According to Brown, a woman on the other end of the line was willing to make dinner reservations for the group, but changed her mind upon asking for the “groom’s name” and learning there wouldn’t be one.

“She said, 'Your spouse is a woman?’” Brown said. “I said yes. And she said, ‘I’m sorry we are going to defer you to someone else because we don’t condone that kind of relationship.”

Brown said the woman also told her she was in an “unhealthy relationship.” Rackley added that she was appalled by the woman's comments, which made her feel “less than human.”

303,How Jon Bon Jovi and Jesse Bongiovi turned Hampton Water Rosé into more than just a celebrity brand,Emily Deciccio,"Jesse Bongiovi, 24, dove straight into the world of rosé on a challenge from his dad, legendary rocker Jon Bon Jovi.

It all started one night while Jesse and his Notre Dame roommate, Ali Thomas, were at his house in the Hamptons, and Jesse's dad offered them some rosé wine he jokingly referred to as ""pink juice.""

But Jesse tells Fox News that he and Ali already had their own nickname for rosé, which they usually only drank in the Hamptons.

“We said, ‘No, no, listen. Dad, you’re sitting in the Hamptons, you’re drinking Hampton Water,’"" he remembered telling his father. ""Then he did the cartoon double-take and looked at us, and said, ‘That’s hilarious, can you imagine if someone put that on a bottle?’”

CENTURIES-OLD WINE DISCOVERED IN ANCIENT SHIPWRECK

Jesse says his dad challenged the two college seniors to figure out the rosé business, and if this was something they were really interested in pursuing — and Jesse and Ali accepted. Soon, they were meeting with restaurant owners to see what they liked and disliked in rosés, and learning the logistics of importing wines and creating a design for their bottle.

“By the end of six months, we had a fully formed idea, business plan and marketing strategy,” explains Jesse. “Then we showed my dad everything we had, and the name Gérard Bertrand came up.”

Bertrand, who just happened to be a family friend, is a highly acclaimed winemaker who has been making wine in the South of France for over three decades. In fact, Bertrand is reportedly poised to take the No. 1 spot as the largest importer of French wine to the United States. And Jesse explained that once Bertrand was involved, everything “snowballed” from there.

Jesse, Ali and Jon weren't interested in “white-labeling” – or simply rebranding – an existing product. They also knew that getting someone as renowned as Bertrand on board would give the brand credibility and validity.

“We knew that if we just white-labeled a bottle, that people were going to be like, ‘What the hell does Jon Bon Jovi know about making rosé?’ and that they wouldn’t take it very seriously. But if we partnered with someone who is a second-generation winemaker, is one of the top winemakers in the South of France — people who might not have taken us seriously would take him seriously.”

RED OR WHITE? WINE PREFERENCE REVEALS DETAILS OF YOUR PERSONALITY, STUDY SAYS

After creating the actual rosé with Bertrand, the Hampton Water brand launched in April 2017 — and the 2017 production even sold out before its official release. The rosé reached critical acclaim in 2018, when Hampton Water ranked No. 83 on Wine Spectator's Top 100 list, and was also named the magazine’s best rosé of 2018.

Now, for Jesse it’s about keeping that momentum and not being labeled as a ""celebrity brand.""

“We knew that with an asset like my dad, and [his] name recognition, we’d have a great launch and get the brand out initially, but we know that if we’re not getting liquid into lips, it’s all for naught.”

Jesse tells Fox News that he and Ali are crisscrossing the country to ensure they are constantly meeting with restaurants and liquor stores to get the word out. “Our running joke is that we sleep at Terminal 5 in LaGuardia Airport.”

While Jesse and Ali are traveling across the country, Jesse says his dad has been an invaluable asset as someone to bounce ideas off when it comes to audience and marketing. Jesse also revealed that he and Ali also have an unexpected nickname for his dad.

“We like to call my dad the ‘Easter Bunn,’ and when we’re having a hard time with a place, my dad will stop in for lunch, and be like ‘Have you heard of Hampton Water?'… That’s kind of been our secret weapon when we need to get the really big things done, which has been really helpful to have.”

Jesse says the plan for Hampton Water is to grow and to disprove the summer-seasonality stereotype of rosé and move to make it into a year-round drink.

“Essentially our plan is to double the 500,000 bottles that we did last year. And we plan to do a million bottles this year, and we’re well on our way to doing that.”

304,It's National Doughnut Day: Here's half a dozen things you didn't know about 'em,Michael Bartiromo,"There isn't much anybody needs to know about doughnuts. As long as they're sweet, delicious and readily available, most Americans are pretty happy.

But on a day like National Doughnut Day, we tend to crave something more substantial. And no, we're not talking about cinnamon buns or eclairs — we get hungry for a little history.

With that in mind, we've picked out half a dozen of the tastiest facts we could find about one of America's most preferred pastry items:

#1. There seem to be two National Doughnut Days: The first is celebrated on the first Friday in June, while a second lesser-known observance takes place in early November. The first (in June) was declared in 1938 by the Salvation Army to honor the volunteers, or ""Dough Lassies,"" who made and served doughnuts to troops fighting during the first World War. The origins of November's Doughnut Day are more obscure, with some saying it began as part of a bakery's Veterans Day promotion, and others writing that a hungry Vietnam POW named Orson Swindle convinced his captors that November 10th was a huge holiday (National Doughnut Day), which surprisingly resulted in the jailers ordering everybody sticky buns.

NATIONAL DOUGHNUT DAY'S BEST DEALS

#2. There are far more Dunkin Donuts locations per capita in Massachusetts than any other state, with Slate.com estimating one location for every 6,500 people as of 2014. That said, the Boston news affiliate that once described this Dunkin Donuts truck as ""the most Boston thing ever"" is probably right on the money:

#3. The earliest cakey pastries to resemble doughnuts were spherical rather than ring-shaped (see oliekoeks, or oliebollen, below). It's unclear exactly when rings became popular, but, by his own account, a New England sailor named Hanson Crockett Gregory claims that he originated the idea. As the story goes, he cut the center from his mother's doughnuts (she packed them for him and his shipmates) because the dough was still raw in the middle. He returned home with the idea, and the ring became a thing.

#4. On New Year's Eve in the Netherlands, the Dutch traditionally eat oliebollen, or small doughnuts studded with dried fruit. The tradition of eating oliebollen (literally ""oil balls"") is thought to have originated with early Germanic tribes as a way to ward off the pagan goddess Perchta, who would fly through the skies during Yule and slice open the bellies of disobedient tribespeople. Anyone who had eaten oliebollen, however, was spared, as Perchta's sword would slide off their full, greasy bellies.

#5. Before Clark Gable did it in the 1934 film ""It Happened One Night,"" the practice of dunking doughnuts into coffee wasn't very widespread. (It's rumored to have first gained popularity within celebrity circles after silent actress Mae Murray dropped a doughnut into her coffee at Lindy's in New York.) In fact, in that same year, comedian Red Skelton developed an entire routine based around the different ways people dunk their doughnuts, which he would later perform in the 1938 film ""Having Wonderful Time.""

#6. Speaking of dunking, etiquette expert Emily Post publicly declared her distaste for the practice in 1941, writing that it's ""as bad an example of table manners as can be found."" She did, however, offer an alternative: ""Drop a mouthful at a time into the coffee and then lift it to your mouth with the spoon."" (Even still, she insists this wouldn't be proper manners. ""It's only better than worst,"" she wrote.)","But on a day like National Doughnut Day, we tend to crave something more substantial.

306,Single dad and company president urges people to stop apologizing for 'having lives' in viral essay,Janine Puhak,"One dad and company president from Chicago is winning applause for his empathetic message in a now-viral essay on LinkedIn, in which he begs people to stop apologizing for “having lives” in a culture where “constant connectivity” is an unspoken expectation of many jobs.

Last week, Ian Sohn, the president of Wunderman Chicago, a creative, data and technology agency, took to the career networking platform to implore followers to not feel guilty for having to prioritize the “life” aspect of their work/life balance – especially while raising children.

In the post, which has garnered nearly 19,000 likes and more than 700 comments, Sohn opines that from a management perspective, he “never needs to know” if staffers can work online after dinner, eschewed professional emailing on a flight in favor of watching “Arrested Development,” or plan to leave work early for their kid’s soccer game.

FAMILY STAGES SKYDIVING GENDER REVEAL

“I never need to know why you can’t travel on a Sunday. I never need to know why you don’t want to have dinner with me when I’m in your town on a Tuesday night,” the father of sons 12 and 8 wrote online, USA Today reports. “I never need to know that you’re working from home today because you simply need the silence.”

“I deeply resent how we’ve infantilized the workplace. How we feel we have to apologize for having lives. That we don’t trust adults to make the right decisions,” Sohn continued. “How constant connectivity/availability (or even the perception of it) has become a valued skill.”

“I never want you to feel horrible for being a human being,” he concluded.

Sohn’s stance on the often-debated, delicate balance of personal and professional obligations has since been hailed as refreshingly honest and “amazing” by commenters.

“This is great! Not a single parent... but I also believe this applies to everyone. (And Arrested Development seasons 1-3 are fantastic,)” another agreed.

As for the essay’s wider impact, Sohn told USA Today that he was surprised some people went so far as to describe him as “brave” for sharing his views.

308,Many Americans are experiencing ‘workout hangovers' from intense exercise routines,Dr. Aaron Hinde,"A sizable chunk of Americans are skipping work due to hangovers… from exercise.

According to new research, more than one in four active Americans (29 percent) have skipped out on work due to a workout “hangover” (post-exercise soreness that impedes one’s ability to participate in other life and work activities).

STUDY: MANY FITNESS ENTHUSIASTS MIXING WEED WITH WORKOUTS

According to the new study, as many as 55 percent have suffered a workout hangover that’s caused them to stay inside all day, and a possible major cause of this may be that sixty percent of those surveyed said they don’t know enough about dietary and recovery supplements to make an informed decision about what process or products can help them.

Due to that knowledge gap, nearly half of those respondents (47 percent) have skipped recovery steps altogether.

In fact, the new study of 2,000 Americans who exercise uncovered that 65 percent have sustained injuries from their workouts — approximately three each year on average.

The most common injuries? Pulled muscles (68 percent), ankle sprains (48 percent), and knee strains (45 percent).

And the dreaded “workout hangover” is not just affecting work attendance, it has spread into American’s social lives, as well. Forty percent of respondents reported that post-workout muscle soreness has caused them to skip a party. Thirty-nine percent have skipped a get together with friends, and 32 percent have even had to skip dates.

“So much emphasis has been placed on what you consume or drink before a workout, when in actuality it’s what your body needs to help it recover afterward that makes the real difference.” — Dr. Aaron Hinde, co-founder of LIFEAID Bev Co.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The new survey, conducted by OnePoll on behalf of health brand LIFEAID Beverage Co., found that when respondents go too hard in a workout without the proper preparation, their lives become messier.

Fitness-focused Americans spend about one fourth (23 percent) of their typical workout going “too hard,” then paying the price in the form of workout injuries and increased recovery time.

Respondents skip approximately 36 workouts a year due to the dreaded workout hangover. Why all the soreness? It may have something to do with incomplete workout recovery techniques.

In fact, 40 percent of respondents don’t stretch to aid in workout recovery. More than one in three (36 percent) don’t get enough rest after working out, and over half (53 percent) don’t take supplements.

Dr. Aaron Hinde, co-founder of LIFEAID Bev Co., stated, “Proper workout and exercise techniques go hand in hand with post-workout recovery. By helping to improve the speed and efficiency of recovery, one can directly help optimize their overall fitness in a whole new way by increasing strength, endurance... you name it.”

Hinde continues, “So much emphasis has been placed on what you consume or drink before a workout, when in actuality it’s what your body needs to help it recover afterward that makes the real difference.”

“Physical and mental fatigue from working out, particularly with today's more intense exercise routines, is manageable and avoidable with the right nutritional education and recovery products, including specially-formulated drinks and supplements,” said Dr. Hinde. “The key to avoiding the workout hangover is finding what type of products work best for your personal exercise regime, to help you recover as efficiently and effectively as possible.”","A sizable chunk of Americans are skipping work due to hangovers… from exercise.

Givhan goes on to equate fashion with diplomacy. With this equation, Givhan’s concludes, we can gain subtle insights into the president’s mind.

“For any man to bungle white-tie dress – something so regimented, so steeped in tradition, so well-documented – he must be a man who doesn’t bother with the details, who doesn’t avail himself of ready expertise, who refuses to be a student of history or even of Google,” Givhan writes. “White-tie attire is more science than art.”

She goes on in pain-staking detail to lay out how a white-tie outfit should be properly worn, and how, in her view, the “president’s iteration of white tie at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace was, in a word, a mess.”

WHY DID MELANIA TRUMP, QUEEN ELIZABETH, KATE MIDDLETON AND CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES ALL WEAR WHITE TO THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE BANQUET?

Givhan then turned her critiques to First Lady Melania Trump's outfits. Though her descriptions were far less critical, Givhan surmises that the First Lady’s choices told “a deliberate fashion story, not one rooted in historical truth.”

312,New Mexico AG issues health warning after 'vampire facial' clients contract HIV at spa,Michael Bartiromo,"New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas has issued a consumer health warning concerning “vampire facials” after two former patients from an Albuquerque spa tested positive for HIV.

“I am highly concerned that these procedures are not being regulated at the State and Federal level and am announcing a criminal investigation into this incident,” said Balderas in a release by his office.

“In addition, I am calling for action by the FDA and State Attorneys General across the nation. We cannot allow more people to fall victim.”

MARCIA CROSS SAYS ANAL CANCER LIKELY LINKED TO HUSBAND'S THROAT CANCER

Banderas’ health warning, issued on Thursday, comes just over a month after the New Mexico Department of Health encouraged clients of the VIP Spa in Albuquerque to get tested for HIV after two former patients tested positive for the virus following “injection-related” procedures.

""The likelihood that these [cases] resulted from a procedure at the spa are high,” Dr. Tierney Murphy of the health department stated at the time, KRQE reported.

As of late April, over 130 former clients had gone in for testing.

“I am highly concerned that these procedures are not being regulated at the State and Federal level and am announcing a criminal investigation into this incident."" — New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas

“Vampire facials,” or Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapies, can only be carried out by licensed nurses or physicians, the attorney general reiterated.

Maria Ruiz, the owner of the VIP Spa, held a cosmetologist’s license, which is not valid for medical procedures, KOAT reported.

""That's way beyond her scope of practice as an aesthetician, so that would not be something that we would even license,"" Kathy Ortiz, the deputy director for Boards and Commissions, told KRQE in APril. ""First off, she didn't have a license, so that was basically why we were able to close the establishment.”

KENTUCKY TODDLER'S TICK BITE CAUSED RARE DISEASE, MOM WARNS

While some believe the “vampire facial” can be effective, scientific studies have yet to prove long-lasting effects of the procedure, which involves extracting platelets from a client’s blood and injected those platelets back into the patient’s face through micro-needling. Doctors also deem the procedure itself relatively safe, but there’s always risk when it comes to handling blood.

""The risk of infection using blood products is greater than using sterile injectibles,"" New York City-based plastic surgeon Michelle Copeland, M.D., previously told Fox News. ""It's not a closed syringe, so there is a risk when transferring the product from one tube to another.""

Urging anyone in New Mexico who believes they may have received a vampire facial from an unlicensed cosmetologist, or believe they were exposed to a communicable disease, to contact the attorney general’s office.

313,New Mexico AG issues health warning after 'vampire facial' clients contract HIV at spa,New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas,"New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas has issued a consumer health warning concerning “vampire facials” after two former patients from an Albuquerque spa tested positive for HIV.

“I am highly concerned that these procedures are not being regulated at the State and Federal level and am announcing a criminal investigation into this incident,” said Balderas in a release by his office.

“In addition, I am calling for action by the FDA and State Attorneys General across the nation. We cannot allow more people to fall victim.”

MARCIA CROSS SAYS ANAL CANCER LIKELY LINKED TO HUSBAND'S THROAT CANCER

Banderas’ health warning, issued on Thursday, comes just over a month after the New Mexico Department of Health encouraged clients of the VIP Spa in Albuquerque to get tested for HIV after two former patients tested positive for the virus following “injection-related” procedures.

""The likelihood that these [cases] resulted from a procedure at the spa are high,” Dr. Tierney Murphy of the health department stated at the time, KRQE reported.

As of late April, over 130 former clients had gone in for testing.

“I am highly concerned that these procedures are not being regulated at the State and Federal level and am announcing a criminal investigation into this incident."" — New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas

“Vampire facials,” or Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapies, can only be carried out by licensed nurses or physicians, the attorney general reiterated.

Maria Ruiz, the owner of the VIP Spa, held a cosmetologist’s license, which is not valid for medical procedures, KOAT reported.

""That's way beyond her scope of practice as an aesthetician, so that would not be something that we would even license,"" Kathy Ortiz, the deputy director for Boards and Commissions, told KRQE in APril. ""First off, she didn't have a license, so that was basically why we were able to close the establishment.”

KENTUCKY TODDLER'S TICK BITE CAUSED RARE DISEASE, MOM WARNS

While some believe the “vampire facial” can be effective, scientific studies have yet to prove long-lasting effects of the procedure, which involves extracting platelets from a client’s blood and injected those platelets back into the patient’s face through micro-needling. Doctors also deem the procedure itself relatively safe, but there’s always risk when it comes to handling blood.

""The risk of infection using blood products is greater than using sterile injectibles,"" New York City-based plastic surgeon Michelle Copeland, M.D., previously told Fox News. ""It's not a closed syringe, so there is a risk when transferring the product from one tube to another.""

Urging anyone in New Mexico who believes they may have received a vampire facial from an unlicensed cosmetologist, or believe they were exposed to a communicable disease, to contact the attorney general’s office.

314,New York doctors shocked by what they find during surgery on brain tumor,Brie Stimson,"Doctors at Mount Sinai in New York, who cut into a 42-year-old woman’s brain last September to remove a suspected malignant tumor, were reportedly baffled when they found a mass resembling a “quail’s egg.""

It turned out to be a baby tapeworm.

“It was very shocking,” one of the surgeons told The Washington Post. “We were scratching our heads, surprised at what it looked like.”

HOW AN INFANT'S TUMOR HAD FULLY FORMED TEETH INSIDE

After doctors removed the mass from Rachel Palma's brain they cut it open and placed it under a microscope. They realized it was a tapeworm in the larval stage.

Palma, a newlywed, was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, a parasitic brain infection caused by the Taenia solium tapeworm, according to The Post.

“Of course I was grossed out,” Palma told The Post. “But of course, I was also relieved. It meant that no further treatment was necessary.”

Larval tapeworm parasites are rare, according to the Mayo Clinic, but can be spread by people who have adult tapeworms and don't wash their hands properly after going to the bathroom. It’s unclear if that’s how Palma contracted it.

Before the surgery, Palma had suffered from hallucinations, headaches and confusion.

“Under the Equity for Education program, Chegg has created an equity pool from their existing pool of stock which will be used to pay down U.S. employees' educational loans,” the company said in a statement.

Chegg took the initiative and called on politicians in Washington, D.C. to support similar programs. The company said other companies should follow suit on their model for its employees.

""We realize the amount of debt that is taken on to pursue higher education is crushing our students, hurting families, and our economy, and we want to make an impact on the problem now. We are announcing our Equity for Education plan because we want to encourage other companies to create similar programs for their employees,"" Dan Rosensweig, the CEO and president of Chegg, said in a statement. ""The student debt statistics are daunting, and we believe it's going to take a village to solve this problem.""

Rosensweig said he believed the program would “ultimately benefit the company.”

“We believe that young Americans and their families deserve the opportunity to advance their lives through education,” he said.

The program would apply to any American employee working for the learning platform with student debt. Those who have worked at Chegg for two years will get up to $5,000 a year. Those who are at a director or vice president level can receive up to $3,000 a year.

""These new equity grants are in addition to the $1,000 cash that employees with student debt already receive each year from Chegg,"" Jenny Brandemuehl, Chief People Officer of Chegg, said in a statement. ""We believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit, which is why we also provide an additional $5,250 non-taxed reimbursement to every Chegg employee for continuing education, so they can continue to invest in their future.""

327,"Massachusetts police K-9 adopted after losing leg, job to cancer",Stephen Sorace,"A former Massachusetts police K-9 who was forced into retirement after losing its leg to cancer has found a new home, officials said Wednesday.

The three-legged Bloodhound, Blue, was diagnosed in April with a soft tissue sarcoma, a type of cancer that requires rapid intervention to prevent the disease from spreading to vital organs, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA) said in a news release earlier this month.

Doctors determined the 3-year-old dog’s best chance at survival was amputating his front right leg, where the growth had formed, the release said. The surgery effectively ended his career catching criminals with the Billerica Police Department’s K-9 unit.

But the MSCPA announced Wednesday the 3-year-old dog is now “thriving” with his new adoptive family, which includes another rescued Bloodhound named Gertrude.

“We're no longer blue bc Blue is adopted!” MSPCA-Angell tweeted Wednesday, along with photos of the happy dog.

329,San Diego hospital announces birth of world’s tiniest surviving baby,Louis Casiano,"A San Diego hospital on Wednesday announced the birth of what's thought to be the world's tiniest surviving baby, who weighed just 8.6 ounces and was smaller than an apple.

Baby Saybie -- a name used by her care team -- was born in December 2018 and discharged this month from the Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns as a healthy five-pound infant, the hospital said in a news release. She is believed to be the world's smallest surviving newborn, according to the Tiniest Babies Registry, which is maintained at the University of Iowa.

WORLD'S 'SMALLEST SURVIVING BABY BOY' DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL

Her mother gave birth via emergency cesarean section at 23 weeks' gestation. She weighed seven grams less than the previous smallest surviving newborn, who was born in Germany in 2015, according to the hospital.

""She was small and fragile, and could fit in the palm of the hands of her care team,"" the hospital said.

Doctors said the premature birth was necessary because Saybie was not gaining weight and her mother's life was at risk. She was considered a micropreemie, a baby born before 28 weeks. That early a birth comes with a host of life-threatening medical challenges, the hospital said.

""Saybie experienced virtually none of the medical challenges typically associated with micropreemies, which can include brain bleeds and lung and heart issues,"" it said.

330,"Army veteran’s family demand answers after he died in Pennsylvania jail, had brain, heart and throat removed",Lucia Suarez Sang,"The family of an Army veteran is demanding answers from Pennsylvania authorities more than a year after he mysteriously died inside a local jail and had his organs removed but never returned.

Everett Palmer Jr, 41, had traveled from his home in Delaware to Lancaster County, Pa., on April 7, 2018, to resolve an outstanding warrant for a DUI charge.

What was supposed to be a routine trip en route to New York ended in tragedy when the father of two boys died two days later at the York County Prison.

“We want answers. We want to understand what happened,” his brother Dwayne Palmer told NY1.

PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN, 51, DIED IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AS THREE AMERICAN TOURISTS AT DOMINICAN RESORT A YEAR AGO

An autopsy report from the York County Coroner states Palmer died after an incident in the prison where he became agitated in his cell and was later restrained. The cause of death was later updated to “complications following an excited state, associated with methamphetamine toxicity, during physical restraint.”

The family still knows little about what occurred in the lead up to Palmer’s untimely death. More troubling was when his family received the body, it was badly bruised and his brain, heart, and throat had been removed.

Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney representing the family, told the Washington Post that the body parts went missing for several months and had not been returned to the family.

“So much mystery and unanswered questions in a way that violates every policy and procedure that state has,” he added. “It’s not uncommon to remove body parts in an autopsy in order to perform a test. The only thing that’s highly uncommon is to not know where they are.”

Merritt did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment on Friday.

COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD BE RAZED BECAUSE OF 'MORBID FASCINATION,' OFFICIAL SAYS

The coroner’s report, posted by the Washington Post, said Palmer was restrained after “hitting his head against the inside of his cell door,” and was taken to the prison’s clinic, where he was “noted to be unresponsive.” He was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m. on April 9, 2019.

The family hired an independent pathologist, who first flagged the missing organs, and said the manner of death should be considered a homicide, Merritt told the Washington Post.

The Pennsylvania State Police has said that is investigating in conjunction with the York County district attorney. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office told Fox News on Thursday that it does not comment on pending or on-going investigations.

Meanwhile, the family is still seeking an explanation. His mother, Rose Palmer, told NY1 that the behavior described in the coroner’s report was out of character.

“My son was a perfectly healthy man, and my son is not going to band his head on a cell,” she said. “My son was not a troublemaker, not at all, he was a very gentle, kind man.”

The family said they hope the renewed interest in the case will prompt more information to be released or witnesses to come forward. They have also started a Justice4Everett Facebook page and hashtag.

“My brother was a good man, he comes from a good family, if he did something wrong with regards to the DUI then clearly he should be held accountable for that,” Dwayne Palmer told NY1. “But that should not be a death sentence.”","We want to understand what happened,” his brother Dwayne Palmer told NY1.

The 22 documents show that the bureau’s Scientific and Technical Services Division examined 15 hairs sent by Peter Byrne, who was head of the now-defunct Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in Oregon.

BIGFOOT SIGHTINGS: 8 BEST STATES TO SEE THE LEGENDARY SASQUATCH

“Will you kindly, to set the record straight, once and for all, inform us if the FBI has examined hair which might be that of a Bigfoot,” an August 1976 letter from Byrne says. “Please understand that our research here is serious. That this is a serious question that needs answering.”

Jay Cochran, then assistant director of the division, wrote back that while the bureau primarily examines criminal investigations, “on a case-by-case basis, in the interest of research and scientific inquiry, we make exceptions to this general policy.”

The hairs were examined in 1977 and determined to be of deer origin.

Byrne, now 93, told CNBC Wednesday he hasn't given up hope on the existence of Bigfoot.

Admiral Stavridis said Russia is ""feeling their oats with their new big brother China."" On the China-Russia alliance, Stavridis said, ""When you put Chinese population, technology and economy along with Russia's natural resources it is a big big problem."" Stavridis believes we are very close to having either a collision between our ships or an inadvertent shoot down of a Russian aircraft coming high speed at a U.S. Navy Destroyer. Stavridis said, ""The Russians need to understand we are willing to pull the trigger if we have to. That is the only way to stop this.""

When asked about what needs to be done to deal with the crisis at the border, Admiral Stavridis says we need a combination of more troops, some border wall and more technology.

Plus, Admiral Stavridis on the historical importance of the 75th anniversary of D-Day and why he feels the battle of Midway, which took place 77 years ago on June 4th, is a bigger turning point for victory in World War II because it shattered the myth of Japan's invincibility of superiority in the Pacific.

When asked about former Cincinnati Reds teammate and hall of famer Johnny Beach saying he should not be enshrined in Cooperstown after being permanently banned from MLB in 1989 for making bets while he played and managed the Reds, Rose responded by saying, ""It don't bother me but you know Johnny Bench is one guy who should thank God I was born... Because he never would have made the Hall of Fame if I wasn't born.""

Pete Rose on Johnny Bench saying he should not go into the Baseball Hall of Fame

(Kilmeade) It must bother you?

(ROSE) It don't bother me but you know Johnny Bench is one guy who should thank God I was born.

(Kilmeade) Why?

(ROSE) Because he never would have made the Hall of Fame if I wasn't born.

(Kilmeade) Why?

(ROSE) Because I'm the guy he knocked in in a thousand times. Okay. . You got you've got guys in front of you guys right behind you and you got to be responsible for everybody else involved .You should ask Joe Morgan the same question as Tony Press the same question, they are in the Hall of Fame. And I'll guarantee you they won't give you the same answer and it don't bother me that Johnny feels that way because Johnny was here was a situation with me and Johnny and people thought we didn't ever get along that weren't true. But Johnny could never understand that I was born in Cincinnati and people love the way I played and he might have been the best player on the Big Red Machine. I don't know, he's the greatest catcher ever but he was never going to be a fan favorite as long as I was there. I was born there. It's like me going to Bangor Oklahoma where he's from and getting mad if they liked Johnny more than they like me. They're probably going to like Johnny more because that's where he was born. OK So that was a problem that Johnny and I had as far as players when we played for the Cincinnati Reds.

(Kilmeade) So Tony Perez Yeah Dan Driessen. Griffey, Foster. Have you talked to any of them who back you go into the hall of fame?

(ROSE) Well they all backed me for going to the Hall of Fame but there's only two of them that are Hall of Famers and that would be Morgan and Perez. I do shows with those guys all the time. And to be honest with you I get along with Johnny today.

(Kilmeade) So if you saw him now there would be no problem?

(ROSE) No, not at all. I'll continue going around the world we live in and telling everybody he's the greatest catcher of all times. I don't get tired of saying that because it's the truth. Now I can't help it the way he feels but I would think if he's a Cincinnati fan and he cares about the city of Cincinnati that he would probably want me to be in the Hall of Fame.

(Kilmeade) So here we are. Have you heard anything from Major League Baseball?

(ROSE) No, no. I don't expect to. You know when I walked in here today to do this interview the furthest thing from my mind is the Hall of Fame. I made the Reds Hall of Fame. Wonder why Johnny didn't comment on me making a Reds Hall of Fame or me getting a statue at the ballpark or retiring my number. Why didn't you why didn't he have an opinion on those three things?","(ROSE) It don't bother me but you know Johnny Bench is one guy who should thank God I was born.

Spaghetti alla Vigliacca COWARD'S SPAGHETTI

This sauce is all about the pancetta. It uses a HUGE amount of pancetta per person. It is what it is. And what it is, is amazing. When my daughter Sophie and I were at Rocco's recently we got into a discussion with the owners about the amount of pancetta in the dish, because the quantity was more than you'd usually see atop a plate of pasta. Sophie was definitely on ""Team More"" with Rocco the chef. I felt it was a bit too much. The following recipe is the happy medium. But one thing to keep in mind is that since pancetta is the only thing going on here, try to get ahold of the best pancetta possible. Definitely do not substitute bacon and absolutely do not use anything smoked. While Trattoria Rocco makes this with run-of-the-mill spaghetti, and it's pretty great, when I make it I try to use a more artisanal brand like Faella or Gentile from Gragnano. The quality really does make a difference. You can serve the dish with ground chili pepper (Rocco sprinkles a bit along the edges of each plate). Traditionally this dish is not served with grated cheese. If you're wondering why it's called Spaghetti alla Vigliacca, I have no idea. And after much research, seemingly no one else does either. SERVES 4 OR 5 reserved pasta water. Turn up the heat and finish cooking the pasta, mixing well to distribute the pancetta and fats over the strands of spaghetti. Garnish with the parsley. Serve immediately. NOTE The pancetta pieces tend to congregate at the bottom of the pan or bowl. When serving, stir well and make sure everyone gets their fair share of pancetta!

3/4 pound pancetta 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, plus an additional tablespoon if needed 2 or 3 small Italian dried or fresh chili peppers (peperoncino), to taste Sea salt, for the cooking water 1 pound of spaghetti Minced parsley for garnish Pancetta often comes with the skin attached; if so, trim this off with a sharp knife. Slice the pancetta against the grain into 1/4-inch slices. Cut each slice into 1/4-inch pieces, across the rows of fat, resulting in about 11/2 cups of little log-shaped, fat-striated pieces. Pour the olive oil into a pan large enough to fit the drained pasta later, then add the pancetta and chili peppers. Turn on the heat to medium- low and let the pancetta cook slowly and render its fat slowly. The desired texture is chewy; it shouldn't burn or even become crispy. While you are cooking it, if it looks very dry, as if there isn't enough fat, add another tablespoon of olive oil. You can tell it is done when the fat loses its translucent look and becomes opaque. It should take 10 minutes or so. Remove from the heat. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until almost al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Add the pasta to the pan with the pancetta, along with the reserved pasta water. Turn up the heat and finish cooking the pasta, mixing well to distribute the pancetta and fats over the strands of spaghetti. Garnish with the parsley. Serve immediately.

NOTE The pancetta pieces tend to congregate at the bottom of the pan or bowl. When serving, stir well and make sure everyone gets their fair share of pancetta!

Pasta con Pomodorini Schiacciati e Rughetta PASTA WITH SMASHED CHERRY TOMATOES AND ARUGULA

This is one of those effortless recipes that relies on extraordinary ingredients. The cherry tomatoes used here are datterini, a particularly intense variety grown on the estate. If you're unsure if your cherry tomatoes are up to the job, just taste one. If it's watery and bland, this recipe won't do anything to improve it. Better to move on to another recipe or else search out better tomatoes. The arugula used here is the perennial variety, which grows wild in Puglia. Tough and spicy, it adds both flavor and texture to the dish. Prewashed, bagged hothouse arugula may not have the same effect but will be close. SERVES 6

Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound of cavatelli or orecchiette 1/3 cup of extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 pound of cherry tomatoes 1/4 cup of fresh basil leaves 1 bunch of arugula or other spicy green, rinsed and dried 4 ounces of ricotta salata, grated (1 cup)

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions until al dente. In the meantime, pour the olive oil into a large frying pan (big enough to hold the drained pasta later). Add the cherry tomatoes, basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook over high heat for about 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have started to break down. Drain the pasta and add it to the tomatoes. Using the back of your spoon, smash the tomatoes to let their juices run out. Toss well to coat the pasta completely. Divide the pasta into six individual bowls. Scatter the arugula leaves and ricotta salata over the top. Drizzle with more olive oil and serve immediately.

Crucchi CHOCOLATE AND HAZELNUT BISCOTTI Crucchi belong to a category of rustic cookie that shows up all over Italy with slight variations depending on local ingredients. These not only use local hazelnuts but also chocolate, which turns them a dark, intense color. Don't expect a soft, chewy cookie. These are very hard, but also very addictive. They go perfectly with coffee at the end of a meal. MAKES 16 COOKIES

1 cup of toasted blanched hazelnuts (preferably halved) 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 11/2 cups of sugar Pinch of sea salt 2 large eggs

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. If your hazelnuts are whole, stick the point of a knife into a nut at the fat, dimpled end, and it should break in half fairly easily. Don't worry if the halves aren't perfectly even. If that seems too fussy, then just roughly chop them. Just don't chop too finely! Put the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix to combine. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them with a fork. Add the eggs to the flour mixture and mix with a spoon. The mixture will be very dry and stiff. Use your hands to finish mixing, adding the nuts at the end. Using your hands, form an irregular, raggedy mound of about a tablespoon of dough, and drop it onto the cookie sheet. Repeat with the rest of the dough, spacing the cookies about 1 inch apart. Bake for 20 minutes. It is hard to tell when they are done, since they are a deep, dark brown, but 20 minutes is usually good. Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. The cookies will be very hard on the outside and a little moist and chewy on the inside. If making them ahead, store them in an airtight container for up to a week.

Prologue (David Mor, Cindy's Rooftop, Chicago) .75oz Lillet Rose .75oz Luxardo Bitter Bianco .25oz Giffard Abricot du Roussillon .5oz hibiscus syrup .5oz yuzu juice Fever-Tree Aromatic Tonic Garnish: Frilled dianthus flower Vessel: Coupe Ice: n/a Method: Combine ingredients in cocktail shaker with ice, shake + strain into a coupe glass. Top with Fever-Tree Aromatic Tonic.

Inspiration from David Mor: ""The Fever-Tree Aromatic Tonic is pretty much unlike anything I have ever tasted; it is bitter while still floral and refreshing. It offers the notable flavors of Angostura bark while bringing up unknown flavors. I wanted to create a low-ABV aperitif that could be bittersweet, effervescent, and tropical. With flavors like yuzu, hibiscus, and apricot, the drink is balanced and acts as a perfect prologue to an experience.""","A Mother's Day bounty of tips from someone who's been sharing the joys of Italian food for decades.

369,Lucky Dumplings for Lunar New Year,Lilian Huang,"Dumplings you don't need to fly to Asia for! Top Chef alum Shirley Chung shares tips with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo on turning out the tastiest dumplings and other lucky Lunar New Year foods. Listen Here:

JIAOZI WITH CHICKEN FILLING

According to Chinese legend, jiaozi was invented thousands of years ago by an Emperor's doctor during a cold winter. That winter was so cold, lots of poor peoples' ears were falling off and many of them were getting sick. So, the doctor begged the Emperor to give him some flour, and then he went around collecting mutton trims from the rich families. The doctor made jiaozi dumplings folded in an ear shape and filled with mutton and herbal medicines, and then he fed the poor of the whole city. Jiaozi became a staple dish to make when guests come to visit, during the Chinese New Year celebration, when kids go back to visit mom . . . The Chinese show their love through these dumplings. Lots of people get intimidated by folding dumplings--don't be. They don't have to be perfect: just seal them with filling inside, or use a dumpling folder. Don't miss out on this deliciousness!

SERVES 4

Jiaozi Wrapper 4 cups (480 g) all-purpose flour 1¼ cups (300 ml) water 1 tsp salt

Chicken Filling 1 lb (450 g) ground chicken 4 tbsp (60 ml) oyster sauce 4 tbsp (60 ml) soy sauce 4 tbsp (60 ml) chicken stock 1 large egg 1 tbsp (15 ml) sesame oil 2 tbsp (14 g) minced ginger ½ cup (50 g) minced green onions

For Serving Black vinegar Chili oil

Tools to Help You Dough mixer Pasta roller 3-inch (8-cm) cookie cutter Dumpling folder

Jiaozi Wrapper Combine the flour, water and salt in a mixer. Knead until it forms a smooth dough, and rest it for 30 minutes. In my house, after the dough has rested, I will portion it into bottle cap-size balls (about 7 grams each), then individually roll them out into small rounds with a rolling pin to make wrappers. Alternatively, you can run the dough through a pasta roller. Roll them to #4 thickness, then use a 3-inch (8-cm) cookie cutter to cut out round wrappers.

Chicken Filling Put the ground chicken in a medium-size mixing bowl. Combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce and chicken stock together in a cup. Slowly pour this liquid into the ground chicken while stirring, until all the liquid absorbs into the meat. Next add the egg and sesame oil, and mix well. After all the seasoning is mixed into the chicken, add the ginger and green onions, and mix well. It's ready for folding.

Dumplings Using a dumpling folder, if you'd like, take 1 wrapper and 1 tablespoon (15 g) of chicken filling per dumpling. Place the filling in the middle of the wrapper, close the edges and make them into an ear shape (half- moon shape). After all the jiaozi are folded, boil water in a large pot. Add the jiaozi in when the water is boiling. When the water returns to a boil, add ½ cup (120 ml) of cold water, and bring back to a boil. When all the jiaozi are floating on top of the water, they are done. Enjoy them hot with some black vinegar and chili oil.

WHOLE STEAMED RED SNAPPER

Steamed whole fish is the staple of any Chinese celebration feast. Fish symbolize prosperity, luck and opportunities in our culture. My version is extra exciting, with bean sprouts tossed in and Doubanjiang to add texture and spice. The aged soy sauce brings in more umami, and the final pour of hot oil over the steamed fish will push the aroma to overdrive. You want to source the freshest fish to steam. Make sure the gills are bright red, the eyeballs are clear and the flesh bounces back when you press it. If a whole fish freaks you out a little bit, you can always steam a fish fillet; just drop the cooking time to 4 to 5 minutes. Don't worry, prosperity won't run away from you. Decode the special meaning behind this dish: Bean sprouts represent growth, and fish represents prosperity and wealth. Eat this dish, and you will grow your wealth.

SERVES 6

1½ lb (675 g) whole red snapper, cleaned, scaled and gutted Salt and white pepper, to taste 1 oz (28 g) bean sprouts 1 tsp Doubanjiang chili paste 1 tbsp (15 ml) Shaoxing wine 2 thinly sliced green onions, divided 1 tsp sesame oil 1 tbsp (7 g) thinly sliced ginger 1 red Fresno chili, thinly sliced, seeds removed 4 tbsp (60 ml) aged soy sauce (I like Wan Ja Shan brand) 4 tbsp (60 ml) canola oil

Tools Stainless steel or bamboo steamer that is big enough to fit the whole fish A large plate that fits in the steamer and holds the fish

Fill the bottom of the steamer with water and start boiling the water. Score the fish 3 times on each side for even cooking. Rub the inside and the outside of snapper with salt and pepper, and set aside.

In a small mixing bowl, toss the bean sprouts with the Doubanjiang, Shaoxing wine, 1 pinch of sliced green onions and the sesame oil, and season to taste with salt. Stuff the snapper with the seasoned bean sprouts. Place a few slices of ginger on the flesh of the fish, and place the fish on a plate for steaming. Steam the stuffed whole snapper over high heat in the steamer for 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, toss the sliced Fresno chili pepper and the rest of the green onions together. Heat up the soy sauce in a small saucepan, simmer for 1 minute and turn of the heat. This cooked soy sauce is part of the sauce for the steamed fish.

When the fish is finished steaming, take it out of the steamer an d place on a serving dish. Drizzle the soy sauce all over the fish, and place an even layer of green onions and Fresno chili on the steamed fish. In a small sauté pan, heat up the cooking oil until smoking hot and then pour the hot oil over the green onions on the fish. You can smell the caramelized soy sauce and onion aroma.

Full Transcript:

Guy Benson: Back on The Guy Benson Show. Thank you for listening on this Thursday. Beautiful day here in New York City I am very pleased to welcome back to the program Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Senator great to talk to you again. Thanks for being here.

Sen. Rubio: Thank you. Hey thanks for having me back.

Guy Benson: My pleasure. I want to start you've got an op ed at FOX News.com today. You write Warren's economic patriotism plan is simply not possible with a progressive agenda. This coming on the heels of what you put out you're calling it an investment report. What's your argument.

Sen. Rubio: Well my argument is you know I actually give her credit. She's the first Democrat to kind of lay out the argument that American economic policy should put American workers and American businesses first. I think where she's going to have big troubles is that what it's going to take to actually do that is going to run smack into the demands of the progressive radical radical progressive that dominate the party and she's trying to become the nominee. They demand cultural warfare. They demand the demonization of corporations writ large. They demand all sorts of things that they're putting the sort of the things that matter to upper middle class people living in the coastal areas of the country and in the pockets of prosperity that they demand that those things be put in front of the sort of hard choices that need to be made to reorient our policy. And frankly if she decides that she wants to have a policy that achieves what she's talking about she's not going to have a home and Democratic Party. And then there's the. That's not what they want from their nominee.

Guy Benson: What are those hard choices that need to be made in terms of reorienting policy.

Sen. Rubio: Well I think at first it begins by recognizing that you can't have a healthy economy with high paying jobs without companies and corporations that are doing well. And look I've beat up on big corporations because I don't always believe that they have. In fact I don't think they have American interests at heart and most of the time that I was I was reading an article yesterday about these big companies or leading boycotts and all sorts of social activism these are the same companies who are on the other hand asked us not to put sanctions on China or they want us to lift sanctions on Russia. They want us to get back into the JCP away so they can do business in Iran so that they think we're very tolerant of dictators and authoritarians all over the world but are prepared to boycott states because they don't like some law passed by the democratically elected legislature of that state. So you know I beat him up pretty good on the same token. You know we do need business in America. We also need a lot of small businesses and we need them both. And some of the key things we need success for in our country cannot be achieved if we have a climate that's negative to these companies. The other choices that have to be made frankly would have us to take on some of the orthodoxy in the Republican Party and that includes this notion that everything now we've become a party almost dominated by the needs of the financial markets the financial markets the stock market Wall Street investor class they're an important part of the economy but they are not the economy. And so what you end up happening is you have corporations today who basically feel like their number one objective is to return value the shareholders and as a result many are not are committing corporate suicide in the long term they're not investing. And that has an economic implications for this country. More and more of this indefinite investment deteriorates the likelier it is that the great innovation the great companies the great industries of the 21st century are going to be located somewhere else but not in America and not for Americans.

Guy Benson: If listeners want to read more they can go to FOX News.com and take a look at what Senator Rubio wrote today in his column. I want to go overseas senator and talk about the latest coming out of Venezuela. It's of course a topic that you've been covering extremely closely. Very personal to you. Are the Russians it seems have pulled out or at least have stopped some of their efforts to prop up the Maduro regime. What's the very latest in Venezuela. Are there new glimmers of hope for people who support the opposition which the U.S. government I think has rightly identified and recognized as the legitimate interim government.

Sen. Rubio: I don't think the Russians have any loyalty or affinity for Maduro as an individual. I think two things. Number one is they find this as an opportunity to play spoiler to basically undermine American foreign policy priority and number two to project power internationally to show people hey we're Russia. We can even play in the Western Hemisphere. And Putin has sort of perfected the art of being able to have high yield low cost engagements in places like Syria to some extent but most certainly and Ukraine and here and Venezuela to sort of put out this message that helps him domestically to that hey Russia is a great power again on par with the United States. And so I think that's what their interests are there as far as Maduro is concerned. Here's the bottom line. OK. All this talk about how Maduro is poverty or doesn't control Venezuela he didn't govern Venezuela. He has control over its repressive apparatus. I can assure you of this this I can tell you with 100 percent certainty every single he individual and his regime around him knows that he is going to fall and that he needs to go. What is happening now is both open and secret jockeying to be the person that succeeds and that's the problem. The problem is not getting rid of Maduro. The problem is whether he's replaced by democracy or by someone else under the same system. Maybe a little bit less anti- American at least openly but not a democracy. That's the bigger challenge here.

Guy Benson: Why do you think just going back to the Russian point because there were these reports that some of their assets were being pulled back. Why do you think they did that was that some sort of concession to Oscar. What changed.

Sen. Rubio: No. Yeah I think what's changed is twofold. One they're not getting paid. I mean the Maduro regime doesn't pay its bills. They just defaulted again this week on another loan and lost 20 tons of gold which they had used as collateral. So that's the first the second think the Russians don't have any respect for them they find them to be incompetent to find to be corrupt and for the Russians to say he's corrupt just tells you the level of corruption you're talking about. And the third is some of these are private companies that were sent in to do work on a project taking you get this radar site to work again. So they went in and got it up an operative and now that work is done and now they've got to figure out how to leave and without appearing to be abandoning the guy. So you know that that's part of this as well. But it looked at the Russian effort there. Did they fully recognize him Maduro as they would cut him loose tomorrow if they feel if they felt it was an opportunity to replace him with somebody who was not pro-American and could allow them to say that they thwarted an American priority and that's what's happening right now. And that's what they're and others are actively engaged in sort of figuring out who to replace Maduro with. They'll find somebody out there you're one of these governors from the government from party who is less moderate or somehow and. But it'll be a figurehead or be a puppet. And the real power will remain in the hands of the corrupt people. This is not a government that Maduro regime is an organized crime ring. And the reason why they're fighting to stay in power is not ideology it's because they have made millions and millions of dollars from corruption graft and theft and they don't want to lose that. And they most certainly don't want to go to jail for it.

Guy Benson: Senator on another international matter you've been talking a lot writing a lot about China as an adversary across the globe. Senator Romney just gave his maiden floor speech. A lot of it focused on China as well. What do you see as the important the important dynamics of the U.S. China relationship that you think Americans need to know about. And as the president and his team are trying to hammer out some sort of a deal a better deal with the Chinese. What would a better deal in your mind look like what must it entail.

Sen. Rubio: Balance both geo political economic and otherwise the military. There has to be balance and some level of symmetry and that's not where we're headed right now. We have treated China as a poor developing country and a lot of to cheat and steal for a long time under the assumption that once they got rich they would become like us. We finally figured out it took too long. But that wasn't the case. And now we're trying to make up for lost ground. And right now we're headed to a very imbalanced relationship where more and more of the high end of the economy is headed in their direction and away from us. And because they've stolen the technology or frankly because they've put our companies or western companies out of business through unfair practices. So the first begins with balance. The second is alliances. You know the one thing China is not good at is alliances. And so one of the things that balances out the world is strong alliances with our European allies strong alliances with India and Australia and Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. And with these alliances I mean as you know that this notion that America dominated the world is not true we're the most powerful country in the world. But for much of the period after the Second World War you know we see a block what would allow the Cold War to go in our direction was that we got very strong alliances with the free world and that ultimately communism collapsed that more of those countries have fallen into the Soviet or history might have been very different. And so I think it's a combination and of course you know the strong domestic capacity if we lose the great industries of the 21st century are not located in the West and particularly in the United States they're located in China they will get to set the terms for what the 21st century looks like and it's not going to be a democratic one. It's not going to be one that respects the individual rights and freedoms and liberties that that's what will happen to the most powerful country in the world. Totalitarian regime like the Chinese regime.

Guy Benson: Senator Rubio you mentioned alliances there one of our allies and certainly a top trading partner is Mexico. A number of your Republican colleagues have come out against the president's gambit here on tariffs and tying that to immigration policy you have come out sat seemingly kind of reluctantly in favor of what the president's doing. Are you concerned at all about endorsing a precedent of a United States president using punitive tariffs and effective tax increases on Americans to try to achieve sort of a separate foreign policy or domestic policy outcome.

Sen. Rubio: Yeah look I'd prefer that that wouldn't have happened because I'm not a person by writ large I'm not I'm not a tariff fan and I think you try to avoid them I don't I don't like them as a matter of policy. I do think sometimes they're necessary either in order to protect herself or in this case as a matter of leverage and if there is a better way to get Mexico to do things that are not unreasonable like no one can you monitor you know they have a much narrower border than we do. Can you monitor what's inside the trucks and rail cars headed north. No. You can you can you build some physical structures to make it harder for people to cross over from the Guatemalan border. Will you act out when we give you actionable intelligence that says here's what the trafficking network is going to do tomorrow. Can you stop them and arrest them. Will you actually go and do it. I don't know how else to get them to do it. I mean we've tried every carrot that we have to get them to do that and it hasn't happened. And so the president says this is the one I've got I've got to use this stick. It's the only one I have that actually works. And if someone has a better one I'm for it. I just. No one's come up with a better one that gets them to the table you know and at least they're at the table now. But you know it's frustrating to read just yesterday a thousand migrants and the AP the Associated Press had a reporter there saw a thousand migrants come across the border headed towards the United States escorted along the way and facilitated by Mexican state and local police officers. I mean it's they are you know they're encouraging this when they do that and we're paying a tremendous price here domestically having to reassign federal agents away from other critical obligations to have to continue to reinforce the border to deal with this humanitarian crisis down there.

Guy Benson: Last question Senator Rubio it's on American politics some of the domestic fighting that goes on here Nancy Pelosi speaker of the house now widely reported according to many sources last night during a closed door meeting of top Democrats they were arguing about impeachment and she reportedly told Jerry Nadler speaking of the president quote I don't want to see him impeached. I want to see him in prison. I wonder what you make of that comment from the Speaker.

Sen. Rubio: Well again I didn't hear her say it but I'm going to assume it's acted on its own. She denied saying that. I think two things are happening. The first is you can see the pressure she's under for impeachment I mean there are people in Congress who spend 90 percent of their time figuring out how can we get rid of the president and not figuring out how we can move the country forward not figuring out how can we win the election and 20 you know a 20. They spend their whole time with this notion of how can we get them removed from office. And it's an unhealthy obsession. And and obviously she's got a lot of pressure on her and she needs to sort of not in our direction. This is what I mean by a Democrat. This is what I meant when we start out this interview about radical progressives who demand they're demanding these cultural fights. They're demanding these sorts of things. They're demanding a certain public policy to grow our economy or take on China. They are demanding this. This is what they spend 90 percent of their time on. That's what I make of it. And so I imagine that's her best effort to sort of appease them. But you know it's it's obvious it's troubling because this you know she controls the House of Representatives and I think it's pretty clear what direction they're headed here and that is they're not trying to offer counter policies that they're they're looking to destroy the prison United States they want. I understand they don't agree with his policies. That's why we have elections every four years.

Guy Benson: Back on The Guy Benson Show. Thank you for listening on this Thursday. Beautiful day here in New York City I am very pleased to welcome back to the program Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Senator great to talk to you again. Thanks for being here.

Sen. Rubio: Thank you. Hey thanks for having me back.

Guy Benson: My pleasure. I want to start you've got an op ed at FOX News.com today. You write Warren's economic patriotism plan is simply not possible with a progressive agenda. This coming on the heels of what you put out you're calling it an investment report. What's your argument.

Sen. Rubio: Well my argument is you know I actually give her credit. She's the first Democrat to kind of lay out the argument that American economic policy should put American workers and American businesses first. I think where she's going to have big troubles is that what it's going to take to actually do that is going to run smack into the demands of the progressive radical radical progressive that dominate the party and she's trying to become the nominee. They demand cultural warfare. They demand the demonization of corporations writ large. They demand all sorts of things that they're putting the sort of the things that matter to upper middle class people living in the coastal areas of the country and in the pockets of prosperity that they demand that those things be put in front of the sort of hard choices that need to be made to reorient our policy. And frankly if she decides that she wants to have a policy that achieves what she's talking about she's not going to have a home and Democratic Party. And then there's the. That's not what they want from their nominee.

Guy Benson: What are those hard choices that need to be made in terms of reorienting policy.

Sen. Rubio: Well I think at first it begins by recognizing that you can't have a healthy economy with high paying jobs without companies and corporations that are doing well. And look I've beat up on big corporations because I don't always believe that they have. In fact I don't think they have American interests at heart and most of the time that I was I was reading an article yesterday about these big companies or leading boycotts and all sorts of social activism these are the same companies who are on the other hand asked us not to put sanctions on China or they want us to lift sanctions on Russia. They want us to get back into the JCP away so they can do business in Iran so that they think we're very tolerant of dictators and authoritarians all over the world but are prepared to boycott states because they don't like some law passed by the democratically elected legislature of that state. So you know I beat him up pretty good on the same token. You know we do need business in America. We also need a lot of small businesses and we need them both. And some of the key things we need success for in our country cannot be achieved if we have a climate that's negative to these companies. The other choices that have to be made frankly would have us to take on some of the orthodoxy in the Republican Party and that includes this notion that everything now we've become a party almost dominated by the needs of the financial markets the financial markets the stock market Wall Street investor class they're an important part of the economy but they are not the economy. And so what you end up happening is you have corporations today who basically feel like their number one objective is to return value the shareholders and as a result many are not are committing corporate suicide in the long term they're not investing. And that has an economic implications for this country. More and more of this indefinite investment deteriorates the likelier it is that the great innovation the great companies the great industries of the 21st century are going to be located somewhere else but not in America and not for Americans.

Guy Benson: If listeners want to read more they can go to FOX News.com and take a look at what Senator Rubio wrote today in his column. I want to go overseas senator and talk about the latest coming out of Venezuela. It's of course a topic that you've been covering extremely closely. Very personal to you. Are the Russians it seems have pulled out or at least have stopped some of their efforts to prop up the Maduro regime. What's the very latest in Venezuela. Are there new glimmers of hope for people who support the opposition which the U.S. government I think has rightly identified and recognized as the legitimate interim government.

Sen. Rubio: I don't think the Russians have any loyalty or affinity for Maduro as an individual. I think two things. Number one is they find this as an opportunity to play spoiler to basically undermine American foreign policy priority and number two to project power internationally to show people hey we're Russia. We can even play in the Western Hemisphere. And Putin has sort of perfected the art of being able to have high yield low cost engagements in places like Syria to some extent but most certainly and Ukraine and here and Venezuela to sort of put out this message that helps him domestically to that hey Russia is a great power again on par with the United States. And so I think that's what their interests are there as far as Maduro is concerned. Here's the bottom line. OK. All this talk about how Maduro is poverty or doesn't control Venezuela he didn't govern Venezuela. He has control over its repressive apparatus. I can assure you of this this I can tell you with 100 percent certainty every single he individual and his regime around him knows that he is going to fall and that he needs to go. What is happening now is both open and secret jockeying to be the person that succeeds and that's the problem. The problem is not getting rid of Maduro. The problem is whether he's replaced by democracy or by someone else under the same system. Maybe a little bit less anti- American at least openly but not a democracy. That's the bigger challenge here.

Guy Benson: Why do you think just going back to the Russian point because there were these reports that some of their assets were being pulled back. Why do you think they did that was that some sort of concession to Oscar. What changed.

Sen. Rubio: No. Yeah I think what's changed is twofold. One they're not getting paid. I mean the Maduro regime doesn't pay its bills. They just defaulted again this week on another loan and lost 20 tons of gold which they had used as collateral. So that's the first the second think the Russians don't have any respect for them they find them to be incompetent to find to be corrupt and for the Russians to say he's corrupt just tells you the level of corruption you're talking about. And the third is some of these are private companies that were sent in to do work on a project taking you get this radar site to work again. So they went in and got it up an operative and now that work is done and now they've got to figure out how to leave and without appearing to be abandoning the guy. So you know that that's part of this as well. But it looked at the Russian effort there. Did they fully recognize him Maduro as they would cut him loose tomorrow if they feel if they felt it was an opportunity to replace him with somebody who was not pro-American and could allow them to say that they thwarted an American priority and that's what's happening right now.

David Curry is the founder and CEO of Open Doors USA, which monitors religious persecution around the world. China, he says is a growing concern. In the thirty years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, Christianity has grown by leaps and bounds, with some experts saying until the latest government crackdown, was on pace to become the largest Christian population in the world. And that's why the Communist Government is running scared, trying to keep the followers of Jesus under Communist control by monitoring, making lists and using technology to watch their every movement. Meanwhile the persecution is rampant elsewhere too; in India, Nigeria, and all parts of the Middle East. David Curry gives an update on the dire human reality of religious persecution.

Listen here:



Email

Guy Benson [00:00:00] Joined now by the majority leader of the U.S. Senate Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky Senator great to see you again.

Sen. McConnell [00:00:06] Good to be with you. So last time we sat face to face my very first question was may I call you cocaine Mitch. You said yes but you've now accumulated some more nicknames since then there's nuclear Mitch you've been called the Grim Reaper which makes you almost sound like a villain in professional wrestling. I'm wondering what you make of this new this new image that you have the Democrats saying that you're presiding over a legislative graveyard. Have you leaned into any of these nicknames you have one that you have.

Sen. McConnell [00:00:36] This is not a recent development I've called myself Darth Vader. Back during the campaign finance wars and so I've kind of enjoyed playing off of my enemies over the years. And in fact the Grim Reaper Title I gave myself and I was in a in an appearance in which I was pointing out that the Democrats now you know fully embrace socialism and as long as I was the majority leader of the Senate I'd be the Grim Reaper and we wouldn't be passing anything like the Green New Deal or Medicare for all. And that was the firewall against socialism in this country.

Guy Benson [00:01:14] Interesting that you came up with the nickname and they've sort of gone with it. Yeah he did. He's leading even on his own nicknames.

Sen. McConnell [00:01:19] Happy to embrace it.

Guy Benson [00:01:21] So let's talk about something you said last week caused a bit of a stir. You were asked a question what would happen if there were a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020. You said the Republican majority would fill that vacancy. Everyone started pointing out that in 2016 you defended blocking or stonewalling President Obama's nomination Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia. Your argument was it's a presidential year. The American people should be able to vote Choose the next president then the Senate would consider a nominee. Now there's President Trump a Republican in office. Some of your critics are saying you've completely reversed yourself. How do you respond to the hypocrisy charge and are there some meaningful factors or differences that would make 2020 different.

Sen. McConnell [00:02:03] It reminds me of when they became agitated when I said I wanted to make Barack Obama a one term president. They conveniently left out the rest of what I said because he had two years left in his first term and as in the meantime there are things we need to tackle on a bipartisan basis to get the country headed in a better direction. And the only major reporter in town who covered the rest of it was Bob Woodward which I always appreciate it. So here they're conveniently cherry picking what I said in 2016 what I pointed out was that you'd have to go back to the eighteen eighties to find the last time a Senate controlled by a different party than the president filled a vacancy on the Supreme Court created in the middle of a presidential election I said it then. I've said it repeatedly and I was shocked that this seemed like news. And next year there will be a Republican Senate and a Republican president. I have no idea whether there will be a Supreme Court vacancy knowing how the left of center members of the Supreme Court feel about The President of The United States. I think it would take a significant life ending event to create such a vacancy but I would do the same thing Joe Biden said in 1992 Democratic Senate Republican president he said he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee said if their vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it. I would be consistent with what Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid said 18 months before the end of Bush 43 years eight years when they said of a vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill up 18 months before the end of the term. So yeah we would fill a vacancy that occurred. I don't expect it to but if it occurred yes we would go forward.

Guy Benson [00:04:00] So the difference is the party control?

Sen. McConnell [00:04:03] Yeah because the Constitution is quite clear that only the president doesn't have an exclusive on Supreme Court appointments. There are two roles he gets to pick. We get to decide whether to go forward. We have every bit a right to assert ourselves as he does to assert himself. And so we have a constitutional role. It's been there since the Constitution was written and we would fully exercise it next year.

Guy Benson [00:04:33] I think the judiciary and the reshaping of the federal judiciary is in my view. I don't wanna be presumptuous but I think it's your legacy and your reputation for a long time here in town was one of a cautious institutionalist. But you've become I think increasingly bold when it comes to this particular issue. My questions are was there a moment in these battles that you decided that the Republicans needed to match the Democrats hardball approach to confirmations and relatedly, were you surprised when your counterpart Senator Schumer and his caucus decided to filibuster Neil Gorsuch speech rather than maybe waiting for a potentially higher stakes vacancy to play that card.

Sen. McConnell [00:05:19] With regard to your last observation. I think that probably was a tactical mistake. He didn't have the courage to stand up to his left and so this is probably not the best time to filibuster a well qualified Supreme Court justice. Had they not done that we would not have needed to lower the threshold and I would remind your listeners that was the Democrats in 2013 who lowered the threshold from 60 to 51 to fill judicial vacancies. The Democrats did. They only left out one Supreme Court and.

Guy Benson [00:05:53] Was at the moment the 2013 nuclear option from Senator Reid where you sit where did they go. Did that change the game for you?

Sen. McConnell [00:05:59] From what I said to myself was OK I don't like the way they did it but all they did was take us back to the way the executive calendar you know the senators on the personnel business for twelve hundred executive branch appointments that come to us for confirmation the most important are judges until the year 2000. No judge was ever defeated with a filibuster until the year 2000 when George W. Bush was elected. No cabinet member ever been defeated by a filibuster. This is a recent invention and the guy who started it was Chuck Schumer so it was kind of fun to watch him squirm frankly because he started this whole battle and we ended it and right now where we are Guy is we're back where we were until Bush 43 got elected executive counter's done with a simple majority and I think it's the right thing for the institution and it's I'm sure it will benefit them you know.

Guy Benson [00:07:00] Numerous Democrats running for president are talking about changing the Supreme Court adding justices packing the court bringing the number up to 15 is one of the proposals I saw. What do you make of that?

Sen. McConnell [00:07:11] I think they are genuine threat. I think this is another thing in addition at times like the Green New Deal and Medicare for all that they will do the next time they get a handle. It's important to remind people that the number of Supreme Court justices is set by statute. The last time it changed was 1869. So that could be done by a simple statute on oh by the way they plan to make D.C. a state and Puerto Rico a state that's four new Democratic senators they plan long term to take over this government take us far to the left and turn us into a socialist country. They've got to be stopped. And that's why I call myself the Grim Reaper. As long as I'm in charge of the Senate it's always on the majority leader of the Senate this stuff is not going to pass.

Guy Benson [00:07:54] Well let's talk about the Senate calendar and what may or may not get votes. Just yesterday House Democrats took a brief hiatus from their bickering over impeachment. They actually passed something which is this dream act on immigration. It was a standalone DREAM Act. Will that bill get a vote in the U.S. Senate as written?

Sen. McConnell [00:08:14] Probably not. Immigration is an area that there is bipartisan responsibility for failure to act. I think it's important to remember when the Democrats lost control the entire government the White House the House the Senate 2009, 2010 no brought the subject up. So makes me wonder if they really want an outcome or they want an issue. I think the dreamers have a sympathetic case. There are circumstances under which I and others would be happy to support that. But we need to do more than that. You know there's some genuine fixes on the legal immigration side and on the illegal immigration side that need to be addressed.

Guy Benson [00:08:54] So you'd want the Dream Act paired with.

Sen. McConnell [00:08:56] I would. I would. I think there is a perfectly legitimate case for the DREAMERS. These are your listeners or the kids who were brought here by their parents who've been raised as Americans and deserve to be Americans at some point. But I think we need to do more than just that. And that's the context in which I would deal with that issue in the Senate.

Guy Benson [00:09:17] You spoke this morning on the floor about another immigration issue the ongoing crisis at the border are broken asylum status quo. Senator Graham has a bill on this. Do you get a sense that there's any bipartisan thrust to actually fix the problem and do you expect Graham's bill or someone's bill to come to the floor for a vote.

Sen. McConnell [00:09:38] Well the first thing we need to do is deal with the humanitarian crisis here you have the New York Times editorial page. And Donald Trump on the same side. We've got a humanitarian.

Guy Benson [00:09:50] That's very rare.

Sen. McConnell [00:09:51] Yeah. Believe it or not there are headlines that give Trump the money they're talking about this rush of folks coming to the border that we don't have the capacity to take care of the short term problem that needs to be addressed through a supplemental appropriation. They strip that part out of the supplemental that we passed just last week to deal with storms in Puerto Rico and Florida Georgia and Alabama Nebraska and Iowa. That would've been a logical place to add this humanitarian relief. What Lindsay is trying to do is to get some legal challenges that we absolutely need to make. I hope he can get some Democratic support in committee and if he can put something together on a bipartisan basis that helps us solve the legal problems we're confronted with. That's just how long can you detain people. That would be a good subject to bring up.

Guy Benson [00:10:48] President's now linking the border crisis with trade policy threatening tariffs on Mexico. There are reports that there might be an emerging bipartisan veto proof majority to undo those tariffs should they be implemented based on what you're seeing from your caucus. Is that true?

Sen. McConnell [00:11:06] Let me just say there is a lack of enthusiasm among Senate Republicans for what would amount to a tax increase frankly on working class people. I mean drives up the cost of goods that you would be purchasing at Walmart other places. So I'm hoping this can be avoided. There's a Mexican delegation in town as you and I are speaking trying to see if they can reach some agreement to do a better job of keeping folks most of these people who were coming up or coming from Central America not from Mexico and they're traversing the entire of Mexico that the Mexicans could do a better job of preventing them from crossing the border in the southern part of Mexico and also try to enhance their effort on the border. Maybe all of this can be averted.

Guy Benson [00:11:53] Last question House Democrats appear poised to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt possibly next week. What is your assessment of the Democrats treatment of the attorney general and your assessment of the job he's doing.

Sen. McConnell [00:12:06] I think the attorney general is doing a great job. The Democrats just can't let it go. You know the case is closed. The only objective investigation with the Mueller Report. You know the public knows there's not going to be an objective investigation in Congress. Each side will try to politicize it. They need to let it go. I mean I think that the reason the speaker is so reluctant to see them go down the impeachment path is that the American people are not interested in it. If you've got a grievance with Donald Trump you've got a vote coming up next year. Why would we need to in effect veto the election the American people conducted in 2016 that legitimately elected it.

Guy Benson [00:12:49] Senator McConnell thank you so much for your time.

Sen. McConnell [00:12:51] Thank you.","You were asked a question what would happen if there were a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020.

Listen here:



Email

Guy Benson [00:00:00] Joined now by the majority leader of the U.S. Senate Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky Senator great to see you again.

Sen. McConnell [00:00:06] Good to be with you. So last time we sat face to face my very first question was may I call you cocaine Mitch. You said yes but you've now accumulated some more nicknames since then there's nuclear Mitch you've been called the Grim Reaper which makes you almost sound like a villain in professional wrestling. I'm wondering what you make of this new this new image that you have the Democrats saying that you're presiding over a legislative graveyard. Have you leaned into any of these nicknames you have one that you have.

Sen. McConnell [00:00:36] This is not a recent development I've called myself Darth Vader. Back during the campaign finance wars and so I've kind of enjoyed playing off of my enemies over the years. And in fact the Grim Reaper Title I gave myself and I was in a in an appearance in which I was pointing out that the Democrats now you know fully embrace socialism and as long as I was the majority leader of the Senate I'd be the Grim Reaper and we wouldn't be passing anything like the Green New Deal or Medicare for all. And that was the firewall against socialism in this country.

Guy Benson [00:01:14] Interesting that you came up with the nickname and they've sort of gone with it. Yeah he did. He's leading even on his own nicknames.

Sen. McConnell [00:01:19] Happy to embrace it.

386,Congressman Michael Burgess: If The Senate Does Not Like President Trump Using His Authority To Impose Tariffs On Mexico Then They Should Get To Work On Addressing The Border Crisis,Peter Caterina,"Congressman Michael Burgess (R-TX) spoke with Brian Kilmeade about his opposition to bill H.R. 6, the Democrats' self-titled DACA fix, which passed the in House. Burgess says the bill does nothing to address the border crisis and give proper funding to the border patrol. He believes House Democrats refuse to budge on the border because they do not want to give President Trump a legislative victory. Burgess supports President Trump using tariffs on Mexico as a tool to stop the flow of illegals across the border. Burgess understands why his fellow Texan, Senator Ted Cruz, and other senators are not in favor of the tariffs but feels if the Senate does not like the President using his powers to impose the tariff then they should get to work on fixing the crisis at the border.

390,Greg Gutfeld: Biden is 'toast' after latest campaign hiccup,Victor Garcia,"Are former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential hopes 'toast'?

""The Five"" discussed Biden's ""flip-flop"" Friday on the Hyde Amendment, and co-host Greg Gutfeld voiced his thoughts, saying this latest hiccup may push the Democratic presidential frontrunner ""out the door.""

""I think he is actually toast, I really do, I think that this is going to push him out the door. The more people see of him the less they like him,"" Gutfeld said.

BIDEN'S EVOLUTION: PRESSURE FROM LEFT HAS DEM FRONT-RUNNER SHIFTING ON ABORTION AND MORE

Biden reversed course on the Hyde Amendment, telling his supporters: ""Health care is a right. I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's zip code.""

The Hyde Amendment, named for former Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion procedures except in special cases like saving the life of the mother.

A report in The Atlantic magazine claims Biden's campaign staff successfully convinced him to change his position.

Also in the report, activist and actress Alyssa Milano spoke to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz over the phone, urging him to have the former Delaware senator change.
