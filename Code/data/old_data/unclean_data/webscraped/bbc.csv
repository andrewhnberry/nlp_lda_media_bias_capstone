4,Everest through the eyes of a Sherpa: 'Climbers need to wake up’,Pradeep Bashyal,"Image copyright AFP / Seven Summit Treks Image caption Kami Rita Sherpa broke his own record not just once, but twice after summiting Everest for a 24th time

At least 11 people have died trying to climb Mount Everest this year. Kami Rita Sherpa, who's been to the world's highest summit more times than anyone else, tells the BBC too many climbers are led to believe Everest is easy.

On 13 May, exhausted and struggling to breathe, Yunfei Wang, a Chinese climber in her early 30s, staggered into Camp 3. At 7,162m (23,500ft) it was higher than she had ever climbed before. But the expedition was not going to plan and her dream of scaling Everest was slipping away.

Helping Yunfei with her oxygen mask was the group's leader, Kami Rita Sherpa. Not just any mountain guide, but the world-record holder for summiting Everest - he notched up his 24th ascent to the summit later that month.

""I always try to make sure every client succeeds to the summit,"" says Kami. ""But there is a line. The moment I realise that any of my clients will not make it, I will abort the mission.""

Image caption The Everest Southeast Ridge route, Nepal

Even from the outset, Kami saw that Yunfei was struggling. Days earlier, she took 19 hours, twice the expected time, to trek from Base Camp to Camp 2. When she finally arrived, Kami made the decision she simply wasn't ready for the summit and had her flown back down to Kathmandu by helicopter.

Rejoining the group a few days later, setting off from Base Camp, things started well. But by 6,000m, Yunfei was already heavily reliant on supplementary oxygen, a resource normally reserved for altitudes of 7,000m and above. By the time they arrived at Camp 3, Kami had made up his mind. The risk was too great - he ordered her to be taken back down the mountain to safety.

""There is always a risk of avalanche and above Camp 3 the path is steep and treacherous,"" says Kami. If in doubt, descent is always the best decision, because Everest will always be there if you survive.""

Everest is always dangerous. But this season, the death toll has been the highest for four years.

Overcrowding, bad weather and a record number of permits being issued may all be contributing factors. But Kami believes it's an increase in the number of less experienced climbers, like Yunfei, that are making the problem worse. He blames some tour companies for underestimating the risks to novice climbers.

""Overcrowding is nothing new. This is not the reason people are dying. It's pressure on young climbers by some companies describing Everest as easy. Everest is never easy.""

Image copyright AFP PHOTO / PROJECT POSSIBLE Image caption Last month this photo of two rows of climbers simultaneously ascending and descending close to Everest's summit went viral

Many veteran climbers, such as expert mountaineer and writer Alan Arnette, have also warned of the risks of tourists with little or no training attempting to scale huge peaks such as Everest.

""Climbers need to wake up and understand that climbing a big peak like Everest is extremely risky. They need to stop believing just because they are with a 'Sherpa guide' who has summited Everest 10 times that they will be rescued if they get in trouble,"" says Alan.

""Even the strongest Sherpa cannot take an incapacitated person lower by themselves or expect extra oxygen to be delivered to 8,400m at a moment's notice. And helicopters have their limits, as do rescue policies and GPS devices.""

Towering 8,848m above sea level, Mount Everest is the most famous mountain in the world. Located on the Nepal-Tibet border, this global beacon of exploration and endeavour lures hundreds of climbers every year.

But as Kami says: ""Without a Sherpa, there is no expedition.""

Descended from Tibetan heritage, the Sherpa community are an ethnic group, indigenous to the Himalayan region. But for many outside Nepal, the word ""Sherpa"" has become synonymous with those working as mountain guides.

Image caption Kami Rita returns home after his 24th Everest ascent in 25 years

Mostly young men, Sherpa guides are not just the muscle behind any expedition - carrying extra gear such as oxygen bottles, water and food - they are also expert navigators. Enduring freezing temperatures of -30C down to -50C, they help climbers to negotiate icefalls, avalanches and extreme altitude.

From Camp 4 up to the summit, climbers will enter what is commonly known as the ""death zone"". Operating above 8,000m, 95% of climbers will rely on supplementary oxygen carried in bottles. Sherpas must ensure their clients conserve their oxygen supply for the return journey.

""I keep checking everyone's oxygen levels, and in the event of extreme weather, I make strategic decisions about whether we ascend or descend to avoid any developing situations in the mountains,"" explains Kami.

Working as a mountain guide since 1992, last month Kami broke his own world record not just once, but twice. On 15 May, he reached the summit with 15 clients from China, before returning on 21 May with a second group of 11 climbers from India.

""I treat every climb with the same sincerity as the first,"" says Kami. ""Whenever a client is successful, it makes my day. I believe breaking records is just a by-product.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mountaineers close to Camp 2 prepare to ascend to Camp 3

Although the climbing season is short, often only a single week in mid-May, Sherpas look after the mountain for a total of three months. As well as fixing ropes and ladders before climbers arrive, they also undertake a huge clean-up operation, clearing the tonnes of rubbish left behind on the mountain.

In the language of Tibet, Mount Everest is known as Chomolungma, meaning goddess mother of the world. Many Sherpas believe that the summit of Chomolungma is home to the Buddhist goddess Miyolangsangma. It was she, they say, who allowed the first explorers, Sherpa Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, to reach the top in 1953.

For the Sherpa community, the mountain is not just a mass of rock, but a deity to be revered and cared for.

""We worship and have deep respect for the mountain,"" says Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, who has reached the summit eight times. ""We trust it will save us from whatever comes.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Discarded climbing equipment and rubbish left scattered at Camp 4

Kami grew up in the same mountain village as Tenzing Norgay. Thame is just 20km (13 miles) from Everest Base Camp, and the colossal Himalayan mountain range influenced many aspects of his childhood. Just getting to school meant a four-hour trek and put young Kami's climbing skills to the test.

Life was hard. The area is far from major towns, food was often scarce and healthcare almost non-existent.

To earn extra money, aged just 10, Kami dropped out of school and began trekking with his elders up peaks exceeding 3,000m. In the evenings he'd listen to their stories, tales of the mountain passed down through generations of Sherpas.

""I wanted to be a monk and spent five years training at a nearby monastery,"" says Kami, ""but how could I look for inner peace when back home the lives of my parents hung in the balance? There was no option but to return to climbing.""

Image caption The village of Thame is far from the nearest town and services

Image caption Teenagers working as porters carry heavy loads up to Everest Base Camp

Still today, almost every household in Thame depends on the passing trade from visiting climbers; running lodges, transporting supplies back and forth on yaks and ponies, or working up at Everest Base Camp as a porter or cook.

However, it's the Sherpas who guide foreign climbers all the way to the summit who make the most money, bringing home between $5,000 (£3,960) to $8,000 (£6,330) in a single season.

In 1992, aged 22, Kami began working as a kitchen porter at Base Camp. Luckily for Kami, his older brother Lakpa was also working on the mountain as a guide taking climbers up to the summit.

Image copyright Kami Rita Image caption Brothers Lakpa (R) and Kami Rita (L) host a visiting film-maker (C)

For the next two years, Lakpa took Kami under his wing, pushing him through rigorous high-altitude training and getting him work guiding small groups out on short trips to help them acclimatise. Then in 1994, Kami finally got his first shot at the top.

The night before the final push to the summit, Kami remembers being too anxious to sleep. Instead, he thought about what his fellow Sherpas had advised: ""Just pray for good weather!""

The following day under clear skies, both Kami and his client made their first ascent to the top.

""In that moment, my happiness was not about my first summit, but that my life would now be easier. With the summit of Everest on my resume, I would get more work.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sherpas and climbers standing on the summit of Everest

Since Kami Rita's first ascent in the mid-1990s, technologies such as weather prediction systems, helicopters, climbing gear and satellite communications have all revolutionised the adventure industry. But rather than alleviating the demands on them, Sherpas say they have only increased.

With growing numbers of aspiring climbers arriving year upon year, more mountain guides are needed than ever before. This year 381 climbing permits were issued on the Nepal side, the highest since records began in 1953.

Tour companies charge visitors anywhere between $30,000 and $130,000 or more, in return for organising their permits, equipment, finding a guide, and ensuring an emergency plan is in place. This also includes an $11,000 fee which goes directly to the Nepalese government.

High-end luxury packages may include up to as many as five Sherpas per climber to manage bespoke demands such as unlimited bottled oxygen, more comfortable tents or even hot showers.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Two climbers set off with their guide towards Everest Base Camp

Kami describes his community as the ""army of the mountains"". But like many Sherpas, he feels that despite being an integral part of Nepal's tourism industry, their contribution is barely recognised by the government.

""We sacrifice everything for the mountain,"" says Kami. ""We know the mountains the best and can help to save them like no-one else can. But the government has to trust us and make our profession a secure one.""

According to Nepal's Department for Tourism, since 2010 the total number of registered Sherpas has decreased by a fifth. Many say they would prefer their children to stay in school rather than follow in their footsteps.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A young porter, aged 14, rests on his way to a hotel while making a delivery

Many of Kami's frustrations with his own government relate to his experience on 18 April 2014, when 16 Sherpas were killed after a devastating earthquake triggered an avalanche at Khumbu Icefalls.

The icefall is a notoriously steep and treacherous part of the Khumbu glacier which climbers must negotiate between Base Camp and Camp 1. It is considered by most Sherpas to be more dangerous than standing on the top of Everest because large pieces of ice can easily become dislodged without warning.

Following the tragedy, the Nepalese government introduced medical and life insurance policies for all Sherpas working on the mountain. But for Kami, who lost an uncle and two close friends in the disaster, this was simply not enough.

On the day of the avalanche, he remembers being woken by his brother rushing into his tent at Base Camp. Following Lapka out on to the ice, Kami saw large groups of Sherpas gathered around on walkie-talkies.

Less than 2km north, dozens of Sherpas had been preparing the path at the icefall for the next season of incoming tourists. Huge blocks of ice the size of cars broke off the nearby glacier and fell over 1km right on top of where the group of Sherpas were working.

""We've always feared the Khumbu Icefall,"" Kami says. ""But that day, our fear materialised into a catastrophe.""

As the brothers headed up the mountain to help, Kami remembers seeing human limbs scattered in the snow. His brother discovered 11 bodies which had been forced together under the impact of the avalanche.

""We tried our best, but in the mountains, everything happens so quickly. We were powerless,"" says Kami.

As compensation, the government offered $400 to every family affected, less than a quarter of what a novice Sherpa would hope to bring home in a single season. The community were furious.

""That was all our lives were worth!"" says Kami.

After the avalanche, Lakpa vowed never to return to the summit again. He now manages expeditions only from Base Camp. However, Kami, with little education, felt he had no alternative but to carry on climbing. His fear of the icefall has never left him.

""It's still the same,"" he says. ""I still see the bodies sticking out of the ice every time I pass by.""

Image caption Lakpa Jangmu Sherpa (C) and Kami Rita Sherpa (R) at home with their family

After months of being away from his wife and children, on 25 May Kami finally arrived home. His wife Lakpa Jangmu had made a cake with the candles ""24"" confirming her husband's record-breaking achievements.

But surrounded by trophies stacked up along the living-room shelves and a life-sized poster of ""Kami, the world record breaker"" mounted just behind the sofa, it all raised the question, would he set out to break his own world record again next year?

""So many things in my life are uncertain and left without a plan,"" he says with a cheeky smile.

""I will think about next year... next year.""

6,The long echo of WW2 trauma,Stephen Mulvey,"Image copyright Alamy Image caption Richard Burton and Arthur ""Dutch Schultz played by Richard Beymer in The Longest Day

World War One and Vietnam are the wars most closely associated with post-traumatic stress - but it was also a huge problem for the combatants in World War Two, and one that may still be affecting their children and grandchildren today.

At the end of the 1962 film, The Longest Day, a young American paratrooper shares a cigarette somewhere in Normandy with a British fighter pilot, played by Richard Burton. It's a meeting of innocence and experience. Burton's character has been fighting since the Blitz but has finally received a wound that will end his war. For the hapless Pte Arthur ""Dutch"" Schultz, on the other hand, it's all just beginning. After landing in a tree miles from his intended drop zone, he's spent his first day of combat searching for his unit, walking towards the sound of fighting, but never reaching it. He hasn't yet fired a shot in anger.

The real Dutch Schultz's D-Day bore little comparison. It's true he was dropped in the wrong place, but after making contact with other wandering soldiers he soon came under fierce mortar fire and witnessed the mercy killing of a horribly wounded US soldier. By evening he was engaged in a bitter battle for control of a bridge near the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, which continued for four days until German forces eventually withdrew.

In the Netherlands in September 1944, Schultz frantically prayed with his rosary as his company commander died in front of him. For two weeks that winter he was treated in hospital for pneumonia; when he returned more than half his regiment had been killed in the Battle of the Bulge. The horrors culminated in the liberation of the Wöbbelin concentration camp, where he later said ""it was difficult to distinguish the living from the dead"".

Image caption Dutch Schultz at his wedding in 1945

Whether or not the irrepressible boy-next-door played by actor Richard Beymer in The Longest Day bore any relation to the real Schultz who parachuted into France, the man who returned home to the US was entirely different. The happy-go-lucky joker his girlfriend had been waiting for since 1943 had turned sombre and melancholy. After they married in December 1945, she had her first experience of his nightmares - as they travelled west by train to visit his parents, he shouted in his sleep and tried to climb out of the window. She also noticed that he had began to swig regularly from a flask.

""My father was a functioning alcoholic,"" says Schultz's daughter, Carol Schultz Vento. ""It was self-medicating, really.""

The dominant narrative at this time was relentlessly upbeat, she says. The heroes of World War Two were now building a prosperous post-war society. People who remarked upon the large numbers of marriages in the immediate post-war period tended not to mention the record number of divorces. The fact that veterans' hospitals were full of men with serious mental health problems went undiscussed. The movies of the 50s and 60s did not depict the reality of war.

""People did not want to know what it was like,"" her father told her.

Image caption Dutch Schultz and his daughter, Carol

Unlike some troubled veterans, Dutch Schultz was never violent and didn't fly into rages. When he was drunk he was ""either goofy or crying"", Carol says.

But his nightmares continued for the rest of his life. Carol's mother described routinely waking up to find not only the sheets but also the mattress soaked in sweat. After they divorced, Schultz called Carol one night, sobbing down the phone line. His new wife had tried to slit her wrists in the bath and Schultz said he now wanted to kill himself. He had been a terrible father, he said; Carol told him this wasn't true. Years later she learned that he had been holding a gun to his head as they spoke.

After this Schultz went into rehab and built a career running anti-alcohol and anti-addiction programmes. He fought continuously to persuade the Department of Veterans Affairs to recognise and treat the psychological wounds he had brought back from the war, winning this battle only at the age of 80 - two years before he died.

After the existence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was officially recognised by the US government in 1980, in the wake of Vietnam, researchers began to take an interest on the illness on soldiers' families. Studies were already suggesting that the children of Holocaust survivors could be severely affected by the trauma experienced by their parents. ""It would also be easier to believe that they, rather than their parents, had suffered the corrupting, searing hell,"" wrote the author of the first paper on intergenerational trauma among Holocaust survivors.

There has been very little comparable work on the families of traumatised WW2 veterans, but one 1986 paper by Robert Rosenheck, focusing on the families of five men receiving treatment for chronic PTSD, suggested a range of possible outcomes.

""For some of the veterans' offspring,"" he wrote, ""it was as if they were… constantly embroiled in a shared emotional cauldron.""

For these children, life was a series of anticipations of and reactions to their father's moods, impulses and obsessions. For some it resulted in a preoccupation with surviving danger or winning fights - ""a virtual mirroring of issues preoccupying their fathers"". For others, ""the intense emotional involvement consisted of frantic efforts to keep their father calm, out of trouble, and in as good spirits as possible"".

Image caption Carol and Dutch

One of the 12 children in the study, who grew up knowing of his father's nightmares, suffered from enduring nightmares himself, in which he and his father were drafted to fight in a war and he was desperately looking for ways to keep his father from danger.

By contrast there were other children who kept aloof from their fathers, and some who generally disengaged from the emotional life of the family.

The group of children most deeply affected by their fathers' PTSD over-identified with them, Rosenheck said, experiencing ""secondary traumatisation"". Another group, in which there was less evidence of strong identification with their fathers as war veterans, he labelled ""rescuers"". These manifested ""an intense sense of responsibility"" for their fathers, he wrote.

Carol Schultz Vento feels that she is in the ""rescuer"" category. She remained close to her father and took a strong interest in his life and his problems. After therapy herself, she started asking him about things he had never spoken about - and wrote a book about his wartime experiences, his struggles with PTSD and the failure of the post-war society to recognise the suffering of so many servicemen of the ""Greatest Generation"".

Roy ""Eric"" Cooper left Burma at the end of the war, but Burma never left him, according to his granddaughter, Ceri-Anne Edmunds.

""Every second of every day, Burma was with him, even to his last breath,"" she says. ""He would wake up with nightmares every single day.""

Up and about by 4am, he would do the same exercises on a mat every morning, using tins of vegetables as weights, until he died in February this year at the age of 98.

Image caption Roy ""Eric"" Cooper in uniform

In Burma, Cooper was a sniper whose job was to provide cover for troops advancing in the jungle. If a Japanese marksman killed one of his comrades, he felt responsible. He was particularly troubled by one incident when a bullet whizzed past his hat and hit another man in the head. ""I should have got him,"" he said.

On another occasion he had to search for the dead body of a friend. The Japanese soldiers would take the boots and then booby-trap the corpse. Cooper described having to prod the body with a stick to check it was safe to move and to bury.

In some ways he liked the jungle; he liked living close to the animals. He put up with the leeches, foot-rot, shirts that disintegrated from being soaked in sweat. The experience had shaped him before it began to haunt him.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Soldiers in Burma in 1942

Unlike many soldiers of his generation Cooper recognised, on his return to the UK, that he had a problem. He had the courage to go to a doctor and say, ""I don't feel very well in my mind,"" Ceri-Anne says. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist he was referred to compounded the problem by putting him on a high dose of valium, which he continued to take for 10 years.

""It was amazing to begin with, but then it backfired,"" says Ceri-Anne.

He started drinking heavily, occasionally becoming frighteningly angry. Though he was never physically violent, to Ceri-Anne's knowledge, he could be very threatening.

Then, in an extraordinary act of willpower, he stopped taking the valium overnight, stopped drinking and learned to strengthen his powers of self-control by practising martial arts. But now he had another source of guilt - the way he had behaved towards his family.

""I am a bad man,"" he told Ceri-Anne, years later.

""You are my hero,"" she replied.

Image caption Roy ""Eric"" Cooper and Ceri-Anne Edmunds

Cooper fell off the wagon a number of times in his life, and was always prone to outbursts of anger, as well as the nightmares and flashbacks. But he was also loving, protective and supportive of all his family until the day he died, Ceri-Anne says.

Though his behaviour caused strains and divisions within the family, Ceri-Anne grew especially close to her grandfather. He confided in her and listened to her when she gave him advice. She was deeply concerned about his welfare and did whatever she could to help him. Despite the jumping of a generation, her relationship with him mirrors the ""rescuer"" relationship between Carol Schultz Vento and her father.

According to researchers from the Centre for Military Health Research at King's College, London, there is now a consensus that a close relationship exists between the incidence of death and injury on the battlefield and the number of psychiatric casualties, though it may be mediated by the nature of the fighting, the morale of the troops and the quality of leadership.

Normandy and Burma saw some of the most intense fighting of the war, and by 1944 the British military had learned that provision would have to be made for psychiatric treatment. Experience had shown that ""every man has his breaking point"". But the centres set up in Normandy for mental health treatment were nonetheless completely overwhelmed. Many casualties had to be sent back to the UK.

Treatment close to the front was extremely limited. Soldiers were given sedatives to knock them out and enable them to sleep. Then they were given good food, a wash and reassurance. They were described as being ""exhausted"" - a deliberate attempt to demedicalise the condition. It was thought that the term ""shell shock"" used in World War One had encouraged men to believe that they were ill, and set back a natural recovery process.

Despite claims at the time that a large proportion of those treated for exhaustion in Normandy returned to their units, Prof Edgar Jones of the King's Centre for Military Health Research and Stephen Ironside have calculated that only 1% went directly back into action. Some of the rest will have returned to combat after a period of further convalescence. Others were directed into non-combat roles or sent home.

Many traumatised men also managed to keep going without treatment, Jones suggests.

In a study of people receiving war pensions for psychiatric illness between 1940 and 1980, a team of researchers found that the 10 most common symptoms were anxiety, depression, sleep problems, headache, irritability/anger, tremor/shaking, difficulty completing tasks, poor concentration, repeated fears and avoidance of social contact.

Some of these symptoms could contribute to the ""shared emotional cauldron"" detected by Robert Rosenheck in the traumatised veterans' families, which led some children to share their father's pain.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A doctor of the US 82nd Airborne division cares for a wounded German prisoner in Normandy

But for Prof Siobhan O'Neill of Ulster University, the most obvious way for a parent's trauma to affect a child would be by hindering the development of a strong and secure attachment between parent and child in the early years of the child's life.

""It's pretty well accepted that an impact on the attachment between parent and child will impact on mental health,"" she says. ""A traumatised parent can have difficulty forming a secure attachment with the child, and families that have been affected by violence, that are rife with drug and alcohol abuse - dysfunctional families - this is detrimental, and children may not do as well.""

She also finds ""plausible"" recent research that suggests the effects of trauma could be inherited by means of chemical changes to the surface of genes, altering the way they behave. This field of study is known as epigenetics; the relationship between the genes and the chemical changes to their surface (epigenetic marks) has been compared to the relationship between the hardware and software of a computer.

O'Neill points to a study of mice that were given electric shocks when exposed to the scent of cherry blossom. The researchers found that the children and grandchildren of these mice also showed signs of anxiety in the presence of the scent.

There have also been many intriguing studies involving humans. One revealed that children in the womb during a Dutch wartime famine were prone to obesity in adulthood, and tended to die younger than those born just before or conceived just after. The researchers also found an epigenetic mark that these children had in common.

But while scientists have identified a molecular pathway through which the transmission of the effects of trauma from parent to child might occur in mice, this has not yet been achieved in the case of humans.

""At the current time, the idea that epigenetic mechanisms underlie clinical observations in offspring of trauma survivors represents a hypothesis to be tested,"" wrote Rachel Yehuda, one of the leaders in the field, in a paper with Amy Lehrner last year.

O'Neill notes that there is sometimes resistance to the idea of epigenetically transmitted transgenerational trauma ""because it's seen as deterministic… the idea that you are doomed from the start, and that babies are born with a disadvantage"".

If we were all carrying biological traces of our grandfathers' or great-grandfathers' war traumas, not to mention our ancestors' experiences of famine, rape, forced migration or slavery, it would certainly be a gloomy picture.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Battle of the Bulge killed half of Dutch Schultz's regiment

But O'Neill cautions that epigenetic marks are most likely to indicate a predisposition rather than an inevitable outcome - and they can be reversed, she says.

Epigenetics aside, the study of veterans receiving war pensions for psychiatric illness also reconfirms the obvious point that, unlike ""Dutch"" Schultz and ""Eric"" Cooper, people can get better. These days cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is often, though not always, effective.

And trauma can be turned into something positive, O'Neill argues. ""People often talk about how their lives are better for it,"" she says. ""Mum and dad have suffered adversity, but children have overcome that. They are strong. They make a commitment that their own children will not be exposed to it.""

7,The long echo of WW2 trauma,Bbc Stories,"Image copyright Alamy Image caption Richard Burton and Arthur ""Dutch Schultz played by Richard Beymer in The Longest Day

World War One and Vietnam are the wars most closely associated with post-traumatic stress - but it was also a huge problem for the combatants in World War Two, and one that may still be affecting their children and grandchildren today.

At the end of the 1962 film, The Longest Day, a young American paratrooper shares a cigarette somewhere in Normandy with a British fighter pilot, played by Richard Burton. It's a meeting of innocence and experience. Burton's character has been fighting since the Blitz but has finally received a wound that will end his war. For the hapless Pte Arthur ""Dutch"" Schultz, on the other hand, it's all just beginning. After landing in a tree miles from his intended drop zone, he's spent his first day of combat searching for his unit, walking towards the sound of fighting, but never reaching it. He hasn't yet fired a shot in anger.

The real Dutch Schultz's D-Day bore little comparison. It's true he was dropped in the wrong place, but after making contact with other wandering soldiers he soon came under fierce mortar fire and witnessed the mercy killing of a horribly wounded US soldier. By evening he was engaged in a bitter battle for control of a bridge near the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, which continued for four days until German forces eventually withdrew.

In the Netherlands in September 1944, Schultz frantically prayed with his rosary as his company commander died in front of him. For two weeks that winter he was treated in hospital for pneumonia; when he returned more than half his regiment had been killed in the Battle of the Bulge. The horrors culminated in the liberation of the Wöbbelin concentration camp, where he later said ""it was difficult to distinguish the living from the dead"".

Image caption Dutch Schultz at his wedding in 1945

Whether or not the irrepressible boy-next-door played by actor Richard Beymer in The Longest Day bore any relation to the real Schultz who parachuted into France, the man who returned home to the US was entirely different. The happy-go-lucky joker his girlfriend had been waiting for since 1943 had turned sombre and melancholy. After they married in December 1945, she had her first experience of his nightmares - as they travelled west by train to visit his parents, he shouted in his sleep and tried to climb out of the window. She also noticed that he had began to swig regularly from a flask.

""My father was a functioning alcoholic,"" says Schultz's daughter, Carol Schultz Vento. ""It was self-medicating, really.""

The dominant narrative at this time was relentlessly upbeat, she says. The heroes of World War Two were now building a prosperous post-war society. People who remarked upon the large numbers of marriages in the immediate post-war period tended not to mention the record number of divorces. The fact that veterans' hospitals were full of men with serious mental health problems went undiscussed. The movies of the 50s and 60s did not depict the reality of war.

8,Don't get my goat: The island farmers fighting livestock theft,Gemma Handy,"Image copyright Gemma Handy Image caption Goats can fetch thousands of dollars in Antigua

Hiding in a bush, draped in tamarind tree branches and waiting for a hapless goat to stroll by might seem an unlikely way to earn a dollar.

But grabbing a creature unawares while it is tucking into its favourite food is just one of the creative methods used by crafty thieves to snatch livestock in Antigua.

Theft of animals on the eastern Caribbean island is big business. And the traditional practice of allowing goats and sheep to roam free makes them easy prey.

Goats can sell for thousands of dollars each; two or three month's salary for many islanders. And it is putting local farmers out of business.

Goat snatching losses

Byron Lee's animals are kept penned but that has not deterred the crooks. He estimates he has lost $40,000 (£32,000) worth of livestock over the years; all the more galling in a country where $40 is a standard day's wage.

The last theft was keenly felt; his prize goat for which he had paid more than $3,000.

""The criminals watch to see when I leave, before coming in and helping themselves,"" Mr Lee says. ""A lot of farmers have just given up. I'm a second generation farmer and have been doing it all my life but I'm thinking about quitting too.""

Given the nation's taste for goat curry the problems are unlikely to end any time soon. And not without an overhaul of conventional farming practices, says Lennox Francis, who is behind a pioneering new venture created with his British, Royal Veterinary College-trained wife Fiona.

At Goatland, Simon would likely be the first to spot an intruder. A hulking mass of muscle, milky fur and sharpened senses, this majestic Akbash dog with imposing height, and his sister Simple, are tasked with guarding Mr Francis' 3.5-acre farm and its 150 cloven-footed residents.

While Simon diligently scouts the perimeter, Simple watches her flock, a silent but steadfast sentry.

The electric fences and security cameras are an equally rare sight on Antiguan farms.

From poop to power

But Goatland's fresh approach to agriculture goes beyond its savvy surveillance systems.

Set on a former sugar plantation, it is eco-friendly throughout and more than half the creatures here have been hand-reared. The goats' two-storey ""home"" with solar-powered lighting is constructed almost entirely of upcycled shipping pallets, slathered with waste engine oil to preserve the wood.

Image copyright Gemma Handy Image caption Old pallets were used to build the goat shed

Daily poop collection might not sound an enticing chore but it makes for a cheap, efficient and readily available source of energy. Each night, the faeces are loaded into a bio-digester that produces methane to power a cooking stove for staff.

Even better, the slurry created is an excellent organic fertiliser, says Mr Francis, gesturing to an adjacent field abundant with mango and soursop trees, avocado seedlings and coconut palms.

A handful of Goatland's other inhabitants will not be going anywhere near the abattoir. Bambi, the sole fallow deer, was brought to Mrs Francis' veterinary surgery from Antigua's sister island Barbuda with a broken leg after Hurricane Irma.

And Bob the Friesian bull, attacked by dogs at two weeks' old and nursed back to health, will also live out his years here.

Mr and Mrs Francis plan to develop a unique breed of goat, hardy enough to withstand the drought-prone climate which poses additional headaches for Antigua's embattled farmers.

For Mrs Francis, originally from Watford, England, the project followed extensive research to identify the best goat genes for the climes, and training in artificial insemination.

""My vision is to provide a supply of a superior breed stock of goat to Antiguans who wish to go into livestock farming, and to showcase a production method that's sustainable and profitable here,"" Mrs Francis, who also makes soap and cheese from the animals' milk, says.

Low-maintenance New Zealand Kiko goats, like the sturdy-looking horned couple nicknamed John and Tina, are being bred with local varieties, including some from the country's uninhabited third isle, Redonda.

Image copyright Gemma Handy Image caption The goats are hand raised

If successful, Goatland could help reduce Antigua's reliance on costly meat imports which topped $20 million in 2017.

Training the next generation

Training the next generation of farmers will be critical and visits by local schools are encouraged.

""We're trying to get children interested in agriculture,"" Mr Francis explains. ""We're meat eaters in the Caribbean; everyone loves their curry goat and baked lamb. But someone has to look after those animals, and that means hard work.

Image copyright Gemma Handy Image caption Lennox and Fiona Francis are keen to pass on their knowledge to youngsters on the island

""Farmers use so much energy searching for their animals when they let them roam,"" he continues. ""Plus, wandering creatures cause road accidents and are always impacting someone else's garden or crops.""

Owalabi Elabanjo, from the ministry of agriculture, hopes the proposed introduction of identification cards for farmers will bring greater control over the largely unregulated sector.

Educating local businesses about the requirement to see the cards before buying meat might deter people from becoming accomplices to the illegal trade, he says.

9,Don't get my goat: The island farmers fighting livestock theft,St John'S,"Image copyright Gemma Handy Image caption Goats can fetch thousands of dollars in Antigua

Hiding in a bush, draped in tamarind tree branches and waiting for a hapless goat to stroll by might seem an unlikely way to earn a dollar.

But grabbing a creature unawares while it is tucking into its favourite food is just one of the creative methods used by crafty thieves to snatch livestock in Antigua.

Theft of animals on the eastern Caribbean island is big business. And the traditional practice of allowing goats and sheep to roam free makes them easy prey.

Goats can sell for thousands of dollars each; two or three month's salary for many islanders. And it is putting local farmers out of business.

Goat snatching losses

Byron Lee's animals are kept penned but that has not deterred the crooks. He estimates he has lost $40,000 (£32,000) worth of livestock over the years; all the more galling in a country where $40 is a standard day's wage.

The last theft was keenly felt; his prize goat for which he had paid more than $3,000.

""The criminals watch to see when I leave, before coming in and helping themselves,"" Mr Lee says. ""A lot of farmers have just given up. I'm a second generation farmer and have been doing it all my life but I'm thinking about quitting too.""

Given the nation's taste for goat curry the problems are unlikely to end any time soon. And not without an overhaul of conventional farming practices, says Lennox Francis, who is behind a pioneering new venture created with his British, Royal Veterinary College-trained wife Fiona.

At Goatland, Simon would likely be the first to spot an intruder. A hulking mass of muscle, milky fur and sharpened senses, this majestic Akbash dog with imposing height, and his sister Simple, are tasked with guarding Mr Francis' 3.5-acre farm and its 150 cloven-footed residents.

While Simon diligently scouts the perimeter, Simple watches her flock, a silent but steadfast sentry.

The electric fences and security cameras are an equally rare sight on Antiguan farms.

From poop to power

But Goatland's fresh approach to agriculture goes beyond its savvy surveillance systems.

Set on a former sugar plantation, it is eco-friendly throughout and more than half the creatures here have been hand-reared. The goats' two-storey ""home"" with solar-powered lighting is constructed almost entirely of upcycled shipping pallets, slathered with waste engine oil to preserve the wood.

Daily poop collection might not sound an enticing chore but it makes for a cheap, efficient and readily available source of energy. Each night, the faeces are loaded into a bio-digester that produces methane to power a cooking stove for staff.

Even better, the slurry created is an excellent organic fertiliser, says Mr Francis, gesturing to an adjacent field abundant with mango and soursop trees, avocado seedlings and coconut palms.

A handful of Goatland's other inhabitants will not be going anywhere near the abattoir. Bambi, the sole fallow deer, was brought to Mrs Francis' veterinary surgery from Antigua's sister island Barbuda with a broken leg after Hurricane Irma.

And Bob the Friesian bull, attacked by dogs at two weeks' old and nursed back to health, will also live out his years here.

Mr and Mrs Francis plan to develop a unique breed of goat, hardy enough to withstand the drought-prone climate which poses additional headaches for Antigua's embattled farmers.

For Mrs Francis, originally from Watford, England, the project followed extensive research to identify the best goat genes for the climes, and training in artificial insemination.

""My vision is to provide a supply of a superior breed stock of goat to Antiguans who wish to go into livestock farming, and to showcase a production method that's sustainable and profitable here,"" Mrs Francis, who also makes soap and cheese from the animals' milk, says.

Low-maintenance New Zealand Kiko goats, like the sturdy-looking horned couple nicknamed John and Tina, are being bred with local varieties, including some from the country's uninhabited third isle, Redonda.

If successful, Goatland could help reduce Antigua's reliance on costly meat imports which topped $20 million in 2017.

Training the next generation

Training the next generation of farmers will be critical and visits by local schools are encouraged.

""We're trying to get children interested in agriculture,"" Mr Francis explains. ""We're meat eaters in the Caribbean; everyone loves their curry goat and baked lamb. But someone has to look after those animals, and that means hard work.

Image copyright Gemma Handy Image caption Lennox and Fiona Francis are keen to pass on their knowledge to youngsters on the island

""Farmers use so much energy searching for their animals when they let them roam,"" he continues. ""Plus, wandering creatures cause road accidents and are always impacting someone else's garden or crops.""

Owalabi Elabanjo, from the ministry of agriculture, hopes the proposed introduction of identification cards for farmers will bring greater control over the largely unregulated sector.

Educating local businesses about the requirement to see the cards before buying meat might deter people from becoming accomplices to the illegal trade, he says.

""Livestock theft has been going on for decades. I don't believe there's a single farmer in Antigua who hasn't been a victim,"" Mr Elabanjo adds.

""The country doesn't yet produce enough goats to meet our demands but with better regulations, farmers could focus on production and help reduce our import bill.

10,Trump visit: Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit?,Rachel Schraer,"Image copyright Getty Images

Along with the pomp, protests and politics, President Trump's visit to the UK brought renewed debate about whether a post-Brexit trade deal between the two countries could involve opening up the NHS to US companies.

Mr Trump told a press conference: ""When you're dealing with trade, everything's on the table - so the NHS or anything else"".

He quickly rowed back, saying he did not consider the NHS to be part of trade - though not before MPs from across the political spectrum had come out to say the health service was ""not for sale"".

The question is what ""for sale"" would actually mean.

As health think tank the Nuffield Trust points out, ""a trade deal would not have the power to stop the NHS being a free, universal service"".

But could greater market access to the health service for US companies be up for negotiation?

Private companies in the NHS

The NHS is funded by government through taxes. Decisions about how to spend money and how to deliver care are made by public bodies, not operating for profit.

But there are already various opportunities for private companies - including US firms - to win business within the NHS.

Out of a budget of more than £120 billion a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12.

All drugs and equipment have to be bought from the private sector, and the UK imports about £2bn of pharmaceutical products a year from the US - 9% of total drug imports in 2018.

And while the vast majority of care is done by staff directly employed by the NHS, the health service also pays private companies to deliver some care, which is still free for patients at the point of use.

That might be via a contract to run a specific service, like an immunisation programme, or under a rolling agreement with a private hospital that they will take on some NHS patients for elective surgeries like hip and knee replacements.

US companies can already bid for these kinds of contracts.

It's worth pointing out that health is a devolved matter and there are different commissioning arrangements in place around the UK.

US companies in the NHS

There are a number of US companies working in the NHS, particularly in England, though on a fairly small scale.

The biggest private providers of NHS services at the moment are British, while companies from Australia, South Africa, the EU and elsewhere also deliver some services.

US healthcare giant UnitedHealth has an offshoot company in the UK called Optum. It gathers and analyses data on population health, which is then used to help make decisions about which services to buy in.

It doesn't run any clinical services, although its parent company UnitedHealth did run six GP practices until 2011.

HCA Healthcare, also known as the Hospital Corporation of America, runs some private hospitals, mainly in London.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption HCA runs the private Portland Hospital, birthplace of celebrities' babies and royals including Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie

It says that less than 1% of the care it provides is to NHS patients, ""predominantly where we have provided additional capacity to the NHS when they are faced with increased pressures in their hospitals.""

It has three ""joint ventures"" with the NHS in London and Manchester, where it provides paid-for treatment for private patients within an NHS hospital. HCA pays the NHS for use of the hospital space.

The Acadia Group, which owns the Priory chain of hospitals, again mainly does private work in the UK. But it does have beds for NHS patients in 87 of its hospitals, which provide a range of mental health services including for addiction and eating disorders.

How could they become more involved?

The UK currently opens up its market, including public services, to competition as part of the EU single market. That means companies can use competition law to sue the NHS.

This was taken further in England by the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which says that contracts have to be put out to competitive tender.

Under EU law, though, there are explicit protections for health services which a judge has to take into consideration if a dispute between a foreign company and a member state gets to court.

It's possible the US would want a trade deal that didn't include these kinds of protections, according to Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

It's also possible, according to Prof McKee, that the US negotiators could use a trade deal as an opportunity to push for more favourable contracts in the NHS, for example contracts allowing them to only treat less complex and more lucrative patients, leaving the NHS with the most challenging and expensive cases.

Whether the UK would agree to this is a different matter.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Campaigners in London protesting against the US-EU trade deal known as TTIP

This was a sticking point in the negotiations over an EU-US trade deal - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - which failed.

The US wanted to be able to use an Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) process which is very commonly used in international treaties. It means that if an investor in a country feels it is being discriminated against, it can take that country to an arbitration panel to seek compensation.

The concern from campaign groups in the UK at the time was that this process would be closed and not as transparent as if it had to go through the courts.

These are all issues which would be likely to become relevant again in any future trade negotiations.

Drug pricing

Independent MP Sarah Wollaston told the BBC that President Trump's recent comments still left the door open for drug prices being part of trade negotiations.

She referred to comments by the US health secretary on CNBC last year that the country would use trade talks to ""pressure"" other countries to pay more for their drugs.

A document from the Office of the US Trade Representative in February, setting out negotiating objectives with the UK, includes a section on pharmaceuticals mentioning ""full market access for US products"".

Jane Lethbridge, director of the Public Services International Research Unit at the University of Greenwich, says drug companies could use trade talks as an opportunity to lobby for more influence on decision-making.

For example, they could attempt to influence the fixed cost per benefit price the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) uses to decide whether a drug should be commissioned in the NHS, opening up a market for more US drugs.

And they could seek to push up drug prices. In the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal, the US negotiated greater protections for new drugs it develops, stopping competition from other companies to develop generic versions of them for longer periods, keeping prices higher.

It remains to be seen what the US would ask for as part of trade negotiations, but it would still be the case that the NHS as a large single buyer has a lot of clout to negotiate prices.

12,Europe's press sees Brexit as May's 'spectacular failure',Bbc Monitoring,"Image copyright BBC Monitoring Image caption The European press is closely following Mrs May's long departure

The press and news sites across Europe agree that Theresa May's premiership will be defined by her failure to get the Brexit bill through parliament, and see Boris Johnson as her most likely successor.

'Failed spectacularly'

The prime minister's ""main task was to lead the United Kingdom out of the EU. Well, that did not really work out,"" says Germany's centre-left daily Süddeutsche Zeitung, in a view echoed across the continent.

German business daily Handelsblatt agrees that ""posterity will only remember how spectacularly she failed in this task"", although it does offer her the cold comfort of having outlasted the ""similarly hapless Gordon Brown"" in office.

Many papers attribute Mrs May's failure to personal shortcomings.

Austria's liberal Der Standard says her ""inability to reach compromise"" made her resignation inevitable.

Spanish analysis site El Confidencial compares her unfavourably with Margaret Thatcher, as Mrs Thatcher was a ""radical reformer"" while Mrs May is a ""competent manager, but without any vision"".

It also sees her ""lack of ease in communication"" as a barrier to winning allies in parliament.

France's RFI public radio agrees on the inevitability of her departure, but attributes it to the intractability of a Brexit process that also cost her predecessor David Cameron his job.

""Brexit is decidedly bad luck"", it concludes.

Italy's conservative Il Giornale agrees Mrs May was brought down by the ""earthquake unleashed on the Tory party by her failure to achieve Brexit"", recalling that the party ""did not hesitate to take down a living monument like Margaret Thatcher as soon as the Iron Lady's unpopularity threatened its position in government"".

'Without glitz... but with dignity'

But some newspapers are more sympathetic.

France's Le Figaro cannot help feeling for Mrs May after ""two years of accumulated defeats, humiliations and fouls"", crowned by President Donald Trump saying Boris Johnson would make an ""excellent"" prime minister on his state visit to Britain this week.

Bulgaria's popular Dnevnik site praises her for ""bravely facing up to a difficult task... She leaves 10 Downing Street just as she arrived, without glitz, without success, but with dignity"".

Image copyright BBC Monitoring Image caption For Bulgaria's Duma, Brexit is a political Titanic

Her deep, Christian faith is also picked up by Le Figaro and Belgium's Le Soir, which both refer to Brexit as her ""long Way of the Cross"".

Dutch centrist daily NRC Handelsblad wonders whether her failure was more due to ""male obstruction of the second woman to hold her office"", and concludes that she had some grounds for ""anger at being treated unfairly"".

Sweden's Boras Tidning also saw Mrs May as ""a vicar's daughter... dutiful beyond all reasonable limits"", being ""held hostage by a small group of scheming men in her government"".

It says the tears she shed when she announced her resignation last month show that ""her failure is something more, deeper and very personal"".

Belgium's RTBF public broadcaster thinks her main problem was having to ""fight to deliver Brexit she did not really believe in"" - what it calls a ""ball and chain that would eventually drag her down"".

Hungary's conservative Magyar Nemzet says that, contrary to received wisdom, Theresa May was ""perfectly aware that compromise was needed to implement Brexit"", but failed to find a readiness to compromise elsewhere on the British political scene.

It also warns that anyone who expects her successor to ""resolve the political stalemate in one go is very much mistaken"".

'Disastrous legacy'

Others are less forgiving.

Belgium's liberal La Libre Belgique says Mrs May's ""disastrous legacy... is a country and party on the verge of crisis"".

""British society's wounds, far from being dressed, have been opened up a little more,"" it says, highlighting not only Brexit but also the ""tragic consequences"" of her cuts to public services.

Hungary's centre-left Heti Vilaggazdasag is harsher.

""She wanted to become a second Margaret Thatcher, but ended up a second Anthony Eden"", a reference to the Conservative prime minister who resigned after the Suez Canal crisis of 1956.

Image copyright BBC Monitoring Image caption Heti Vilaggazdasag says Brexit will trap whoever succeeds Mrs May

""A new crushing election defeat humiliates Theresa May again,"" says Denmark's Berlingske daily, noting that the Peterborough by-election saw the Conservatives come third.

""Theresa May ends her leadership as she began - on a downturn,"" it concludes.

Czech centre-right daily Mlada Fronta Dnes criticises her negotiating skills, saying she ""behaved like a beggar"" in Brussels, which ""wanted to make an example of the British outcast"".

""Why did May make it so easy for them?"" it asks.

'Eurosceptic opportunist'

Looking ahead, Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has no doubt that Theresa May's ""greatest rival"" Boris Johnson has the best chance of succeeding her from among the ""large and dazzling"" array of contenders.

And Germany's left-liberal Stern magazine agrees ""Boris Johnson is her most likely successor"", not that this means he is well-regarded in Europe.

Image copyright BBC Monitoring Image caption Boris Johnson is seen as the clear favourite to succeed

Indeed, France's L'Obs weekly portrays him as a ""Eurosceptic opportunist"" who has been ""waiting so long for this day"".

Italy's Corriere della Sera sees an ""unprecedented political crisis"" ahead, as the new prime minister will be chosen ""in a bizarre procedure by 124,000 mostly white, middle-class, older"" Conservative Party members.

As for the ""clear favourite Boris Johnson, he has already launched a campaign to win back voters who migrated to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party by promising an uncompromising Brexit,"" it says.

Austria's Heute says this approach from ""one of the toughest fighters for Brexit has persuaded many that he is capable of recapturing disappointed Brexit voters"".

Spain's La Razon concludes that whoever succeeds Theresa May will come from the ""tough wing of Eurosceptics"", and will insist on the United Kingdom leaving before 31 October with or without a deal.

""Theresa May ends her leadership as she began - on a downturn,"" it concludes.

Czech centre-right daily Mlada Fronta Dnes criticises her negotiating skills, saying she ""behaved like a beggar"" in Brussels, which ""wanted to make an example of the British outcast"".

'Eurosceptic opportunist'

Looking ahead, Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has no doubt that Theresa May's ""greatest rival"" Boris Johnson has the best chance of succeeding her from among the ""large and dazzling"" array of contenders.

And Germany's left-liberal Stern magazine agrees ""Boris Johnson is her most likely successor"", not that this means he is well-regarded in Europe.

Italy's Corriere della Sera sees an ""unprecedented political crisis"" ahead, as the new prime minister will be chosen ""in a bizarre procedure by 124,000 mostly white, middle-class, older"" Conservative Party members.

As for the ""clear favourite Boris Johnson, he has already launched a campaign to win back voters who migrated to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party by promising an uncompromising Brexit,"" it says.

Austria's Heute says this approach from ""one of the toughest fighters for Brexit has persuaded many that he is capable of recapturing disappointed Brexit voters"".

Spain's La Razon concludes that whoever succeeds Theresa May will come from the ""tough wing of Eurosceptics"", and will insist on the United Kingdom leaving before 31 October with or without a deal.

14,China social media: WeChat and the Surveillance State,Stephen Mcdonell,"China's WeChat is a site for social interaction, a form of currency, a dating app, a tool for sporting teams and deliverer of news: Twitter, Facebook, Googlemaps, Tinder and Apple Pay all rolled into one. But it is also an ever more powerful weapon of social control for the Chinese government.

I've just been locked out of WeChat (or Weixin 微信 as it is known in Chinese) and, to get back on, have had to pass through some pretty Orwellian steps - steps which have led others to question why I went along with it.

One reason is that life in Beijing would be extremely difficult without WeChat. The other is that I could not have written this piece without experiencing the stages which have now clearly put my image, and even my voice, on some sort of biometric database of troublemakers.

I was in Hong Kong to cover the enormous candlelight vigil marking 30 years since the People's Liberation Army was ordered to open fire on its own people to remove the mostly student protesters who'd been gathering in and around Tiananmen Square for months in June 1989.

This moment in history has been all but erased from public discourse on mainland China but in Hong Kong, with its special status in the Chinese-speaking world, people turn out every year to remember the bloody crackdown.

This time round the crowd was particularly huge, with estimates ranging up to 180,000.

Naturally I took photos of the sea of people holding candles and singing, and posted some of these on my WeChat ""moments"".

The post contained no words - just photos.

Chinese friends started asking on WeChat what the event was? Why were people gathering? Where was it?

That such questions were coming from young professionals here shows the extent to which knowledge of Tiananmen 1989 has been made to disappear in China.

I answered a few of them, rather cryptically, then suddenly I was locked out of WeChat.

""Your login has been declined due to account exceptions. Try to log in again and proceed as instructed,"" came the message on the screen.

Then, when I tried to log back in, a new message appeared: ""This WeChat account has been suspected of spreading malicious rumours and has been temporarily blocked…""

It seems posting photos of an actual event taking place, without commentary, amounts to ""spreading malicious rumours"" in China.

I was given time to try and log in again the next day after my penalty had been served.

When I did I had to push ""agree and unblock"" under the stated reason of ""spread malicious rumours"".

So this rumour-monger clicked on ""agree"".

Then came a stage I was not prepared for. ""Faceprint is required for security purposes,"" it said.

I was instructed to hold my phone up - to ""face front camera straight on"" - looking directly at the image of a human head. Then told to ""Read numbers aloud in Mandarin Chinese"".

My voice was captured by the App at the same time it scanned my face.

Afterwards a big green tick: ""Approved""

Apart from being creepy you can only imagine the potential use of this type of data.

No doubt I have now joined some list of suspicious individuals in the hands of goodness knows which Chinese government agencies.

In China pretty much everyone has WeChat. I don't know a single person without it. Developed by tech giant Tencent it is an incredible app. It's convenient. It works. It's fun. It was ahead of the game on the global stage and it has found its way into all corners of people's existence.

It could deliver to the Communist Party a life map of pretty much everybody in this country, citizens and foreigners alike.

Capturing the face and voice image of everyone who was suspended for mentioning the Tiananmen crackdown anniversary in recent days would be considered very useful for those who want to monitor anyone who might potentially cause problems.

When I placed details of this entire process on Twitter others were asking: why cave in to such a Big Brother intrusion on your privacy?

They've probably not lived in China.

It is hard to imagine a life here without it.

When you meet somebody in a work context they don't given you a name card any more, they share their WeChat; if you play for a football team training details are on WeChat; children's school arrangements, WeChat; Tinder-style dates, WeChat; movie tickets, WeChat; news stream, WeChat; restaurant locations, WeChat; paying for absolutely everything from a bowl of noodles to clothes to a dining room table… WeChat.

People wouldn't be able to speak to their friends or family without it.

So the censors who can lock you out of Wechat hold real power over you.

The app - thought by Western intelligence agencies to be the least secure of its type in the world - has essentially got you over a barrel.

16,Where are Liberia's missing millions?,Kanika Saigal,"Image copyright Reuters

Liberians are angry about the apparent disappearance of state funds - and are planning a protest march on Friday to demand answers.

Their anger centres on two scandals:

Revelations last year that $15.5bn Liberian dollars ($104m, £82m) of freshly minted currency had disappeared from Liberia's ports The mismanagement of a 25m US dollar cash injection into the economy last year.

What happened?

In September 2018, local media reported that shipping containers filled with newly printed Liberian dollars from Swedish banknote manufacturer Crane AB disappeared from Liberia's entry ports between 2016 and 2017.

The Central Bank of Liberia denied the allegations and stated that the money was stored in vaults across the city.

Image copyright BBC/Jonathan Paye-Layleh Image caption There have been small demonstrations over the missing money over the last year

Just a few months before the revelation, President George Weah, who came into office in January 2018, announced that the central bank would pump $25m into the economy to replace older Liberian dollars.

The Liberian dollar has been losing value - or depreciating - since July 2017. This has led to higher import costs and inflation, which means that everyday goods have become much more expensive for the average person in the country.

The president's ""mop-up"" exercise, as it was dubbed, took place between July and October last year. It intended to reduce the amount of local currency in the economy to slow further depreciation.

But there were a number of concerns around the exercise and unanswered questions about the shipments of cash into Liberia. Two reports were commissioned to examine the details. The government's Presidential Investigative Team (PIT) completed one. Risk advisory firm Kroll, the other.

Both found major flaws in how government policy was implemented in each case, and neither the PIT nor Kroll were able to account for all of the newly printed Liberian dollars or the additional US dollars in the country.

What were the findings?

According to Kroll, only L$5bn of the total L$15.5bn was printed and distributed in line with Liberian law. The central bank did not receive legislative approval for the remainder of the cash, but entered into another contract with Crane who proceeded to print and deliver the money to Liberia anyway.

Kroll also found an excess of L$2.6bn was printed in addition to what was initially disclosed. The PIT's report recorded a similar finding.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Charles Sirleaf (centre) is going on trial in the coming weeks

There is still little information on what happened to this excess, but the former executive governor of the Central Bank, Milton Weeks, and his former deputy, Charles Sirleaf - both in charge of the central bank when the notes were ordered - were arrested in March on the PIT's recommendation.

Mr Sirleaf, son of former President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, and Mr Weeks are due in court for the start of the trial in the coming weeks when they will be asked to enter a plea to the charges.

Ex-President Sirleaf said her son, who along with Mr Weeks has been released from prison but banned from leaving the country, had been unjustifiably and illegally charged. As for the US dollars pumped into the Liberian economy, this is where each reports differs slightly.

According to Kroll, the central bank sold $15m for L$2.3bn. This means that US dollars replaced older Liberian notes in the economy. The PIT report, however, stated that in addition to the $15m, another $2m was sold to oil and gas company Total.

But the PIT also outlined that 15 of the companies listed by the central bank to have taken part in the ""mop-up"" exercise denied any involvement. Another eight companies listed by the central bank were not in operation when the PIT made their visit.

So where has all the extra money gone?

As for the extra L$2.6bn printed ""the most likely answer is that it is in the pockets of self-interested individuals,"" says Euler Bropleh, a Liberian national and founder and managing director of VestedWorld, a private equity firm that invests across Africa.

This has not yet been proven and remains speculation at this point.

You may also be interested in:

As for the $15m to $17m as part of the ""mop-up"" exercise, this may be even harder to calculate. While some of the money was distributed to a number of companies, proper records were not kept.

This is because the distribution of cash ""deviated from conventional best practice"", according to the PIT. For example, many records were written by hand, which could lead to a number of errors.

According to Kroll, this exercise has left the country open to ""potential misappropriation of banknotes, potential opportunities for money laundering and potential execution of transactions with illegal businesses"".

In other words, the money may never be accounted for. But it doesn't end there.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Weah told the BBC on the anniversary of his first year in office that the missing money, more than $100m of newly printed cash, was being investigated

The BBC reported that the president received a letter from nine ambassadors, concerned that his government was taking money reserved for programmes funded by foreign donors from the central bank.

The World Bank has also complained that millions of dollars was removed from accounts earmarked for providing drinking water or for projects such as responding to the Ebola crisis. Calculating where all of Liberia's missing money is will require another rigorous audit, which the president has requested.

Meanwhile, the PIT recommends a demonetisation exercise - the withdrawal of current Liberian dollars from circulation and replaced with an alternative - to cut illegal activity and stabilise the economy.

What is happening now?

While one of the main aims of Liberia's policy makers was to stop the currency from losing any more value against the dollar, their actions have actually had the opposite effect.

Of the newly printed notes, Kroll recorded that more than L$10bn was fed into the Liberian economy without withdrawing any older notes. Of the ""mop-up"" money, $5m was also pumped into the economy without any withdrawal of local currency.

In fact, Kroll also reported that the old Liberian dollars were reintroduced into the economy within six months of being removed from circulation.

""Inflation continues to rise and the Liberian economy has tanked,"" says Taa Wongbe, an executive member of the Alternative National Congress and senior adviser to the leader of the opposition party.

""On the fight against corruption, the needle has not moved forward dramatically and we expect change,"" he says.

It is a sobering situation for the government as Mr Bropleh warns that people will not want to take the risk of investing in Liberia at the moment, so the economy may struggle further.

For the protesters, their hope is that the next audit will allow the president and the government to take action on policy makers that are yet to be held to account.","In September 2018, local media reported that shipping containers filled with newly printed Liberian dollars from Swedish banknote manufacturer Crane AB disappeared from Liberia's entry ports between 2016 and 2017.

18,,Alison Holt,"For many people, the line between what the NHS will help with and what local authorities will do is a blur. That’s certainly what Rita McAllister’s family has found.

“I don’t think you realise what goes on until you are involved in the system,” says Rita’s daughter, Siobhan Madden. Rita, 77, is sitting in her armchair watching the world out of her window. The other side of the glass, the streets of Taunton are set out in a patchwork before them.

Rita has Parkinson’s disease and needs a lot of help. For a long time, she was cared for at home by her family. Siobhan gave up her job to look after Rita for six years, but as Rita’s health deteriorated they needed more help. At first, because of Rita’s very high needs, the NHS paid for her social care under a scheme called Continuing Health Care - the same scheme that eventually provided support for Martine Evans.

The social care provided by the NHS is not means-tested and is only available for those assessed with the highest health needs. But many people don’t realise that. A recent poll for the Local Government Association found that 44% of people questioned believed that the NHS provides adult social care for everyone, not councils, and 28% thought generally social care was free.

When someone does qualify for health-service-funded social care, they often find their budget is more generous than it is when they are supported by their council. Rita’s health seemed to improve with the level of support the NHS was providing and her family believed that because it was working well, it would continue. But a year later in 2017, Rita’s case was reviewed. It was decided she no longer met the criteria for free NHS social care. Even though her family argued that it was the level of support she was getting that had stabilised her condition, NHS funding was withdrawn.

This meant responsibility for her care now fell to Somerset County Council, but it wouldn’t pay for as much support. The family were already doing a lot of care. Now they had to fill in the gaps.

“Obviously Siobhan was getting tired,” Rita’s son Sean says. “It was difficult for me because I was working full time. If I was staying the night I might be up for long periods, and then going straight to work. Over a period of time that becomes quite draining and difficult to manage.”

Siobhan became ill and her mother’s health got worse too. Rita’s pain levels were increasingly hard to manage and eventually she ended up in hospital. From there, she was moved to a nursing home. Once again, the question of who will pay for her care is being discussed. With Rita in a nursing home, the value of her home is now included in the council’s financial calculations. It means she is expected to sell the house she loves.

Georgia Ayling, Rita’s social worker, has got to know the family well over the past few months.

“Rita has very, very strongly said all the way through she doesn’t want to sell her home. It will be a situation she is forced into if funding comes back to the local authority,” says Georgia. “I can’t agree with it, but it is the way it is. There are no allowances for people, because everyone who has social care is in the same situation.”

“They moved into this house in 1964,” says Siobhan standing in the kitchen of her mother’s home. “They were the first people to move in as a council house and eventually they bought it.”

Lined up on top of a cupboard are teapots of all shapes, sizes and patterns. Siobhan and her brother Sean chuckle at the memories of how their Mum would welcome everyone into their home with the offer of a cup of tea and a chat. “Everyone would leave feeling better,” says Sean, smiling.

Rita’s children accept the house may have to be sold, but say it will break their mother’s heart.

It seems like a cop-out to say if you’ve got an illness that is progressive... then you have to fund yourself Sean McAllister (Rita's son)

“It is like being penalised, for being ill and seemingly doing the right thing for your family and buying your property.”

“I appreciate care costs a lot of money,” says Sean, “but Mum did not ask to be where she is. It seems like a cop-out to say if you’ve got an illness that is progressive, that’s not going to get better, then you have to fund yourself.”

The alternative is to once again apply to the NHS for Continuing Health Care funding. Social worker Georgia has been helping the family fill out the forms in what all of them find a complicated process.

“Rita’s health is very, very complex,” says Georgia. “It’s an expensive package of care, with a lot of care going in because of Rita’s complex needs. I relied very heavily on the Parkinson's nurse to support the risk assessments and to give me the information about the support and care that Rita needed.”

On a cold January day Georgia and Rita’s children arrive at the nursing home to meet a nurse assessor. She will go through a checklist to decide whether Rita’s needs meet their criteria. The meeting lasts a couple of hours. Georgia emerges from it feeling hopeful, but they won’t know the decision for several weeks.

“I think that Rita should always have been health-funded,” she says. “But I don’t know, I simply can’t say what the outcome is going to be.” The information gathered by the assessor now goes to a panel which will decide whether or not Rita once again qualifies for NHS-funded care.

Three weeks later, the family receive a letter telling them that the health service will pay for Rita’s care. It’s a relief, but the decision will be reviewed in three months.

“What's going to change really in three months? It's a progressive disease,” says Siobhan as she and her brother sit at the table in the kitchen of their mother’s house. “She's not going to get any better. It's just ridiculous really. The whole system of what happens when you become this ill is horrendous really. It's so long-winded, it's so stressful for the family and for Mum.”

“From what I’ve seen it seems to be a battle,” says Sean. “Health wants social care to pay, social care wants health to pay so you’ve got to go through these assessment processes to determine, is it health need? Is it a social need? We’ve been through that and gone backwards again and gone through it again. Politicians need to realise the impact it does have on extended family.”",,"['ritas', 'support', 'rita', 'health', 'nhs', 'siobhan', 'social', 'sean', 'care', 'family']",,https://www.bbc.com/news

Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Pakistan's long battle with militants as part of the post-9/11 ""war on terror"". Evidence of murder and torture by soldiers and insurgents is emerging only now. The BBC has gained rare access to some of the victims.

It was early in 2014 when TV news networks trumpeted a major victory in the war against the Pakistani Taliban - the killing of one of the group's most senior commanders in a night-time air raid.

Adnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border.

Rasheed, a former Pakistan Air Force technician, was well-known. He had written an extraordinary letter to Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl and activist shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in 2012, attempting to justify why it had happened. He'd also been in prison for trying to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf - until he broke out.

Now it appeared that his luck had run out.

Quoting security officials, news channels reported on 22 January 2014 that Adnan Rasheed's hideout had been targeted two nights earlier in the Hamzoni area.

Waziristan and other parts of the vast mountainous tribal region have been controlled and locked-down by the Pakistani military since the US invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11, which saw Taliban fighters, al-Qaeda jihadists and other militants flee over the porous border.

Outsiders, including journalists, cannot get in - so verifying claims from the security forces is extremely difficult. Those who have reported stories from Waziristan that don't reflect well on the military have found themselves punished.

It turned out a year later that the jets had hit the wrong target - Rasheed confirmed this when he emerged in a video to prove he was alive.

Image caption Adnan Rasheed had been sentenced to death for trying to kill former president Pervez Musharraf

Instead of taking out a top militant, Pakistan's military had actually killed the family of a local man who had his home blown to pieces.

The authorities have never acknowledged they made a mistake. The BBC travelled to Dera Ismail Khan, a town on the banks of the river Indus that is the gateway to the remote and forbidding tribal areas, to meet the man whose house was hit.

""It must have been 11pm or thereabouts,"" recalls Nazirullah, who was 20 at the time. He and his wife had recently married and had the rare privilege of a room to themselves. The rest of their large family slept in the only other room in their house in Khatei Kalay village.

""It was as if the house had exploded. My wife and I were shaken out of our sleep. There was a strong smell of gunpowder in the air. Both of us rushed to the door and stepped out, only to discover that the entire roof of our room had already collapsed, except a corner where our bed was.""

Image caption Nazirullah and his niece Sumayya survived but four members of the family were killed

The roof of the second room had also collapsed, and a fire was raging across the compound. Nazirullah heard cries from the rubble and, with his wife, frantically tried to help those they could see in the glow of the fire.

Neighbours helped them dig out the injured and the dead.

Four of Nazirullah's family died, including a three-year-old girl. His niece Sumayya, whose mother was among those killed, was then just a year old, and survived with a fractured hip. Another four members of the family were rescued from the rubble. All suffered fractures and other injuries.

Nazirullah's family has since moved back to Dera Ismail Khan, where life is more peaceful.

Like many others in this part of Pakistan, they have had to move several times to escape an insurgency that has been raging in the tribal areas for nearly two decades.

According to authorities and independent research groups, militant violence since 2002 has forced more than five million people in Pakistan's north-west to leave their homes to seek refuge either in government-run refugee camps or rented houses in peaceful areas.

There are no official figures of the total death toll of this war but estimates from academics, local authorities and activists put the number of civilians, militants and security forces killed at well over 50,000.

Local rights activists say scores of civilians have been killed in successive air campaigns and ground operations by the military. They have been collecting video and documentary evidence to back up their claims.

These activists are linked to a prominent new rights campaign called the Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM) which emerged early last year and has since been publicising alleged rights abuses in the tribal region that victims had previously been too scared to report.

""It has taken us almost 15 years of suffering and humiliation to gather courage to speak up, and to spread awareness about how the military trampled our constitutional rights through both direct action and a policy of support for the militants,"" said Manzoor Pashteen, the top leader of the PTM.

But the group is under pressure. The PTM says 13 of its activists were killed on 26 May when the army opened fire on a large group of protesters in North Waziristan. The army said at least three activists were shot dead after a military checkpoint was attacked. The PTM denies this but two of its leaders, who also serve as MPs, have been arrested.

A number of cases highlighted by the PTM - and which the BBC investigated independently - were shared with a Pakistani military spokesman but he declined to respond, calling such allegations ""highly judgmental"".

There was no response to BBC requests for comment from the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, even though Mr Khan raised the issue of rights abuses in the tribal areas when he was an opposition politician.

How 9/11 put the Taliban into Pakistan

It all started with the al-Qaeda attacks in September 2001 in New York and Washington.

When the US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, the Taliban forces that had sheltered al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden melted away without a fight.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Armed Pakistani Taliban at a hideout in the tribal district of Orakzai in 2009

Pakistan, which was one of only three countries to have recognised the Taliban when they seized power in Kabul in 1996, had an interest in keeping the movement alive as part of its efforts to prevent Indian influence from spreading in Afghanistan.

So while Pakistan had been dependent on US military aid for decades and the then military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf had joined the US ""war on terror"", it also allowed the Taliban to carve out sanctuaries in Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal areas, notably the districts of North and South Waziristan.

But the Afghan Taliban did not cross the border alone. Militants from a complex array of different groups poured into the tribal region and some were far more hostile to the Pakistani state.

Jihadists with global ambitions also began plotting attacks from Waziristan, prompting demands from Washington that Pakistan do more to crush Islamist militancy.

As violence spread, Pakistan was caught ""between an inclination to fight militant forces and yet having to partner with some to strengthen its future bargaining position"", said Ayesha Siddiqa, a security analyst and author of the book Military Inc: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy.

In 2014, Pakistan launched a new operation in North Waziristan that increased pressure on militant groups and their safe havens and was credited with reducing attacks elsewhere in the country.

'The Taliban and the military are doing the same thing'

When the Taliban arrived in the tribal areas in 2001, they were given a cautious welcome by the local people. But this quickly turned into disillusionment when they started to take over tribal society by enforcing their strict religious codes.

During the first phase of that relationship, local youths joined the militants' ranks in their hundreds, thereby causing tribal rivalries to seep into the militant network. This was reflected in subsequent factional wars.

In the second stage, the Taliban embarked on a campaign to eliminate officially recognised tribal elders who were a hurdle in the way of the insurgents' drive to subjugate the tribes. At least 1,000 tribal elders have been killed by militants since 2002 and some estimates from non-governmental organisations put the figure at nearly 2,000.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Waziristan is rugged, inhospitable terrain - and closed to outsiders and journalists

One such assassination in North Waziristan in July 2007 is emblematic of how militants were able to subjugate the tribes.

""When they kidnapped and killed my brother, the tribe in our region was still strong, but because the military allowed [the militants] the freedom to move against our people, it broke our back,"" says Mohammad Amin, a Wazir tribesman from Razmak area of North Waziristan.

His brother's body was found dumped in an abandoned truck the day after he was kidnapped by militants. Mohammad Amin and other tribesmen were able to trace the attackers and confronted them. The ensuing gunfight left Mr Amin's son, Asadullah, a cousin and all four Taliban fighters dead.

Image caption Asadullah was shot dead by Taliban fighters trying to subdue his tribe

The tribe's subsequent calls on military officials in the garrison town of Razmak to curb Taliban violence were frustrated when militant leaders based in that very town threatened reprisal.

A decade on, Mr Amin is in no doubt that ""despite occasional clashes with each other, the Taliban and the military are doing the same thing"".

PTM activists have also documented several cases in which the security forces appear to have treated the local population brutally.

In May 2016, for example, an attack on a military post in the Teti Madakhel area of North Waziristan triggered a manhunt by troops who rounded up the entire population of a village.

An eyewitness who watched the operation from a wheat field nearby and whose brother was among those detained told the BBC that the soldiers beat everyone with batons and threw mud in children's mouths when they cried.

A pregnant woman was one of two people who died during torture, her son said in video testimony. At least one man remains missing.

Image caption Many tribal residents ended up in camps for displaced people in Peshawar and other places

The stories of survivors are painful too. I met Satarjan Mahsud in the town of Ramak, 100km (60 miles) further south down the Indus river from Dera Ismail Khan.

We sat inside a white tent and he told me his story over tea, with two young children at his side

One evening in April 2015 militants fired at a military post in Shaktoi, South Waziristan. Satarjan says troops responded by capturing suspects from a nearby village and shooting two of them dead.

Early the next morning, on 21 April, they extended their search across the valley to Satarjan's village where they found weapons stashed on a hill behind his house.

""The only people present in the house at that time were my brother Idarjan, his wife and two daughters-in-law,"" Satarjan says.

Image caption Satarjan has spent four years trying to trace his brother and nephews - to no avail

The soldiers knocked at the door. His brother answered and was immediately overpowered, tied up and blindfolded. The troops asked where other male members of the family were and rounded up Idarjan's four sons from elsewhere in the valley.

Witnesses later told Satarjan that the boys had been beaten, and his eldest nephew, Rezwarjan, received a lethal blow to the head.

All of them were thrown in the back of a pick-up truck which the soldiers had commandeered, and driven away to the army camp in the area.

The driver of the truck later told Satarjan that Rezwarjan was ""already half dead and couldn't hold himself in a sitting position, so the soldiers decided not to take him to the camp"".

He told Satarjan: ""They asked me to stop the truck, shot Rezwarjan in the head and threw his body on the road.""

Satarjan was working at a factory in Dubai at the time. He heard about what had happened and began the journey home. He took a flight, a bus and then walked for 15 hours to reach the village where Rezwarjan's body was found on 23 April.

Image caption People in the tribal areas have protested - but they are still waiting for justice

Locals there told him they hadn't been able to take the body across the valley to his family home because of a curfew, so they had buried it there on the hill.

He then walked across to his own village where he found his house deserted. The wives of Satarjan's brother and nephews had been taken in by relatives.

Satarjan knew the women wouldn't know the whole story because the curfew forbade travel between villages and there was no mobile network in the area.

When he met his sister-in-law, she told him what she knew: that her husband had been taken away by the army and that the younger men were missing.

""I was in two minds about whether to tell her. But then I thought it would be easier to give her the bad news about Rezwarjan once my brother and the boys had returned. I knew the army had nothing against them and would let them go soon.""

So he made up a story, telling her that when the army raided their house, the boys got away to safety in Karachi, far away in southern Pakistan. He assured her that her husband would soon be released.

On 26 April 2015, he moved the family to Ramak. Since then he's had no word from the military on the fate of his brother and three nephews. Weeks have turned into months, and months into years.

He is not alone. Local activists say more than 8,000 people picked up by the army since 2002 remain unaccounted for.

Meanwhile, Satarjan has been dodging questions from the women about why they can't visit their village.

""I tell them our house in Shaktoi has been demolished by the army, which is partly true. But the real reason is that if they go there, neighbours will come for condolences and they will find out.""

He says it would be better if he knew his brother and nephews had been jailed, or even killed. But not knowing anything is agony.

""I can't tell my sister-in-law her sons are missing, or dead. I can't tell the two young wives that they have been widowed,"" he says.

These individual stories are shocking but they are not unique. The PTM alleges that hundreds of people from the tribal areas could tell similar stories.

But they remain officially unacknowledged.

They are the consequences of a war Pakistan has gone to great lengths to hide from the world. This conflict on the Afghan border has for years been an information black hole.

And when the PTM broke through this chokehold last year, its media coverage was put under a comprehensive ban. Those in the media who have not heeded the ban have faced physical threats and financial pressure.

The military has openly called the PTM's patriotic credentials into question, accusing it of links to ""hostile"" intelligence agencies in Afghanistan and India.

And some PTM activists who were documenting cases of abuse and running the group's social media campaign have been jailed.

The treatment of the activists who are finally, after years of silence, raising the alarm on the abuses of a long and secret war suggests that those who have suffered in the conflict face an uphill battle for justice.","Adnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border.

It was early in 2014 when TV news networks trumpeted a major victory in the war against the Pakistani Taliban - the killing of one of the group's most senior commanders in a night-time air raid.

Adnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border.

Rasheed, a former Pakistan Air Force technician, was well-known. He had written an extraordinary letter to Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl and activist shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in 2012, attempting to justify why it had happened. He'd also been in prison for trying to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf - until he broke out.

Now it appeared that his luck had run out.

Quoting security officials, news channels reported on 22 January 2014 that Adnan Rasheed's hideout had been targeted two nights earlier in the Hamzoni area.

Waziristan and other parts of the vast mountainous tribal region have been controlled and locked-down by the Pakistani military since the US invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11, which saw Taliban fighters, al-Qaeda jihadists and other militants flee over the porous border.

Outsiders, including journalists, cannot get in - so verifying claims from the security forces is extremely difficult. Those who have reported stories from Waziristan that don't reflect well on the military have found themselves punished.

It turned out a year later that the jets had hit the wrong target - Rasheed confirmed this when he emerged in a video to prove he was alive.

Instead of taking out a top militant, Pakistan's military had actually killed the family of a local man who had his home blown to pieces.

The authorities have never acknowledged they made a mistake. The BBC travelled to Dera Ismail Khan, a town on the banks of the river Indus that is the gateway to the remote and forbidding tribal areas, to meet the man whose house was hit.

""It must have been 11pm or thereabouts,"" recalls Nazirullah, who was 20 at the time. He and his wife had recently married and had the rare privilege of a room to themselves. The rest of their large family slept in the only other room in their house in Khatei Kalay village.

""It was as if the house had exploded. My wife and I were shaken out of our sleep. There was a strong smell of gunpowder in the air. Both of us rushed to the door and stepped out, only to discover that the entire roof of our room had already collapsed, except a corner where our bed was.""

Image caption Nazirullah and his niece Sumayya survived but four members of the family were killed

The roof of the second room had also collapsed, and a fire was raging across the compound. Nazirullah heard cries from the rubble and, with his wife, frantically tried to help those they could see in the glow of the fire.

Neighbours helped them dig out the injured and the dead.

Four of Nazirullah's family died, including a three-year-old girl. His niece Sumayya, whose mother was among those killed, was then just a year old, and survived with a fractured hip. Another four members of the family were rescued from the rubble. All suffered fractures and other injuries.

Nazirullah's family has since moved back to Dera Ismail Khan, where life is more peaceful.

Like many others in this part of Pakistan, they have had to move several times to escape an insurgency that has been raging in the tribal areas for nearly two decades.

According to authorities and independent research groups, militant violence since 2002 has forced more than five million people in Pakistan's north-west to leave their homes to seek refuge either in government-run refugee camps or rented houses in peaceful areas.

There are no official figures of the total death toll of this war but estimates from academics, local authorities and activists put the number of civilians, militants and security forces killed at well over 50,000.

Local rights activists say scores of civilians have been killed in successive air campaigns and ground operations by the military. They have been collecting video and documentary evidence to back up their claims.

These activists are linked to a prominent new rights campaign called the Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM) which emerged early last year and has since been publicising alleged rights abuses in the tribal region that victims had previously been too scared to report.

""It has taken us almost 15 years of suffering and humiliation to gather courage to speak up, and to spread awareness about how the military trampled our constitutional rights through both direct action and a policy of support for the militants,"" said Manzoor Pashteen, the top leader of the PTM.

But the group is under pressure. The PTM says 13 of its activists were killed on 26 May when the army opened fire on a large group of protesters in North Waziristan. The army said at least three activists were shot dead after a military checkpoint was attacked. The PTM denies this but two of its leaders, who also serve as MPs, have been arrested.

A number of cases highlighted by the PTM - and which the BBC investigated independently - were shared with a Pakistani military spokesman but he declined to respond, calling such allegations ""highly judgmental"".

There was no response to BBC requests for comment from the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, even though Mr Khan raised the issue of rights abuses in the tribal areas when he was an opposition politician.

How 9/11 put the Taliban into Pakistan

It all started with the al-Qaeda attacks in September 2001 in New York and Washington.

When the US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, the Taliban forces that had sheltered al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden melted away without a fight.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Armed Pakistani Taliban at a hideout in the tribal district of Orakzai in 2009

Pakistan, which was one of only three countries to have recognised the Taliban when they seized power in Kabul in 1996, had an interest in keeping the movement alive as part of its efforts to prevent Indian influence from spreading in Afghanistan.

So while Pakistan had been dependent on US military aid for decades and the then military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf had joined the US ""war on terror"", it also allowed the Taliban to carve out sanctuaries in Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal areas, notably the districts of North and South Waziristan.

But the Afghan Taliban did not cross the border alone. Militants from a complex array of different groups poured into the tribal region and some were far more hostile to the Pakistani state.

Jihadists with global ambitions also began plotting attacks from Waziristan, prompting demands from Washington that Pakistan do more to crush Islamist militancy.

As violence spread, Pakistan was caught ""between an inclination to fight militant forces and yet having to partner with some to strengthen its future bargaining position"", said Ayesha Siddiqa, a security analyst and author of the book Military Inc: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy.

In 2014, Pakistan launched a new operation in North Waziristan that increased pressure on militant groups and their safe havens and was credited with reducing attacks elsewhere in the country.

'The Taliban and the military are doing the same thing'

When the Taliban arrived in the tribal areas in 2001, they were given a cautious welcome by the local people. But this quickly turned into disillusionment when they started to take over tribal society by enforcing their strict religious codes.

During the first phase of that relationship, local youths joined the militants' ranks in their hundreds, thereby causing tribal rivalries to seep into the militant network. This was reflected in subsequent factional wars.

In the second stage, the Taliban embarked on a campaign to eliminate officially recognised tribal elders who were a hurdle in the way of the insurgents' drive to subjugate the tribes. At least 1,000 tribal elders have been killed by militants since 2002 and some estimates from non-governmental organisations put the figure at nearly 2,000.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Waziristan is rugged, inhospitable terrain - and closed to outsiders and journalists

One such assassination in North Waziristan in July 2007 is emblematic of how militants were able to subjugate the tribes.

""When they kidnapped and killed my brother, the tribe in our region was still strong, but because the military allowed [the militants] the freedom to move against our people, it broke our back,"" says Mohammad Amin, a Wazir tribesman from Razmak area of North Waziristan.

His brother's body was found dumped in an abandoned truck the day after he was kidnapped by militants. Mohammad Amin and other tribesmen were able to trace the attackers and confronted them. The ensuing gunfight left Mr Amin's son, Asadullah, a cousin and all four Taliban fighters dead.

Image caption Asadullah was shot dead by Taliban fighters trying to subdue his tribe

The tribe's subsequent calls on military officials in the garrison town of Razmak to curb Taliban violence were frustrated when militant leaders based in that very town threatened reprisal.

A decade on, Mr Amin is in no doubt that ""despite occasional clashes with each other, the Taliban and the military are doing the same thing"".

PTM activists have also documented several cases in which the security forces appear to have treated the local population brutally.

In May 2016, for example, an attack on a military post in the Teti Madakhel area of North Waziristan triggered a manhunt by troops who rounded up the entire population of a village.

An eyewitness who watched the operation from a wheat field nearby and whose brother was among those detained told the BBC that the soldiers beat everyone with batons and threw mud in children's mouths when they cried.

A pregnant woman was one of two people who died during torture, her son said in video testimony. At least one man remains missing.

The stories of survivors are painful too. I met Satarjan Mahsud in the town of Ramak, 100km (60 miles) further south down the Indus river from Dera Ismail Khan.

We sat inside a white tent and he told me his story over tea, with two young children at his side

One evening in April 2015 militants fired at a military post in Shaktoi, South Waziristan. Satarjan says troops responded by capturing suspects from a nearby village and shooting two of them dead.

Early the next morning, on 21 April, they extended their search across the valley to Satarjan's village where they found weapons stashed on a hill behind his house.

""The only people present in the house at that time were my brother Idarjan, his wife and two daughters-in-law,"" Satarjan says.

Image caption Satarjan has spent four years trying to trace his brother and nephews - to no avail

The soldiers knocked at the door. His brother answered and was immediately overpowered, tied up and blindfolded. The troops asked where other male members of the family were and rounded up Idarjan's four sons from elsewhere in the valley.

Witnesses later told Satarjan that the boys had been beaten, and his eldest nephew, Rezwarjan, received a lethal blow to the head.

All of them were thrown in the back of a pick-up truck which the soldiers had commandeered, and driven away to the army camp in the area.

The driver of the truck later told Satarjan that Rezwarjan was ""already half dead and couldn't hold himself in a sitting position, so the soldiers decided not to take him to the camp"".

He told Satarjan: ""They asked me to stop the truck, shot Rezwarjan in the head and threw his body on the road.""

Satarjan was working at a factory in Dubai at the time. He heard about what had happened and began the journey home. He took a flight, a bus and then walked for 15 hours to reach the village where Rezwarjan's body was found on 23 April.

Image caption People in the tribal areas have protested - but they are still waiting for justice

Locals there told him they hadn't been able to take the body across the valley to his family home because of a curfew, so they had buried it there on the hill.

He then walked across to his own village where he found his house deserted. The wives of Satarjan's brother and nephews had been taken in by relatives.

Satarjan knew the women wouldn't know the whole story because the curfew forbade travel between villages and there was no mobile network in the area.

When he met his sister-in-law, she told him what she knew: that her husband had been taken away by the army and that the younger men were missing.

""I was in two minds about whether to tell her. But then I thought it would be easier to give her the bad news about Rezwarjan once my brother and the boys had returned. I knew the army had nothing against them and would let them go soon.""

So he made up a story, telling her that when the army raided their house, the boys got away to safety in Karachi, far away in southern Pakistan. He assured her that her husband would soon be released.

On 26 April 2015, he moved the family to Ramak. Since then he's had no word from the military on the fate of his brother and three nephews. Weeks have turned into months, and months into years.

He is not alone. Local activists say more than 8,000 people picked up by the army since 2002 remain unaccounted for.

Meanwhile, Satarjan has been dodging questions from the women about why they can't visit their village.

""I tell them our house in Shaktoi has been demolished by the army, which is partly true. But the real reason is that if they go there, neighbours will come for condolences and they will find out.""

He says it would be better if he knew his brother and nephews had been jailed, or even killed. But not knowing anything is agony.

""I can't tell my sister-in-law her sons are missing, or dead. I can't tell the two young wives that they have been widowed,"" he says.

More from Ilyas in Pakistan

These individual stories are shocking but they are not unique. The PTM alleges that hundreds of people from the tribal areas could tell similar stories.

But they remain officially unacknowledged.

They are the consequences of a war Pakistan has gone to great lengths to hide from the world. This conflict on the Afghan border has for years been an information black hole.

And when the PTM broke through this chokehold last year, its media coverage was put under a comprehensive ban. Those in the media who have not heeded the ban have faced physical threats and financial pressure.

The military has openly called the PTM's patriotic credentials into question, accusing it of links to ""hostile"" intelligence agencies in Afghanistan and India.

And some PTM activists who were documenting cases of abuse and running the group's social media campaign have been jailed.

The treatment of the activists who are finally, after years of silence, raising the alarm on the abuses of a long and secret war suggests that those who have suffered in the conflict face an uphill battle for justice.","Adnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border.

22,Canadian national inquiry: Giving a voice to missing and murdered women,Jessica Murphy,"Image copyright LightRocket Image caption A poster commemorates Tina Fontaine, a young indigenous girl who was killed in 2014

After over two years of work, Canada's inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women has concluded and the report reached the public domain. We spoke to two of the women who fought for years to bring global attention to the violence.

It has been almost 50 years since Helen Betty Osborne - a Cree woman who dreamed of becoming a teacher - was abducted and brutally murdered near The Pas, Manitoba, a town deeply divided along racial lines, its white and indigenous residents once described as ""world's apart"".

In many ways, the death of the 19-year-old was indicative of cases to come - an indigenous teenager forced to leave her remote community, targeted by four men simply because of her race, and a family's long wait for justice.

Fifteen years ago, Amnesty International called the assault and murder of the shy young woman ""an unheeded warning"".

The violence faced by indigenous women and girls is now in the spotlight as a national inquiry into missing and murdered women drew to a close after more than two years of hearings and testimony.

""It took 40 years to get to this present moment and only because indigenous women have been on the ground making noise about this,"" said Robyn Bourgeois, an academic and activist who researches female indigenous activism in Canada. ""Without them we wouldn't be here,"" she said.

The campaigners include family members victims who have campaigned tirelessly for their lost loved ones, and grassroots organisers and activists like Beverley Jacobs and Terri Brown, who also lost family members.

For Jacobs, the murder of her 21-year-old cousin Tashina General in 2008 was a turning point in her work. For Brown, whose 41-year-old sister, Ada Elaine, died in 2001, the loss continues to haunt the family, who say she was murdered and that her case was mishandled.

Jacobs, a Mohawk lawyer, was the lead researcher of the Amnesty report into discrimination and violence against indigenous women, and spent months travelling across the country meeting the families of women who had disappeared or been killed.

""At the time it was the families doing all the work,"" she said. ""They were the ones doing the poster boards, and the searches, having a really difficult time with police, just not getting any answers.""

Her endeavour began just as a related, horrific murder case was about to make headlines around the world.

Police had arrested Robert Pickton, a serial killer who had been preying on women from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside district for years - many of his victims indigenous, many of them marginalised.

Authorities had long denied there was a pattern to the disappearances, or that they might be linked.

A subsequent provincial inquiry laid bare the systemic failure and bias that allowed Pickton to murder women for years without being caught.

Pickton was eventually sentenced to life in prison for the murder of six women. He had initially being charged with killing 26 women from a total of 69 who had gone missing throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

His high-profile trial brought with it a growing suspicion among campaigners like Jacobs that what had happened in British Columbia, where indigenous women were disproportionately reflected among women reported missing or killed, would be seen on a national level.

""That [case] was a leverage point,"" Bourgeois said.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Many of Pickton's victims were from Canada's marginalised indigenous community

It was also where Jacobs, the Mohawk lawyer, began her work. ""The first task I thought I needed to do was to go to the Downtown Eastside because Pickton had just been arrested,"" she said.

Women who had been working for years to bring attention to what was happening brought her to the killer's pig farm, the site of the murders.

""It was horrible. It was before any trial, I'm not sure if any charges were laid yet. But [investigators] were digging up the ground,"" Jacobs said.

'Possibly disbelief, possible fear'

Brown, a long-time indigenous activist and, like Jacobs, a former president of the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC), was instrumental in raising the alarm about the ""horrific number of women"" who were disappearing in Vancouver.

Under Brown's leadership, NWAC collaborated groups like with Amnesty, Kairos - a faith-based group - and the Anglican and United churches to create a national awareness campaign.

But Brown says it was a repeat of Vancouver - they were most often met with indifference. There were also significant gaps in record-keeping, making it difficult to gain a full picture of the violence.

Some unofficial accounting of the missing was taking place. In Toronto, Amber O'Hara - an Anishinaabe woman and Aids campaigner - began compiling an online database. And according to Brown, women in the Downtown Eastside ""were doing great work, they were keeping count of the women who were being lost"".

""Families would come in and say 'We haven't seen her for weeks.' And police would say 'Maybe she's on vacation somewhere'. Well excuse me, they never left that 100 block of the Eastside.""

Brown, then heading the Native Women's Association of Canada, decided there needed to be a formal compiling of the data.

""I wanted to put numbers to this because no one believed us,"" she recalled. ""But we didn't have the resources, I did my own research and presented it but they said: 'Well, how do you know that it's true?' At that point we said there were about 500 missing and murdered aboriginal women.""

Image copyright Toronto Star Image caption People at a rally in Toronto in 2014 demanding a national inquiry

The association secured federal funds to found the Sisters in Spirit campaign, which researched and raised awareness of the high rates of violence against indigenous women. By 2009, they had compiled 520 names.

Still, Brown remembered bringing the statistics to meetings with government officials - even some indigenous leadership, she said - and it was ""the strangest thing"" to present the data, ""to people who would just sit there and look at you, not respond, not say anything, not be encouraging, not be giving of their support in anyway"".

""Blank. Possibly disbelief, possible fear. I don't know.""

The statistics

To this day, a lack of hard data means no one knows exactly how many indigenous women and girls have been murdered or have gone missing in the past decades. But some statistics have been compiled.

10% of all women reported missing are indigenous and they account for 21% of female homicide victims. Indigenous Canadians represent about 4% of the population.

Half of the homicides were committed by a family member, but indigenous women are also 1.4 times more likely to be killed by someone they aren't close to.

In 2014, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified almost 1,200 cases between 1980 and 2012.

Indigenous women are at a greater risk of physical and sexual assault - even when other risk factors are taken into account - and experience more violence from their intimate partners.

Bourgeois and Jacobs tried a different tack. They went to the international stage. Brown began to raise the issue at UN meetings and elsewhere.

""Everywhere I went I would mention it,"" she said. ""Not that anyone cared. But I thought at some point someone is going to listen.""

Jacobs said they knew Canada wasn't doing anything. ""And we knew that the international forums would bring the attention against Canada,"" she said. ""[On the international level] there are no enforcement mechanisms. The only way is to bring embarrassment to the country.""

Image copyright Handout Image caption Tina Fontaine died in August 2014, aged just 15

Then in August 2014, 43 years after Osborne's murder, another case - this time the death of a 15-year-old schoolgirl called Tina Fontaine - began to make headlines across Canada.

Her murder sparked a collective and fierce outrage and consolidated calls for a national inquiry.

By 2015, the UN was pushing for a public inquiry, as did a landmark Canadian report into reconciliation with indigenous peoples.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau officially launched one a year after winning the 2015 general election.

By then, Brown and Jacobs had stepped away from national advocacy on the issue. Both say it took its toll emotionally, especially given that both had themselves lost loved ones.

""I felt I couldn't do it anymore. I got too angry,"" said Jacobs. ""From the time I started to [after my cousin's death] I just felt I was banging my head against the wall, I felt like nothing was getting achieved.""

They have also been critical of the inquiry itself. Jacobs said it never managed to truly gain the trust of many families who lost sisters or mothers or daughters, and many were not included in the public hearings.

According to Brown, ""They talked to a lot of families, opened a lot of wounds. But in the end did anybody get arrested?

""There has to be justice. Those men have to go to jail. If they don't, all the money spent and all what we talk about is not worth it, because there's no justice.""

They also warned that, while the inquiry may have finished, rates of violence remained high.

True healing would come from indigenous Canadians reclaiming their culture, language, and traditions, Jacobs said.

She said Canada must take concrete steps towards reconciliation and taking responsibility for policies - from residential schooling, to the child welfare system and longstanding issues around land and treaties and more - that have been harmful to indigenous women.

These days, Brown shows up for vigils organised for the missing women and goes recognised, she said.

""Some young woman, inevitably at some point, will come up and start educating me on the issue and I just think, 'Yes, there's hope for us now.'

""Because they know the issue, They can name the issue, they have the strength to speak about it.""

The final report

The path to the release of the national inquiry's final report hasn't always been smooth.

The C$92m ($68m; £53m) inquiry was launched in 2016 with a mandate to take an in-depth look into the underlying social, economic, cultural, institutional, and historical causes of violence against indigenous women and girls.

It held 24 hearings and ""statement gathering"" events across Canada, taking testimony from almost 1,500 people, including family members of missing or murdered women and survivors of violence. It also heard from dozens of experts and reviewed police and institutional files.

There have been resignations, delays, criticism related to transparency and communications, and concerns over its scope. Commissioners fought for a two-year extension but received just an extra six months from the federal government.","The violence faced by indigenous women and girls is now in the spotlight as a national inquiry into missing and murdered women drew to a close after more than two years of hearings and testimony.

Jacobs said they knew Canada wasn't doing anything. ""And we knew that the international forums would bring the attention against Canada,"" she said. ""[On the international level] there are no enforcement mechanisms. The only way is to bring embarrassment to the country.""

Then in August 2014, 43 years after Osborne's murder, another case - this time the death of a 15-year-old schoolgirl called Tina Fontaine - began to make headlines across Canada.

Her murder sparked a collective and fierce outrage and consolidated calls for a national inquiry.

By 2015, the UN was pushing for a public inquiry, as did a landmark Canadian report into reconciliation with indigenous peoples.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau officially launched one a year after winning the 2015 general election.

By then, Brown and Jacobs had stepped away from national advocacy on the issue. Both say it took its toll emotionally, especially given that both had themselves lost loved ones.

""I felt I couldn't do it anymore. I got too angry,"" said Jacobs. ""From the time I started to [after my cousin's death] I just felt I was banging my head against the wall, I felt like nothing was getting achieved.""

They have also been critical of the inquiry itself. Jacobs said it never managed to truly gain the trust of many families who lost sisters or mothers or daughters, and many were not included in the public hearings.

According to Brown, ""They talked to a lot of families, opened a lot of wounds. But in the end did anybody get arrested?

""There has to be justice. Those men have to go to jail. If they don't, all the money spent and all what we talk about is not worth it, because there's no justice.""

They also warned that, while the inquiry may have finished, rates of violence remained high.

True healing would come from indigenous Canadians reclaiming their culture, language, and traditions, Jacobs said.

She said Canada must take concrete steps towards reconciliation and taking responsibility for policies - from residential schooling, to the child welfare system and longstanding issues around land and treaties and more - that have been harmful to indigenous women.

These days, Brown shows up for vigils organised for the missing women and goes recognised, she said.

""Some young woman, inevitably at some point, will come up and start educating me on the issue and I just think, 'Yes, there's hope for us now.'

""Because they know the issue, They can name the issue, they have the strength to speak about it.""

The final report

The path to the release of the national inquiry's final report hasn't always been smooth.

The C$92m ($68m; £53m) inquiry was launched in 2016 with a mandate to take an in-depth look into the underlying social, economic, cultural, institutional, and historical causes of violence against indigenous women and girls.

It held 24 hearings and ""statement gathering"" events across Canada, taking testimony from almost 1,500 people, including family members of missing or murdered women and survivors of violence. It also heard from dozens of experts and reviewed police and institutional files.

There have been resignations, delays, criticism related to transparency and communications, and concerns over its scope. Commissioners fought for a two-year extension but received just an extra six months from the federal government.","The violence faced by indigenous women and girls is now in the spotlight as a national inquiry into missing and murdered women drew to a close after more than two years of hearings and testimony.
A subsequent provincial inquiry laid bare the systemic failure and bias that allowed Pickton to murder women for years without being caught.
And according to Brown, women in the Downtown Eastside ""were doing great work, they were keeping count of the women who were being lost"".

24,A mentalist’s guide to being happy,David Robson,"Imagine that you are standing on one side of a river, and you want to reach a village on the other side.

You have a group of cheerleaders behind you, egging you on. So you set off, full of determination. But you have forgotten to take the river’s current into account – and no matter how hard you strain your muscles, you can’t quite overcome it. By the time you reach the other bank, you have been pulled far from the place you intended to be.

We may not like to admit it, but our life follows a similar trajectory – as forces beyond our control drag us from our chosen path. And the importance of recognising this fact is just one of the many lessons I learnt from Derren Brown, the illusionist, ""mentalist"" (mind-reader) and writer, whose book Happy explores the philosophy and psychology of wellbeing.

Most self-help books would suggest that you can fight life’s currents with determination and positive thinking. But taking inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman philosophers like the Stoics and 19th Century German thinker Arthur Schopenhauer, as well as modern scientific research, Brown believes that this is simply a recipe for disappointment and frustration. “We’re better off making our peace with the fact that that is the dynamic of life – rather than creating a false idea that we can somehow control everything to bring it in line with what our goals are,” he says.

As part of BBC Reel’s new Rethink series, I sat down with Brown to discuss the inspiration for his book and the reasons that ancient philosophy is essential to cope with the peculiar demands of the 21st Century.

The concept of Happy might seem like a departure from Brown’s well-known stage shows and TV programmes, but he points out that his illusions have often played with the mind’s blindspots. “Magic is a great analogy for how we edit our experiences.”

How so? Magicians, he says, try to tell a convincing narrative that dismisses certain inconvenient facts – and that’s exactly what the brain does as it compiles our life story. “It took me a long time to realise that. When I did realise that, I saw that magic wasn’t just this childish way of trying to impress people, but actually it sort of held a clue as to how we how we process reality and therefore might better live in accordance with it.”

You might tell yourself that you’re an awkward misfit, for instance – and so you only remember the times when you acted embarrassingly. Or you might only ever pick bad relationships, because your overarching story is that you are “unlucky in love”.

A lot of the narratives we inherit come from when we’re really small, from our parents, who have their own set of frustrations, their own unlived lives – Derren Brown

We often adopt these stories from a young age, he says. “A lot of the narratives we inherit come from when we’re really small, from our parents, who have their own set of frustrations – their own unlived lives,” he says. “And for better or worse, we take all that on board and we go out in the world thinking that maybe we have to be successful to be loved, or that we have to always put other people’s needs first, or that we have some big secret that we couldn’t possibly tell people.” Recognising the sources of these narratives can go some way to reducing our anxiety and unhappiness, Brown says. (For more on the power of storytelling to shape our health and happiness, see our recent in-depth story on the subject.)

Today, the stories that we tell ourselves may also be shaped by the self-help industry’s promotion of positive thinking, determination and self-belief. While it might initially feel empowering to see ourselves as the beleaguered hero who relentlessly pursues their goals through sheer willpower, Brown argues that for most people, it will only lead to disappointment. (In Happy, Brown is particularly scathing of Rhonda Byrne's The Secret.)

One problem is that we often aren’t very good at choosing the right goals. “We have a terrible understanding of what fulfils us.” Many people set their sights on money, for instance – but psychological research has shown that, beyond the certain level of wealth needed for basic comfort, riches do not bring greater happiness.

View BBC Reel’s video of Derren Brown explaining the downsides of relentless optimism, and the difference between the “experiencing self” and the “remembering self”

If you’re not convinced, Brown suggests the following thought experiment: imagine that you woke up one day to discover that you were the only person left living on Earth. With no one else around, you’d be able to go and live in any house you wanted – Buckingham Palace even. But would you want to? “You would probably find somewhere that was just comfortable and practical.” The same goes for your expensive clothes, fancy cars, or the latest technology. “When you really follow that thought through, it’s amazing how much we acquire and want only to impress other people.”

Even if we do choose the right goals, the positive-thinking movement can place too much responsibility on the individual; if we haven’t succeeded, it’s our own fault for not having wanted it enough. Worse still, the kind of inflated personal belief that is promoted by certain gurus may cause us to ignore the criticisms of those around us, even when they might be offering a more realistic view of our chances.

Ultimately, the success stories we hear are the anomalies. Just think of all the motivational autobiographies out there: all giving the impression that determination was the key to success. “You just never read the biographies of businessmen who have failed,” he says – yet there will be many out there who had all the self-belief, but just never managed to make it. After all, as many as nine out of ten start-ups end up bombing.

Brown, of course, isn’t arguing that we should simply give up on our dreams. But if we return to that idea of the swimmer crossing from one bank to the other, it’s no good ignoring the currents pushing against us or believing that our force of will alone will overturn them – it is inevitable that you are going to be dragged off course.

If positive thinking can’t make us happier, what can? Brown argues that a healthier attitude to life comes from the Stoics, the ancient Greek philosophers who argued that we should actively and deliberately distinguish between the things that are within your power to change, and the things that aren’t – which we should learn to accept as a necessary part of life.

“I find myself doing this a lot that when something’s really bothering and frustrating me. I just think which side of the line is it on? Is it my thoughts and actions? Or is it something out there? It’s always something out there, it’s someone else’s behaviour. So then I think well, what if it was fine that that person is an idiot, or that my partner can’t handle stress well, or something like that – things that kind of end up having an effect on me, but actually, what if it’s fine, that that’s just their thing? It’s a very helpful thought, because then you take all the stress off yourself. You can then still work out how to help that person if you want, if that’s appropriate, but you kind of emotionally just disconnect from the pain of it.”

He gives an example of a game of tennis, but he says that same applies to any major challenge. “If you go into the game thinking ‘I must win’, that's out of your control. So if you start to lose, you feel like you're failing and then you become anxious… But if you go into a game of tennis thinking ‘I'll play as well as I possibly can to the best of my ability’ – that is under your control, and it doesn't matter if you start to lose – you won’t feel the frustration of failure, because you’re not failing, you’re still sticking true to your goals.”

Similarly, you can go into a job interview with the full knowledge that even if you perform your absolute best, the employer’s final decision is still beyond your control, and you can afford yourself a little compassion if you don’t make it. Brown says that this lowers our emotional “centre of gravity”, making us more resilient to life’s challenges. “[The Stoic’s] model of happiness was about avoiding disturbance.”

Brown also advocates the Stoic practice of premeditation every morning to prepare the mind for the day ahead. “It is, quite simply, spending a few minutes every morning, thinking about the day that lies ahead, and what the kind of traps are likely to be where you’re likely to let yourself down, and just anticipating them and thinking them through,” he says. This deliberate self-reflection – taken from a distanced perspective, when we are in a more rational frame of mind – reminds us that some things will be out of our control, and need not be the source of upset. At the same time it helps us to navigate the challenges that are within our control more wisely, so that we don’t just make the same mistakes again and again.

One of the best ways of achieving this, he says, is to leave the phone out of the bedroom. “It’s a little reminder that okay, instead of just browsing Twitter, I’ll think about what’s going to happen today and how I can meet those things in a more useful way.”

This media cannot be played on your device.

View BBC Reel's video on stoicism.

A sceptic might question whether these ancient philosophies can be relevant in today’s turbulent times, but Brown argues that it is just as relevant today as ever before. “The Stoics appear during a huge time of constant wars and real political strife. And it became very popular, I think, because it’s a way of distancing yourself from strife and keeping your centre of gravity within you.” He emphasises that this is not an excuse to remain passive or apathetic – it simply helps you to find some personal peace in the turmoil, and some perspective in the battles we do choose to fight, rather than resorting to outrage in every disagreement.

The more detached approach might also help us to deal with the trials of social media and to remember that the truth of someone’s private life is often very different from the perfect exterior we present to the world. “It must be very difficult growing up, when that [social media] is really all you know, and you’re comparing that to this sort of horrible, ugly, messy version of yourself that you know, exists,” he says. “It’s hard to remember that everybody else has one of those as well.”

With that in mind, I wonder how much we are simply seeing a public facade of Brown himself. But as far as you can tell from our short conversation, the Stoic approach of accepting our lack of control certainly seems to bring him moments of relief in his hectic life.

“It’s like that feeling when you’re a kid and you think you’ve got to get up for school and you realise it’s a Saturday,” he says. And that’s the kind of contentment that we could all hope to achieve.

25,The danger of overusing exclamation marks,Emily Torres,"Hi! Hope you’re well! Great to hear from you!

I’m well-known for my cheerfulness. Even on my worst days, I put on a happy face to communicate with people outside my immediate friends and colleagues. In my emails, this behaviour manifests itself as exclamation marks.

Preoccupied with appearing nice, I used to catch myself using exclamations at the end of every other sentence. And I’m not ashamed to admit it because, chances are, you’ve sent those emails too.

Take a look at the last few messages you sent. If you’re like me, you’ll see exclamations and other niceties peppered throughout: “Looking forward to seeing the end result!” and “I’m excited to hear from you!” and “I’m happy to help out!”

But are you?

Whether you send off a few – or a few dozen – emails a day, you’re making these micro-decisions about how to accommodate your recipient when you address, punctuate, and clarify your ideas in real time. And this is where decades of conditioning creep in, and that anxiety-driven need to be liked emerges.

Especially for women, who use exclamation marks more often than men do. In a 2006 study, researchers analysed 200 exclamations used in professional discussion groups, and found that females used 73% of the exclamation marks. The study concluded that women use these marks more often than men do in order to convey friendliness in their professional interactions.

For me, the scourge of the exclamation mark is this: I use it excessively because of the pressure I feel to manage the recipient’s feelings. My default tone is enthusiastic, even when the situation doesn’t call for it.

Being kind

Women tend to overemphasise our kindness at work, and not without good reason. According to McKinsey’s 2018 Women in the Workplace report, we are still less likely to be hired in or promoted to senior positions, and there’s pressure to provide more evidence of our competence than our male colleagues. And, unsurprising to many women, we’re more likely to have our judgement questioned in our area of expertise.

Is this why I overcompensate with enthusiasm?

I fear that I won’t get what I want or need, so I soften my tone and emphasise my interest. I add a layer of friendliness because I don’t want to be perceived as cold. Each unnecessary exclamation mark is a little request to my recipient to please like me, and please say yes.

This goes beyond my emails, too. In mixed company, I’m not always the loudest voice in the room and I used to be hesitant to interject. I used to fear speaking up and standing up for my ideas and expertise in an effort to let others take the credit they demanded. That meant my contributions went unshared in the name of politeness.

Women have been conditioned to be kind, supportive, and to not take up space – and it’s draining.

Time sink

When I started paring back my punctuation, I noticed how that same inauthentic enthusiasm was showing up in my day-to-day. I discovered that the time I spend adjusting my tone takes a toll on my energy.

Managing other people’s feelings is exhausting. And what’s worse, it’s unnecessary.

The reality is, I’m not always excited to hear from someone I don’t know. And I’m not always happy to help, because I have my own work to do. Expelling this energy in order to be accommodating of others drains me of energy I could use for my own creative projects and professional pursuits.

I’ve realised all of this grammatical enthusiasm begins to indicate an open-door policy. Sure, people will think I’m nice, but what am I sacrificing in the process?

It’s not just the punctuations – it’s the way I speak in meetings. It’s the way I agree to things when I’d rather object. It’s the way I set (and do not set) boundaries for my own time. When I accommodate others in a way that puts my own needs and projects second, I am failing myself and my team.

Not the default

As I’ve learned to rein in my punctuation, I’ve discovered that I can masterfully use exclamation marks as a relational tool rather than a coping mechanism. Like a well-placed smile, a thoughtful exclamation connects me to the people I communicate with, whether it’s my closest friend or a cold email to a stranger.

Instead of overusing niceties, I let my words lead. I use exclamations sparingly, and only when it feels honest and authentic – not when it’s coming from a place of insecurity. If I need to make the right impression, there are plenty of ways to build an emotional connection beyond punctuation. Instead, I opt for substance over superfluous style, like complimenting someone’s recent work, or sending an article they’ll enjoy.

Now, I ruthlessly replace unnecessary exclamation marks with full stops. Full stops slow down my pace. They offer a firmness that says I know what I’m talking about, and that I know exactly what I want.

This also challenges me to manage my inbox more thoughtfully: I protect my time by reflecting on whether I do need to send a response, and why. If I don’t feel the email will add substance, or further a relationship, I don’t write it.

I’ve found my verbal communications have become firmer as well. When I’m not feeling confident, I sometimes use upspeak, or ending statements with the inflection of a question. I frame my needs as questions rather than directives, and it’s time to start putting full stops here, too. We don’t have to ask nicely for our opinions to be considered; our thoughts and contributions are valid and worth taking up space.

I’m removing the mask of punctuation that drains my energy, and drawing a hard line to protect my time and energy. And sometimes, I’ll exclaim.

Because an exclamation mark, like kindness, is a valuable resource. And I will use it properly. Full stop.

26,The surprising story of the Basque language,Justin Calderon,"A few steps from the entrance to the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, one of San Sebastian’s most visible landmarks with its sky-piercing gothic spire, lies a simple, two-faced earthen slab. In this corner of Spain’s Basque Country, it seems out of place: carved on one side with an Apostolic cross and on the other with a mysterious-looking, non-Latin alphabet.

The letters are certainly not Euskara, also known as Basque, an enigmatic European language famous for the absence of any clear links to living linguistic relatives. Rather, this Armenian khachkar (a cross-bearing memorial stele) was placed in central San Sebastian in 2017 by the city’s modern Armenian community to commemorate the centennial of the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks, which the Basque Country parliament is one of five parliaments in Spain to officially recognise.

There is a surprising reason for the camaraderie between these two small and distant ethnic groups that are from opposite sides of Europe. Though their languages indicate no superficial resemblance – even the scripts look comparatively alien to one another – they share a baffling litany of words and grammatical elements that are acknowledged by both Armenian and Basque scholars.

When I first saw the Armenian khachkar, I had just arrived from Biarritz in French Basque Country, where the Association AgurArménie (Armenian-Basque association) similarly trumpets a strong friendship between the two ostensibly distinct groups. What’s more, as I clumsily rolled past the memorial with suitcase in hand, I noted that San Sebastian’s khachkar looked familiar. In the Basque Museum in Bayonne, a short distance inland from Biarritz, I’d seen medieval Basque funerary steles that bore artistic motifs with striking similarities to the one in San Sebastian.

You may also be interested in:

• The language the French forbade

• Switzerland’s ‘secret’ fifth language

• The French region with a new currency

Was this just coincidence? Many Armenians believe these similarities are not. Contrary to the popular belief that Basques are a cultural island, the Armenia-origin theory claims linguistic, toponymic, mythological and even DNA links between Armenians and Basques. Though this theory goes back centuries, it was most recently reinvigorated by Armenian linguist Vahan Sargsyan, who published numerous books and studies on the subject, including a first-ever Armenian-Basque dictionary in 2001.

It’s a topic not without controversy. The dominantly upheld theory by many Basques, including on their government tourism site, is that their ethno-linguistic origin is isolated. This means their language and DNA are unique – and is thought to derive directly from hunter-gathers who came to this area long before Neolithic farming entered the region 7,500 years ago.

However, in 2015, DNA testing by population geneticist Mattias Jakobsson of Uppsala University in Sweden put a dent into this theory when his team found strong DNA matches between skeletons of Neolithic Iberian farmers, which date to 5,500 to 3,500 years ago, and modern day Basques, according to Science Magazine. But the discovery hasn’t brought closure. The researchers also conceded that they couldn’t “entirely rule out the possibility that Basque still has its origins in a hunter-gatherer language that was retained and carried along as farming spread throughout Iberia” – which leaves the mystery unsolved.

What makes the Armenian-Basque theory intriguing is that it has long been supported by linguistic research, first in an article by British Basque linguist Edward Spencer Dodgson in 1884, and then by studies from German philologist Joseph Karst in 1928, who discovered more than 300 Basque-Armenian lexical, grammatical and phonetic matches, including tegi (place), and zat (separate in Basque)/zati (separate in Armenian).

More contemporarily, Sargsyan’s collaborative work in 1998 with Armenian and Basque linguists identified almost 600-shared parallel words between the two languages, which Sargsyan suggested were introduced through metallurgy and farming via an ancient migration of Armenians to this area. “It’s no accident that the Armenian and Basque languages have a number of almost identical words relating to agriculture,” he wrote in a 2006 article in Yerevan Magazine, referring to the shared words ardi (sheep), urti (water-bearing) and gari (millet in Euskara; barley in Armenian).

I was curious to test out the Armenian-Basque lexicon to see if it was mutually intelligible, so I set out to question Euskara speakers on both sides of the Spanish-French border.

From Bayonne to Bilbao, the Basque region, as seen from several train seats, is a land of brilliant greenery that traverses thick beds of grass and misty mountaintops. It is this land that provided for early Basque pastoralists, and its long coastline for fishermen, both of which are traditions still upheld strongly today. While 90% of Spaniards live in big cities, making the country one of the most depopulated in Europe, contrarily the majority of the Spanish Basque Country’s more than two million people still live a rural or suburban lifestyle.

This strong anchor to village life has created numerous dialects, and in Basque public schools and institutions, a standardised Euskara, called batua, is employed.

I showed Manex Otegi, a San Sebastian native I met through my holiday rental, a list of 26 shared Armenian-Basque words from Sargsyan’s compilation. “It is Basque, but it’s a bit weird; it seems to be really old,” he said, referring to the list. “Only six words on this list are batua,” he added, pointing out the Armenian-Basque words zati (separate) and txar (evil). “I’m not sure where they [others] come from and I guess that the ones that I’m not familiar with is because they are very old and maybe have been lost because the lack of use over the years and small population.”

I repeated the same questioning with some Armenian friends in Bayonne, who recognised just one word on the list, the word for sheep (ardi), as an antiquated Armenian word.

Gauging from conversations on trains and pintxo bars, and later with academics, it seems most shared Armenian-Basque words are obsolete and no longer part of either modern language.

Unfortunately, there are no known living speakers fluent in both languages, and Sargsyan, who was self-taught in Euskara, passed away after a sudden heart attack in 2011 at the age of 54. According to his daughter Arevik, he left behind hundreds of flash cards of additional shared words, which have yet to be published.

But how did two isolated ethno-linguistic cultures share so many words with one another? Multiple academics – both Armenian and Basque – including Basque linguist Charles Videgain, kept pointing me to Bilbao, where the Euskaltzaindia (Royal Academy of the Basque Language) is located, to speak with the preeminent minds on the history of the Basque language.

In Bilbao, however, every scholar I spoke with officially rejected any link between Basques and peoples from the Caucasus (including Armenians or Georgians). Xabier Kintana, head director at the Euskaltzaindia, told me that Sargsyan’s list of shared Armenian-Basque words “are taken very randomly from the different modern dialects of the Basque language” and “are surely old loans of Latin, Celtic and other languages, in their time neighbours of the Basque, which invalidates their comparison.”

He insisted that in order for such a study to successfully find a shared origin, comparisons would need to be made between the ancient forms of both languages. This would strip away borrowings from other languages, both in the Basque case (Latin, Iberian, Celtiberian, etc) and Armenian (Arabic, Turkish, Syriac, etc). However, comparing ancient languages depends on often very tiny sample sizes from archaeological digs, meaning getting a complete picture is often impossible.

Even if a language connection is found, ultimately solid physical evidence linking the two peoples is absent. “The only relationship between these peoples is the similarity of some words,” Basque archaeologist Mertxe Urteaga told me. “There is no [archaeological] proof of the Armenian presence in the Basque Country and Navarra.”

That left me back where I started, unable to find proof of a link between the two ethnic groups, yet still not convinced that two languages sharing hundreds of words could be pure coincidence.

For now, it seems that Basque’s genesis story remains one of Europe’s greatest enigmas; a rare treasure of discovery in a world already largely charted, waiting for someone to finally crack it open.

27,Film review: X-Men Dark Phoenix,Caryn James,"“Who are we?” wonders Jean Grey – the telepathic, telekinetic, soul-searching heroine of Dark Phoenix – in the film’s opening voiceover. Any telepath around could have looked into her mind and answered: “Well, you’re not someone interesting.” This latest instalment in the X-Men franchise is flatter than a wafer-thin page of the comic books that inspired it. The film is done in by a drab script and a surprisingly dull Sophie Turner, whose performance as Jean, aka Phoenix, supposedly in emotional turbulence as she sorts out whether to use her powers for good or evil, has none of the wiliness and depth Turner displayed as Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones.

Dark Phoenix is especially disappointing because the X-Men series has always been the smartest, most sophisticated of today’s action-hero movies. That difference is largely thanks to James McAvoy’s cerebral Professor Charles Xavier, whose mind-control abilities make mental powers seem dynamic, and Michael Fassbender’s Erik Lehnsherr, who becomes Magneto. His haunted past drives his thoughts, and his ability to move giant chunks of metal.

Charles and Magneto are in Dark Phoenix, along with other familiar characters. They include Jennifer Lawrence as the shape-shifting Raven, who tries to be a mentor to Jean. Nicholas Hoult is Hank or the Beast – sometimes looking human, sometimes blue and hairy. Tye Sheridan is Jean’s boyfriend, Scott, who can shoot powerful beams out of his eyes. But these characters seem to walk through the script, without the visceral connections that have made them a team – often split by rivalry – in the past.

It’s surprising that such a promising, character-driven premise never takes off

The story arc is so straightforward it’s hardly an arc at all. After a quick flashback to a trauma in Jean’s girlhood, which led her to Xavier’s school for powerful mutants (as it should properly be called), the plot picks up in 1992, a decade after the events of X-Men Apocalypse. The X-Men are launched into space to save a damaged US space shuttle, and while the mission succeeds there’s a nasty side effect. Jean absorbs solar flares that enhance her dark energy, making her the most powerful of mutants. For the rest of the film she struggles with how ‘good Jean’ can prevent ‘bad Jean’ from taking control and killing people.

In an early scene, evil Jean tosses police cars in the air, smashes houses and kills a beloved major character – at least for now. Who really stays dead in action-hero sagas? Their landscapes are now littered with more formerly-dead characters than most zombie movies. The X-Men, ever philosophical, are split between wanting to save Jean from herself, or destroy her for the good of the world.

It’s surprising that such a promising, character-driven premise never takes off, because the film was directed and written by Simon Kinberg, who has had a role producing or writing the X-Men films since The Last Stand in 2006. As a director, he lacks a flair for working with actors. Jessica Chastain is wasted in her role as an alien named Vuk who takes over the body of a human and befriends Jean, planning to use her powers to allow the aliens to take over the Earth. With an impassive expression throughout, Vuk never seems persuasive or dangerous.

Kinberg does comes through with a couple of spectacular action scenes. Jean seeks out Magneto on an island where he and other mutants have found peace. (Fingers crossed for a reality series, Survivor: Mutant Island.) When military helicopters arrive to take Jean away, Magneto puts up his hands and fends them off. It seems that Fassbender can do anything, because he actually lets us see and believe in Magneto’s physical and emotional struggle in that scene.

A bigger battle takes place in New York City, where Magneto, Charles and the other X-Men have tracked down Jean and Vuk. Magneto’s powers lift a subway train up out of the ground and send it hurtling into the front hall of a luxurious building across from Central Park. But two good action set pieces aren’t enough to keep things lively.

It’s hard to be engaged when the characters themselves seem so detached

The screen glows with fireballs of energy every 10 minutes or so, but the better special effects are imposed on Jean’s face. When her dark powers emerge, tiny lightning-like bolts appear on her face, as if it were being cracked by golden veins. Her eyes turn gold and glowing. It’s a creepy, effective image. At least Jean looks sinister, even if Turner gives her nothing behind that mask.

Dark Phoenix brings in the themes that most action-hero movies rely on. There’s the question of how to use superhuman powers, balanced by the humanising conceit of the heroic team as a family. Will the family hold or break apart? Earlier, better X-Men films, notably First Class (2011), allowed audiences to feel invested in these issues and the outcome. Here, it’s hard to be engaged when the characters themselves seem so detached.

Kinberg’s script has the occasional flash of wit and meta-awareness of the franchise’s history. When Magneto meets Charles again, his old friend and rival begins to explain why they should save Jean instead of killing her. Magneto says: “There’s always a speech.”

And Raven snaps at Charles, “By the way, the women are always saving the men around here. You might consider changing the name to X-Women.” The line is calculated to please audiences, but it’s hollow. Phoenix goes through the uninspired motions of saving the world, but she can’t even save her own film.

28,Why our ancestors drilled holes in each other's skulls,Robin Wylie,"For a large part of human prehistory, people around the world practised trepanation: a crude surgical procedure that involves forming a hole in the skull of a living person by either drilling, cutting or scraping away layers of bone with a sharp implement.

To date, thousands of skulls bearing signs of trepanation have been unearthed at archaeological sites across the world.

But despite its apparent importance, scientists are still not completely agreed on why our ancestors performed trepanation.

Anthropological accounts of 20th-Century trepanations in Africa and Polynesia suggest that, in these cases at least, trepanation was performed to treat pain – for instance, the pain caused by skull trauma or neurological disease.

Trepanation may also have had a similar purpose in prehistory. Many trepanned skulls show signs of cranial injuries or neurological diseases, often in the same region of the skull where the trepanation hole was made.

But as well as being used to treat medical conditions, researchers have long suspected that ancient humans performed trepanation for a quite different reason: ritual.

The earliest clear evidence of trepanation dates to approximately 7,000 years ago. It was practised in places as diverse as Ancient Greece, North and South America, Africa, Polynesia and the Far East. People probably developed the practice independently in several locations.

Archaeologists have turned up some of the best evidence for ritual trepanation ever discovered

Trepanation had been abandoned by most cultures by the end of the Middle Ages, but the practice was still being carried out in a few isolated parts of Africa and Polynesia until the early 1900s.

Since the very first scientific studies on trepanation were published in the 19th Century, scholars have continued to argue that ancient humans sometimes performed trepanation to allow the passage of spirits into or out of the body, or as part of an initiation rite.

However, convincing evidence is hard to come by. It is almost impossible to completely rule out the possibility that a trepanation was carried out for medical reasons, because some brain conditions leave no trace on the skull.

However, in a small corner of Russia archaeologists have turned up some of the best evidence for ritual trepanation ever discovered.

The story begins in 1997. Archaeologists were excavating a prehistoric burial site close to the city of Rostov-on-Don in the far south of Russia, near the northern reaches of the Black Sea.

The site contained the skeletal remains of 35 humans, distributed among 20 separate graves. Based on the style of the burials, the archaeologists knew that they dated to between approximately 5,000 and 3,000 BC, a period known as the Chalcolithic or ""Copper Age"".

Less than 1% of all recorded trepanations are located above the obelion point

One of the graves contained the skeletons of five adults – two women and three men – together with an infant aged between one and two years, and a girl in her mid-teens.

Finding multiple skeletons in the same prehistoric grave is not particularly unusual. But what had been done to their skulls was: the two women, two of the men and the teenage girl had all been trepanned.

Each of their skulls contained a single hole, several centimetres wide and roughly ellipsoidal in shape, with signs of scraping around the edges. The skull of the third man contained a depression which also showed evidence of having been carved, but not an actual hole. Only the infant's skull was unblemished.

The job of analysing the contents of the grave fell to Elena Batieva, an anthropologist now at the Southern Federal University in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. She immediately recognised the holes as trepanations, and she soon realised that these trepanations were unusual.

They had all been made in almost exactly the same location: a point on the skull called the ""obelion"". The obelion is on the top of the skull and towards the rear, roughly where a high ponytail might be gathered.

Opening the skull in this location would have risked major haemorrhage and death

Less than 1% of all recorded trepanations are located above the obelion point. What's more, Batieva knew that such trepanations were even less common in ancient Russia. As far as she was aware at the time, there was just one other recorded case of an obelion trepanation: a skull unearthed in 1974 at an archaeological site remarkably close to the one she was excavating.

Clearly, finding even one obelion trepanation is remarkable. But Batieva was looking at five, all of them buried in the same grave. This was, and is, unprecedented.

There is a good reason why obelion trepanation is uncommon: it is very dangerous.

The obelion point is located directly above the superior sagittal sinus, where blood from the brain collects before flowing into the brain's main outgoing veins. Opening the skull in this location would have risked major haemorrhage and death.

This suggests the Copper Age inhabitants of Russia must have had good reason to perform such trepanation procedures. Yet none of the skulls showed any signs of having suffered any injury or illness, before or after the trepanation had been performed.

Among the 137 skulls, they found nine with conspicuous holes

In other words, it appeared as if all of these people were trepanned while they were completely healthy. Was their trepanation evidence of some sort of ritual?

It was an intriguing possibility. However, Batieva had to give up the trail. She had many more skeletons to analyse from all over southern Russia, and could not afford to get sidetracked by just a few skulls, however enigmatic.

Before she gave up, Batieva decided to search through Russia's unpublished archaeological records, in case any more strange obelion trepanations had been discovered but not reported.

Surprisingly, she got two hits. The skulls of two young women with obelion trepanations had been discovered years earlier: one in 1980 and another in 1992. Each one had been unearthed less than 31 miles (50km) from Rostov-on-Don, and neither showed any signs of having been trepanned for a medical reason.

This gave Batieva a grand total of eight unusual skulls, all clustered in a small region of southern Russia and potentially all of about the same age. A decade later, even more came to light.

In 2011, an international team of archaeologists was analysing 137 human skeletons. They had recently been excavated from three separate Copper Age burial sites around 310 miles (500km) south-east of Rostov-on-Don, in the Stavropol Krai region of Russia, close to the modern-day border with Georgia.

The archaeologists had not set out to discover trepanations. They were there to learn about the general health of the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. But among the 137 skulls, they found nine with conspicuous holes.

Southern Russia may have been a centre for ritual trepanation

Five of them were standard examples of trepanation. The holes had been made in a variety of different locations around the front and side of the skull, and all of the skulls showed signs of having suffered a physical trauma, suggesting that the trepanations had been performed to treat the effects of the injuries.

But none of the other four trepanned skulls showed any signs of damage or disease. What's more, all four had been trepanned exactly above the obelion point.

Quite by chance one of the researchers – Julia Gresky, an anthropologist at the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) – had already read Batieva's paper describing the unusual trepanations from the Rostov-on-Don region.

Now Gresky, Batieva and other archaeologists have teamed up to describe all 12 of the obelion trepanations from Southern Russia. Their study was published in April 2016 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.

The 12 skulls would have been remarkable discoveries wherever they had been found. But the fact that they were all discovered in the same tiny corner of Russia meant that a connection seemed likely. If there was no link, the odds that a batch of such rare trepanations would turn up exclusively in southern Russia would have been exceedingly low.

Gresky, Bateiva and their colleagues argue that, while this idea is difficult to prove, the clustering of these unusual trepanations suggests that southern Russia may have been a centre for ritual trepanation.

The owners of the other skulls seem to have survived their operations

Maria Mednikova of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow is an expert on Russian trepanation. She believes that trepanations in specific, dangerous areas of the cranium may have been performed to achieve ""transformations"" of some kind. She suggests that, by trepanning in these places, people thought they could acquire unique skills that ordinary members of society did not have.

We can only speculate as to why these 12 apparently healthy people were trepanned in such an unusual and dangerous way. But thanks to the trepanation holes themselves, we can infer a surprising amount about the fate of the people after they received their trepanation.

One of the 12 skulls belonged to a woman under the age of 25, who had been buried at one of the sites near Rostov-on-Don. It showed no signs of healing, suggesting that she died during her trepanation or shortly afterwards.

However, the owners of the other skulls seem to have survived their operations. Their skulls showed bone healing around the edges of the trepanation holes – although the bone never completely re-grew over the holes.

Three of the 12 skulls showed only slight signs of healing around the trepanation hole, suggesting that their owners only survived between two and eight weeks after the operation. Two of these individuals were women between 20 and 35 years of age. The third was an elderly person between 50 and 70 years old, whose sex could not be determined.

The other eight skulls showed more advanced healing. Based on what we know about bone healing today, these individuals probably survived for at least four years after their operations.

It appeared as if all of these people were trepanned while they were completely healthy

These eight survivors included all five of the people from the mass grave near Rostov-on-Don, whose bizarrely-trepanned skulls first attracted Batieva's attention almost 20 years ago.

The two men, two women and one adolescent girl had all survived with their obelion holes for years. The girl, who based on her skeleton was between 14 and 16 years old, must have been trepanned when she was no older than 12, and possibly much younger.

It is still possible that these 12 people were suffering from diseases or head injuries. In that case, the trepanning operation may have worked for at least eight of them.

But it is also possible that Batieva and her colleagues are right, and these people were trepanned for a ritual purpose. If that is true, we can only guess at what benefits they received – or believed they had received – throughout the rest of their lives.

29,The painstaking story behind the euro symbol,Hepzibah Anderson,"The value of those euro coins left as a tip at the bistro, taverna or tapas bar has fluctuated in the 17 years since they went into circulation, as with all currencies. Where the euro differs is that its ultimate worth has always been more than just monetary. Indeed, it’s hard to think of another currency that comes minted with such lofty ambition and political idealism, and with the Brexit drama skittering onwards and internal tensions tugging, this remains truer than ever.

As one of the world’s newest currencies, the euro’s decades-long gestation and protracted birth have been meticulously documented. It’s a story of meetings, negotiations, treaties and yet more meetings, its cast comprised almost exclusively of politicians and civil servants. The kind of yarn, in other words, likely to set only the pulse of an economic historian racing. Altogether more mysterious – and contested – is how the euro acquired the sign by which it’s known around the world.

The new currency’s name was chosen in Madrid in 1995. Allegedly the suggestion of a Belgian teacher and Esperanto buff, “euro” triumphed over a string of other contenders, including the irresistibly Shakespearean “ducat”. A crucial consideration was that the name must be the same in all of Europe’s official languages, and uniformity was deemed vital for the sign that would represent it too.

Unlike older currency signs that have evolved organically over centuries, the euro sign was designed by committee. The brief comprised three key elements: it must be a highly recognisable symbol of Europe, it had to echo well-known existing currency symbols, and it needed to be aesthetically pleasing and simple to write by hand. It fell to European Commission staff to compile a list of more than 30 possible designs. These were then whittled down to 10 and submitted to the public. Two designs emerged ahead of the rest, and it was left to then President of the European Commission Jacques Santer and Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the commissioner in charge of economic and financial affairs, to choose between them.

Precise and confident, like a post-modern pretzel

When the selected symbol was unveiled in December 1996, it was applauded by the now defunct newspaper The European as being “precise and confident, like a post-modern pretzel”. Elsewhere, it caused confusion. A ‘C’ bisected by two horizontal bars? Well, no, it was actually inspired by the Greek letter epsilon. A reference to the cradle of European civilisation, it emphasised historical continuity – as the design of the banknotes themselves would do – while also evoking an ‘E’ for Europe. The classical connection came to seem decidedly ironic when, in 2010, Greece’s bailout crisis threatened the stability of the entire eurozone. Just as well those two parallel lines running through its centre signify stability.

Curiously, it’s now all but impossible to trace the symbol that was runner-up in the popularity contest. It must exist in a Brussels vault, but search online and it’s as if the euro symbol was ever-destined to take its current form. There’s a fog of vagueness surrounding the public consultation, too. How many EU citizens were consulted? And of which nationalities? As to the identities of the designers behind the winning image – an image that became globally recognisable overnight – there were allegedly four of them.

What is specified is the sign’s geometric construction. Proportions must be exact, with foreground and background colour tones also stipulated. When officials decided to patent it, the euro became the world’s first copyrighted currency sign. None of this pleased typographic experts, who were suddenly faced with incorporating a new typographical symbol, or glyph, into existing fonts. Computer applications struggled, too, resulting in conversion errors that frequently saw a question mark pop up in place of the required symbol.

The euro was introduced as a non-cash currency, for instance in electronic transfers, at midnight on 1 January 1999. In 2001, with 14.25 billion banknotes and 50 billion coins set to flood 11 member states the following year, two bizarre challenges emerged to the official EU narrative. The sign had already been criticised for its resemblance to the old logo of US electronics company Commodore, but British foreign exchange specialist Travelex went a step further. Claiming that it had been using a strikingly similar sign in correspondence between a subsidiary and its business partners since 1989, it sued the European Commission for trademark infringement. (The court eventually ruled in favour of the EC, leaving Travelex facing a hefty euro bill.)

Regardless of who really designed it, this symbol of Europe is in many ways exactly what the sign has become

Then, just a few months later, one Arthur Eisenmenger spoke out from his retirement home in southern Germany, claiming that it was he who’d created the symbol more than 25 years earlier, while working as chief graphic designer for what was then the European Economic Community. Eisenmenger is credited with supervising the creation of the star-ringed EU flag and the “CE” quality control mark for European consumer goods. He created the euro sign, he claimed, as an emblem for Europe in general. “I wasn’t thinking of the euro at the time, but just something that symbolised Europe,” he told The Guardian.

Regardless of who really designed it, this symbol of Europe is in many ways exactly what the sign has become. Along with the Union’s flag and Ode to Joy-based anthem, it’s transcended its practical purpose and emerged as an icon of the European project. Perhaps the ultimate proof of its success is this: with the versatility of a truly enduring symbol, it can now even be spotted on pro-Brexit placards.
