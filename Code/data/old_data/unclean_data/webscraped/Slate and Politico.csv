The latest bombshell from the formerly secret files of the GOP’s top gerrymandering guru emerged on Thursday, and it’s astounding: Voting rights advocates claim to have evidence that North Carolina Republican lawmakers repeatedly lied to a federal court, and to the public, in a successful effort to delay a special election that threatened their legislative supermajority.

Republicans across the country employed Thomas Hofeller for years to draw gerrymanders that would dilute Democratic votes. When he died in 2018, he left behind 18 thumb drives and four hard drives containing 75,000 files—a vast trove of information detailing his work for the GOP, including damning revelations. His estranged daughter turned over the material to Common Cause, a voting rights advocacy group, in February.

The newest discovery from the files pertains to Covington v. North Carolina, a challenge to Republicans’ racial gerrymander of state legislative districts. In 2016, a federal district court ordered the legislature to draw new maps and hold a special election after finding the map had been illegally gerrymandered along racial lines.

The Supreme Court agreed that the maps were unlawful, but sent the case back to district court to resolve how quickly Republican lawmakers could draw new maps without excessively disrupting the state’s elections. GOP legislators insisted that they had not yet prepared any maps and would need ample time to do so. So the district court declined to order the special election, allowing Republicans to maintain their supermajority for another year and further manipulate state elections. (The supermajority was broken in 2018, the next election under the new maps.)

According to Common Cause, these representations to the district court were a lie. Republican legislative leaders told the court that they had not “start[ed] the laborious process of redistricting earlier” than July 2017, and that they could only “begin the process of compiling a record in July 2017 with a goal of enacting new plans by the end of the year.” These lawmakers claimed they needed more time to “engage in internal discussions about the design of remedial districts” and “prepare draft remedial plans.” This effectively convinced the court to scrap the special election.

Further, at a legislative hearing, a Democratic lawmakers explicitly asked Rep. David Lewis, who led the redistricting effort, whether there was “anything that has been drawn by Dr. Hofeller or anybody else that you know of that have not yet been released.” Lewis responded: “Not that I know of, sir.” He also stated: “I have not yet drawn maps nor have I directed that maps be drawn, nor am I aware of any other entity operating in conjunction with the leadership that has drawn maps.”

GOP attorneys are fighting tooth and nail to keep the remaining Hofeller files out of court and the public eye.

The Hofeller files tell a different story. According to a new legal filing, these materials reveal Hofeller had completed more than 97 percent of the new Senate plan and 90 percent of the new House plan by June 2017. In other words, Republicans allegedly lied to the federal district court. In July 2017, GOP lawmakers claimed that they had prepared no maps and therefore could not draw new districts in time for a special election—when, in reality, those maps were nearly finished.

Finally, and perhaps most damningly, Common Cause accused Republicans of lying about their use of racial data in redistricting. Because it was fixing a racial gerrymander, the district court ordered that data “identifying the race of individuals or voters shall not be used in the drawing of legislative districts in the 2017 House and Senate plans.” Republicans told the court that “data regarding the race of voters was not used in the drawing of the districts, and, in fact, was not even loaded into the computer used by the map drawer to construct the districts.” They added that “we have not had and do not have racial data on any of these districts” and “there was no racial data reviewed in the preparation of this map.”

The Hofeller files reveal, Common Cause wrote, “that none of the above statements were true.” In fact, his computer seems to have had data “regarding the racial composition of the proposed districts for each and every iteration of his draft maps.” Hofeller even displayed the black voting age population in some draft maps, and “had racial data on the draft districts in Excel spreadsheets.” As Republicans swore to a court that they would not incorporate racial data—not even look at such data—their mapmaker was, the evidence shows, doing exactly that.

Common Cause disclosed this information on Thursday to combat Republican attempts to seize the Hofeller files. GOP attorneys have tried to force the group to return all of Hofeller’s materials—which it obtained lawfully—by claiming work-product privilege over the documents. Common Cause argues that it may keep this proof of “false statements” because it is “highly relevant” to its ongoing fight against the legislative gerrymander.

Meanwhile, Republicans have argued that Hofeller drew these secret maps “out of personal interest in his spare time.” They also argue that Hofeller’s daughter, Stephanie Hofeller Lizon, took advantage of her mother, Kathy, in order to obtain the files. (Kathy readily agreed to let her daughter keep the materials, but Republicans assert that she may be incompetent, though no court has found that she is.) GOP attorneys are fighting tooth and nail to keep the remaining Hofeller files out of court and the public eye.

But they are failing, because Common Cause seems to have every right to keep and use the vast majority of the files. For years, Republicans worked in secret to erode North Carolina’s democracy with Hofeller’s help. Now that his work is in the hands of his opponents, the GOP is beginning to face consequences for its actions. And Thursday’s revelation—which could result in court sanctions for Republican lawmakers who allegedly lied to the court—will not be the last smoking gun from the Hofeller files.



Common Cause is currently asking a state court to invalidate the maps that Republicans drew in 2017, when GOP legislators allegedly lied about their use of racial data. The group is seeking new, fairer districts for the 2020 election. With the Hofeller files in hand, its case is getting stronger by the day.","The newest discovery from the files pertains to Covington v.

1,Can Elizabeth Warren actually win in 2020? She’s giving women reason to hope.,Dahlia Lithwick,"The photos were all over the internet on election night of 2016. They went viral in the bad way, and they all looked something like this: Women, standing in a crowd of other women, hands over their mouths, tears on their cheeks, as they realized that Hillary Clinton had lost to Donald Trump, the man who bragged about treating women like garbage. Those photos had come immediately on the heels of the other photos, also inescapable, taken earlier that day: Women posed outside of public schools, and churches, and rec centers, wearing pantsuits and beaming into the camera with elated looks that said, I just voted for the first woman to be president of the United States! That whiplash? That immense distance between the two sets of photos, between the historic, thrilling high of the morning and the gut punch of the night that followed? It’s a feeling millions of women have been processing ever since.

In all the soul searching that came in the months after November 2016, it didn’t take long for that feeling to turn into a question: Would it be insane to run a woman—any woman—against Donald Trump in 2020? As my friend Michelle Goldberg put it six months after Trump had won, “many American women want to break the male lock on the presidency, but they also want to save the republic, and it’s all too possible that those two goals are at odds.” We had all just witnessed a highly qualified woman lose the presidency to a carnival barker. Why, with the stakes growing ever higher, would we even consider trying it again?

Which brings me to Elizabeth Warren and the women who love her.

Warren seems to be surging in the polls this month. It is certainly true that a lot of men are proving to be stalwart fans and a lot of women are lining up behind other candidates, for once having the option to pick between other women running for president, including Kamala Harris, who is neck and neck with Warren in several polls. But a few months ago I started to notice a boomlet of sorts, women who were willing to fall in love with Warren, just as they had with Clinton, and women who feel that Warren alone can redeem the insult Clinton sustained. To be clear, Elizabeth Warren is not Hillary Clinton. Comparing them distorts and diminishes their unique accomplishments and formidable skills. And yet: Even taking into account the late-breaking Comey effect and the years of Clinton family baggage, it has always been utterly obvious that part of Clinton’s loss was due to misogyny—a misogyny that, if anything, has only become more apparent in the years since.

America, it seems, suffers an enduring baked-in disdain for women that we somehow continue to feign surprise at, even through the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, and the unhealthy fixation on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the state abortion crackdowns. Which is why I’ve been struck by the number of women I encounter who are attempting to reframe the swirling questions of “electability” and let go of the trauma of 2016 so they can fall hard for another qualified, competent female candidate. Do they really believe that the woman Trump has already nicknamed, insulted, and lured into an unforced error could win this thing?

I wanted to see for myself, to understand the allure of Warren, and to figure out how women are thinking about her. Plus, it would make this whole infuriating question of whether a woman is ever going to be “electable” much simpler, I thought, if she happened to be a natural at this campaigning thing. She isn’t, as it turns out, a natural at the kind of straw-boater-and-bunting idea of campaigning we’ve internalized over a century of watching white male candidates eat steaks in Iowa. She is something rather different.

At a mid-May campaign event in Fairfax, Virginia, I watched as Warren jogged out onto the stage and wheezed through the first few moments of her remarks. She has a big, forced window-washer wave, and as she launched into her prepared autobiography she referred to her father, over and over again, as “Daddy.” (I am not quite sure how we are supposed to be throwing off the patriarchy if we are still referring to our fathers as “daddies” into our late 60s.) But here is the part that is striking: Warren absolutely came alive when she started taking questions from her audience. Explaining incredibly complex policy problems in a perfectly coherent way turns out to be Warren’s superpower. And while I went in dubious that Warren’s policy-minded campaign could ever compete with the charisma-driven, Father-Knows-Best performances of presidential candidates from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton, let alone the supercharged persona of Donald Trump, I realized that I was completely confused about the nature of political charisma itself.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren Maddie McGarvey/Slate

Two articles of faith must be addressed here: One is that watching and scoring and fighting about the Democratic primary this early in the season is silly and quite possibly futile, particularly considering the almost-hilarious number of candidates (perhaps not such a bad thing when you recognize how much this field has broken out of the white male monopoly). The other is that Warren has had a very good couple of weeks. Her polling numbers show her narrowing the gap behind Joe Biden and—perhaps more importantly—catching up with Bernie Sanders. Warren has been generating a constant stream of news, thanks to her capacity for releasing a detailed new policy initiative nearly every week and her willingness to, for instance, call Fox News “a hate-for-profit racket.” She took a strikingly strong stand on Trump and impeachment, linking him to the same systemwide corruption with which she had cudgeled Fox. And as one state after another passed abortion bans that were retrograde and cruel, Warren rolled out comprehensive abortion reforms that would bolster reproductive rights nationwide, even if Roe v. Wade were overturned by the Supreme Court.

Warren is, in brief, almost painfully serious precisely because she is banking on public seriousness, running on the notion that bread and circus have had their day, and it is time now to save the republic. Warren is hoping voters are willing to engage with a persona that is competent and sober, qualities they persistently say they value when speaking to pollsters but tend to reject in favor of charisma at the ballot box. But she is proof that competent and sober does not have to mean cold and impersonal on the trail.

At the Fairfax campaign stop, Warren tells some thousand people who have shown up to hear her, a crowd visibly dominated by women, that her lifelong dream was to be a teacher—a dream she lived up to as a special education teacher and a law professor before becoming a United States senator and, now, a candidate for president. This is something some of the Warren think pieces tend to miss: Warren is an extraordinary educator. We misread her as a detached wonk when she’s actually a brilliant translator of complex ideas. Watching her on the stump, you come to realize that it’s not so much the fact that she knows a lot of technical and complicated things that truly excites her fans, it’s that she can explain them to you.

Warren shines in her unscripted Q&As precisely because she isn’t trying to please the Unknowable American Electorate of 2020. She is just trying to answer whatever the questioner is asking in the moment. She knows how to subordinate her own narrative to that of the interlocutor, but she also knows how to use her narrative to empathize with a questioner’s individual concerns. Warren knows what it’s like to be poor. She knows what it’s like to be a paycheck away from insolvency. She knows what it’s like to have family members serve in the military. She knows what it’s like to love someone addicted to opioids. She understands how it feels to almost lose your house to foreclosure. This isn’t “I alone can fix it” stuff. It’s “let me help you fix it.” In the most tender exchange at the Fairfax rally, she tells a young man that she also knows how it feels to lose faith in government. And then she goes on to explain how we got here and what she’d do to get us out.

People think Warren is a wonk because it’s apparent that she spends plenty of time elbow-deep in policy. But really, she’s the polar opposite of a wonk. She’s not a political ambassador of policy for policy’s sake. She’s a politician who is hoping to bridge the gap between policy arcana and citizens who keep falling behind. And every time she releases a new policy, millions of people learn something new about how government works.

Talking to people who attended Warren rallies in Fairfax and Cincinnati, one theme that kept coming up is how nobody should have been fooled by Donald Trump. In the eyes of these voters, it’s all perfectly clear: He isn’t rich, he isn’t smart, he doesn’t care, and he doesn’t even like us much. For so many of the women I talked to, one of the main reasons Trump is frightening is because he can’t seem to see or imagine anything beyond his own limited experience. Time and again, they told me that they don’t need charm (even as they insist that Warren is likable). What they need is information, and an ally, and a plan. A recent college graduate at the Fairfax rally told me she couldn’t imagine a life untethered from debt. But she had just been online checking Warren’s calculator to determine what sort of loan relief she’d be eligible for under the candidate’s plan.

Do I worry that Elizabeth Warren isn’t fantastic on the stump? I do. But Warren doesn’t seem to care much about being loved. She cares a lot about explaining where things fell apart. So her campaign goes to tiny blue-collar towns in tiny red states she cannot hope to win, and she talks about opioid addiction with Trump supporters who have never met a presidential hopeful and may never meet one again. The labor here is about connecting the dots more than lighting crowds on fire.

Watching this play out on the trail, I couldn’t help but think of an idea Rebecca Solnit recently explored in a piece about our possible newfound resistance to “great men” theories of governance. Solnit suggests that we may be finally tiring of:

the hero as an attention-getter, a party-crasher, a fame-seeker, and at least implicitly a troublemaker in the guise of a problem-solver. And maybe we as a society are getting tired of heroes, and a lot of us are certainly getting tired of overconfident white men. Even the idea that the solution will be singular and dramatic and in the hands of one person erases that the solutions to problems are often complex and many faceted and arrived at via negotiations.

What Solnit is holding out as the new ideal of leadership is not, by any stretch, exclusively female. But it is an idea less tethered to goose bump–y speeches, or the kind of charisma that leaves an audience thrilled yet unable to recall any idea actually expressed. We’ve now elected two “charismatics” in a row to the presidency, and the model Warren is building, while not lacking in surface polish, surely doesn’t coast on it. Her campaign is less TED talk than graduate seminar. And her “students” become evangelists of her big ideas more than evangelists of her.

I don’t know whether Elizabeth Warren can win the Democratic primary. I’m not yet certain a woman can win at all. A country that is OK prosecuting women who miscarry isn’t really a country I recognize, much less one I can believe in. Worse, I shudder at the implication that Warren, the woman, will do all the grueling legwork of educating voters about corruption, and banking, and unions, and debt, so that some man in a glittering cape might swoop in and charm our socks off next summer.

Women are often told they react emotionally to candidates, while men are meant to admire and appreciate complex policy. Warren is disrupting that paradigm.

Women are often told they react emotionally to candidates, while men are meant to admire and appreciate complex policy. Warren is disrupting that paradigm. She leans less on charisma or charm, or even emotion, than on that elaborate PowerPoint she keeps stowed in her head. It’s a different approach from the men out in front of her. A warm and effusive Joe Biden has been coronated the favorite without having to break a sweat. Bernie Sanders has long had some of the most loyal supporters around, in part because he is so unabashedly “himself.”

But the women who come to these early Warren rallies like being addressed by an adult as adults. At a time when America has devalued teachers, empathy, expertise, and planning for the future, Elizabeth Warren serves as one reminder of what we have lost. It doesn’t mean the voters will necessarily throng to her side. It just means that the women I spoke to, and more and more of the women I know, don’t mind being educated about how everything went so terribly wrong in their political lifetimes. Elizabeth Warren can explain it, and has a plan for it, and believes she can fix it. It’s not glittery, and it may not make your heart beat faster in a stadium. But in a world of noise and bluster, her clarity has its own sort of charm.","Do they really believe that the woman Trump has already nicknamed, insulted, and lured into an unforced error could win this thing?

2,Billion Dollar Bully Highlights Why Yelp Feels Unfair,Stephen Harrison,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Virgyl Sowah on Unsplash.

Welcome to Source Notes, a Future Tense column about the internet’s knowledge ecosystem.

The overall argument of Billion Dollar Bully, the new documentary about Yelp released on Amazon and iTunes in May, is that Yelp extorts small business owners for advertising fees in return for helping to manage and improve reviews on their platform. Earnest and fiery throughout, the film allows the aggrieved parties ample time to vent. The film opens, for example, with Davide Cerretini, owner of a San Francisco Italian restaurant, who claims that Yelp’s salespeople called him 20 times a week pressuring him to advertise on the platform. He finally acquiesced and agreed to a six-month contract, which he did not renew. Once he stopped paying for advertising, Cerretini claims his positive reviews vanished, only to be replaced with new and mysterious negative reviews. “To me, it’s mafia,” Cerretini says in the film.

In another example, Danny Teran describes how his Brooklyn restaurant was falsely accused of inflating its Yelp reviews and had their page marked with a “consumer alert” pop-up, a digital scarlet letter that turned off potential customers. When he tried to call Yelp, there was no ability to speak to a human representative from the company about the issue—unless he was interested in buying Yelp ads. “There is nothing you can do!” says an exasperated Teran.

Yelp has fought back against the allegations made in the film, arguing that “There has never been a connection between ratings and reviews on Yelp and buying advertising.” After the film’s release, Jason Brown at ReviewFraud.org suggested that at least some examples of extortion presented in the film were dubious. But the issue for small business owners has always been broader than advertising: Local businesses feel that Yelp offers no due process to resolve disputes and misunderstandings. That’s because the company’s standard position is to absolve itself of any responsibility to get involved.

The documentary includes a clip from a 2013 interview on The Charlie Rose Show in which Yelp’s co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman claims his company is “just like Wikipedia—it’s open to all comers.” Presumably Stoppelman means that both sites use a crowdsourcing model to aggregate information. But even a cursory review shows that Yelp and Wikipedia are not all that similar. Yelp is a publicly traded company that earns revenue from online advertising, whose name stems from an amalgamation of “yellow pages” and “help.” On the other hand, Wikipedia is a project of the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation that relies on user donations (which is why from time to time the site displays those pesky black-and-yellow banners asking you to support the site for the price of a cup of coffee).

Yelp and Wikipedia also differ dramatically in their approach to facts. In Yelp’s case, the company prefers not to get involved at all. A spokesperson for Yelp told me in an email that “We don’t take sides in factual disputes, so in these cases, we recommend that businesses use Yelp’s free response tools to respond and address that review, stating the facts and their company policy.” Unless the review is found to violate Yelp’s terms of service or content guidelines, it’s likely to remain on the site. If someone leaves an inaccurate review, Yelp recommends that the owner use Yelp’s “free response tools” to address that review. Needless to say, this isn’t very comforting to local businesses. The film features Dawn King, a registered nurse, who claimed a former employee left a fake review on the Yelp page for the medical office of Dr. David H.C. King, a urologist, as retaliation for being terminated. In the review, the ex-employee claimed that King had botched her surgery (an event that never happened). Yelp’s standard position that the business should work it out with the reviewer is unlikely to be successful in cases such as this, where one party is clearly acting in bad faith. (Note: It appears Yelp has now removed the fake review of Dr. King for violating the site’s terms of service.)

While Yelp generally absolves itself of factual disputes, Wikipedia sits at the other extreme: The community of Wikipedia editors famously debates the facts 24/7/365. (The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation supports the community volunteers and provides the technology for hosting Wikipedia and Wikimedia sites but does not directly involve itself in editorial policy, which is self-policed by the community of volunteer editors.) And there is general willingness within the Wikipedia community to delete obvious falsehoods and vandalism. When actress Doris Day’s page was defaced with a graphic image shortly after her death in May, the issue was resolved within a few minutes. Wikipedia’s processes and policies do not always work perfectly, of course, but the site is committed to building a neutral and informative encyclopedia, and that means bad information simply must come down.

When I contacted Yelp about the claims made in the documentary, a spokesperson told me that the company used several tools to detect illegitimate reviews: automated recommendation software, human moderators who work full-time on the Yelp support team, and functionality for users to flag suspicious content. The company is especially proud of its automated software. A spokesperson said in an email, “Our recommendation software has always been engineered to surface the most useful and reliable reviews, and has been improved over time to be even more effective at sifting fake and biased reviews, and attempts by businesses to game the system.”

What do we expect from internet knowledge platforms when it comes to informational accuracy?

But notice how Yelp does not promise that a small business owner can speak to a Yelp representative or appeal to any sort of third-party arbitrator about taking down a fake review. This is likely cost-driven. Adding a formal process to consider contentious reviews would be highly expensive for the company, which has been publicly traded since 2012. The documentary also highlights how Yelp is virtually invulnerable to lawsuits. The company’s terms require that all claims be brought in the state and federal courts of San Francisco, which is challenging for out-of-state and international plaintiffs. Furthermore, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally protects internet companies from being sued for content they host for which they haven’t assumed responsibility. In sum, a local business that has been damaged from a false review has little recourse from Yelp itself, nor via the traditional legal system, and no ability to opt out of the platform. It’s little wonder the small business owners interviewed in Bully appear so dejected.

Yelp is combating the claims made in the film by purchasing the domain BillionDollarBully.com and redirecting it to a Yelp page that explains that the company does not extort local businesses to manipulate ratings. A company spokesperson told me that the extortion conspiracy theory has been disproven by independent scholarly studies, including one by Harvard Business School. (The film notes the limitations of the HBS study, which focused specifically on the Boston metropolitan area.) Yelp has also launched a Google Ad campaign to “educate people” about the allegations made in the documentary.

Speaking of Google … I reached out to Bully’s director, Kaylie Milliken, to ask a question that wasn’t specifically addressed in the film: If people shouldn’t use Yelp, what site should they use instead? I have written before about a “duty to Yelp” by writing online reviews for small businesses, but even in that piece, I clarified that I wasn’t wedded to Yelp as the platform. Did Milliken have a better recommendation, perhaps Google Reviews or TripAdvisor? Milliken demurred. “It’s hard to be a legitimate review site when you have a fiduciary duty to investors,” she said, noting the tension companies face between generating advertising revenue and keeping costs low. Milliken also challenged me to consider why we need online reviews at all. “I think it’s important to get off the computer and just experience things for yourself or ask for recommendations from trusted members of your community,” Milliken said. While I admire the humanism of this approach, it seems a bit idealistic. Many of us do get much of our information online, usually for expediency, but also because it’s not always practicable or comfortable to ask a close friend—for example, while traveling to a new city or researching a new doctor.

Instead of unplugging from all review sites, we might reconsider what we expect from internet knowledge platforms when it comes to informational accuracy. Taking further responsibility contradicts Yelp’s standard position, as expressed to me by their spokesperson and voiced repeatedly in the documentary: We do not get involved in factual disputes. But washing their hands of responsibility for misinformation may not be a viable long-term solution for Yelp or similar websites. A combination of factors might ultimately spur a change: revisions to Section 230 of the CDA, government regulation of online speech, further public outcry, or a renewed sense of corporate and digital citizenship. Until then, allegations that Yelp’s system is unfair will continue.

Most Republicans in Congress believe President Donald Trump’s plan to impose escalating tariffs on Mexico until the country does, well, something or other about the U.S. border is a terrible idea. Their hope, still, is that Mexico offers the Trump administration some face-saving commitment to do more to stem the flow of migrants and that the administration accepts, soon, before tariffs go into effect on … let’s see here … Monday! Barring that, Republicans will have to decide whether to take legislative action to reject a policy they find abhorrent to their free-market beliefs and disruptive to the daily commercial flow of billions of dollars, or to just let Trump do his thing.

There’s a real possibility that Senate Republicans would provide a veto-proof majority to block the tariffs if it comes to that. Fortunately for Trump, House Republicans will likely remain as House Republican-y as ever, doing whatever he tells them to do and forcing a smile while they do it.

Senate Republicans, just about to a person, are apoplectic over the tariff proposal, which would start at 5 percent on all goods and increase each month until Mexico solves America’s immigration issues. The White House, in an effort that senators definitely interpreted as a slight, sent a couple of hapless lawyers to Senate Republicans’ Tuesday luncheon to field their questions about the policy. (The actual meaningful people in the administration were busy traipsing around England in silly little jackets.)

House Republicans will likely remain as House Republican-y as ever, doing whatever Trump tells them to do and forcing a smile while they do it.

The lawyers were given a proper scorching. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said that the administration “is trying to use tariffs to solve every problem but HIV and climate change.” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told them that they would have trouble voting to sustain the president’s veto of a measure blocking the tariff. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose state would be particularly hard hit by the broad tariff on its neighbor, told the lawyers that he wanted them to take a message back to the White House: that they “didn’t hear a single yes” from the conference in support of the tariff.

In the president’s formal announcement of the plan on May 30, he said he would invoke emergency authorities available to him under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the duty. If the president were to impose the tariffs through emergency powers, Congress could then use its own statutory powers, through the National Emergencies Act, to try to block the move. That’s what Congress tried earlier this year when the president declared a national emergency to unlock border wall construction funds. While the resolution of disapproval passed both chambers, it didn’t pass by enough in the House to override the president’s veto. And that’s likely what would happen this time, too, if House Democrats introduced a disapproval resolution, which they’re preparing to do.

The president on Wednesday morning tweeted a supposed quote from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that sounded an awful lot like a quote that Trump would fantasize one of his chief sycophants saying.

“House Republicans support the President on Tariffs with Mexico all the way, & that makes any measure the President takes on the Border totally Veto proof. Why wouldn’t you as Republicans support him when that will allow our President to make a better deal.” Thank you @GOPLeader — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2019

No one knows when or if McCarthy actually ever said this. But it’s close enough to where McCarthy stands on the issue, which is to have the president’s back. McCarthy is almost certainly praying that these tariffs never go into effect and that a deal is reached to avert them. But he’s not going to go against the president with his votes, on this or anything, because that’s not how Kevin McCarthy or the House Republican conference rolls.

Assuming all Democrats voted for the disapproval resolution, they would need about 55 Republicans to join them for a veto-proof majority. Only 14 Republicans joined Democrats in the border emergency veto-override vote in March. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the far-right Freedom Caucus, predicted a measure to block the tariff would similarly come “nowhere near the 55 threshold.”

Consider the following quote from Texas Rep. Kenny Marchant, who, like much of the Texas delegation, is not psyched about slapping a tax on all goods from neighboring Mexico. But, alas, he has a “longtime policy” of not checking assertions of executive power with which he disagrees.

“I’m not going to vote on a disapproval of the president’s actions. That’s a longtime policy of mine,” Marchant told the Washington Post. “I never voted against the governor when I was in the statehouse.” He added that in order to break that sacred vow of allowing executives to do whatever they wanted, “It would have to be very egregious.”

I don’t look forward to the day that Trump has done something House Republicans deem egregious enough to stop.","There’s a real possibility that Senate Republicans would provide a veto-proof majority to block the tariffs if it comes to that.
Fortunately for Trump, House Republicans will likely remain as House Republican-y as ever, doing whatever he tells them to do and forcing a smile while they do it.

5,The Warriors’ Silicon Valley Strategy Now Involves Venture Capitalists Shoving Opposing Point Guards,Nick Greene,"Kyle Lowry argues with Warriors minority investor Mark Stevens at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, on Wednesday. Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images

You can’t jump a few feet in the Bay Area without falling on or near a venture capitalist. That’s what happened during Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, when Kyle Lowry chased a loose ball into the crowd during the fourth quarter and landed next to Mark Stevens, a prominent Silicon Valley investor who used to be a partner at Sand Hill Road staple Sequoia Capital. When Lowry attempted to return to the court, Stevens shoved him on the shoulder and, according to the point guard, told him to “go fuck yourself.”

Kyle Lowry was shaking his head after a courtside fan pushed him when he fell into the crowd. pic.twitter.com/5SwQv3hdnN — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) June 6, 2019

“Fans like that shouldn’t be allowed to be in there.” Lowry said after the game, adding that he hoped the league will “ban him from all NBA games forever.” Stevens may look like your average polo-and-lanyard-wearing Warriors fan, but his station in life adds a layer of complexity to the incident. As Axios reported on Thursday, Stevens is one of Golden State’s minority owners.

Stevens’ seat was left vacant for the remainder of the game, and on Thursday, the Warriors released a statement and apology. The NBA later announced he had been banned for a year and fined $500,000:

Mr. Stevens’ behavior last night did not reflect the high standards that we hope to exemplify as an organization. We’re extremely disappointed in his actions and, along with Mr. Stevens, offer our sincere apology to Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors organization for this unfortunate misconduct. There is no place for such interaction between fans—or anyone—and players at an NBA game.

Were he a normal fan, Stevens could have argued that he got caught up in the moment. Lowry came crashing down pretty hard, and the ensuing adrenaline rush must have been pretty killer—at least more potent than what one experiences during a long day of Venture Capitaling. But that argument wouldn’t have worked, as fans who sit courtside know to expect the occasional flying point guard. After all, that’s what they paid for.

Stevens, meanwhile, paid for a slice of the team itself. In 2010, billionaire venture capitalist Joe Lacob led a 19-person investment group that bought the Warriors for $450 million. Stevens purchased a stake in 2013 and saw his investment turn into a championship-winning dynasty shortly thereafter. As a result, Lacob and his cohort have been credited frequently for turning the franchise around with their “Silicon Valley–style” techniques. The culmination of this transformation is next season’s move to the Chase Center, the team’s new home across the bay in San Francisco. That stadium will offer premium courtside suites that, according to the Washington Post, will be “equipped with a butler, a well-appointed dining room area for social events and a private wine cellar.” Future VCs will wonder why Stevens bothered to shove Kyle Lowry himself—couldn’t he have asked his butler to do it for him?

“Lacob was not the first venture capitalist to buy a franchise,” the New York Times explained in 2016, “but he is the first to operate one according to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management, open communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous re-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it.” Those precepts don’t seem to include “shoving opposing point guards,” though in light of Wednesday’s game, it may be worth re-examining the intended meaning of “nimble management.”

Stevens is quoted in that Times feature, and he knocks owners who try to muddle too much, the types who want to control everything “down to the color of the underwear.” He was correct back then. Management really should be hands-off.","Kyle Lowry argues with Warriors minority investor Mark Stevens at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, on Wednesday.

6,What’s it like to be swarmed by ladybugs?,Shannon Palus,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images Plus.

On an otherwise clear night earlier this week, a large green blob showed up on the radar of the National Weather Service’s San Diego office. “It looked like echoes reflecting off raindrops, but we weren’t seeing any clouds,” meteorologist Mark Moede who was observing the blob later told the Washington Post.

What else is raindrop size, but doesn’t come from clouds? Ladybugs. A volunteer on the ground reported that there were “ladybugs everywhere.” The image was “actually a cloud of ladybugs termed a ‘bloom,’ ” tweeted the National Weather Service office in San Diego. (The weather service has settled on this explanation for now, though Moede later clarified to the Post that it’s possible it was something else, like a military effort to foil radar with aluminum particles) . The “bloom” may have shown up on the radar because the ladybugs were flying at thousands of feet, part of an annual migration from mountains to valleys, a local ABC affiliate explained.

All this made us wonder: What is it like to be in the middle of a ton of ladybugs?

Slate’s own culture editor Forrest Wickman has had such an experience. “The ladybugs seemed cute at first,” he told me, recalling the fateful day one summer when he was a teen. He remembers standing on his family’s porch in Connecticut wearing a brightly colored shirt as more and more ladybugs approached him. “There is a number at which they start to shade from cute into kinda creepy, and there is a larger number at which they shade from kinda creepy to terrifying. By the time it appeared that I was no longer wearing a bright-colored shirt but was instead wearing a red shirt, made of ladybugs, I was running toward the sliding door,” he said. So many ladybugs ended up inside his house that summer that he remembers becoming accustomed to the sound of them crunching beneath his feet.

If you want to feel a fraction of what Wickman felt that day, I suggest watching videos of swarms on YouTube. There’s this one of hundreds of ladybugs clustering on a tree in Northern California, according to the video’s poster, or this one of ladybugs looking like clusters of seeds or berries, or this one of ladybugs crawling on a woman’s arm and home in an undisclosed location (the residents were worried about curious tourists also swarming their home), or this one from PBS that features swaths of bugs that the narrator describes “almost like some sort of disease, except its moving.”

If videos are not enough to satiate your ladybug curiosity, you can travel to one of the spots where ladybugs are known to cluster, like the Muir Woods National Park in late November. (Ladybugs are not dangerous, but they can secrete a foul-smelling liquid, which means you might not want to get super close.) You could even purchase hundreds of live ladybugs on Amazon and release them into your own swarm. Slate editor Dan Kois did this for his child’s birthday: “It was a ladybug-themed party and at the end we gave everyone little cups with airholes and then opened the bag and a bazillion ladybugs flew everywhere and kids screamed, mostly happily.” Mostly!","On an otherwise clear night earlier this week, a large green blob showed up on the radar of the National Weather Service’s San Diego office.

7,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge addresses James Bond script, female characters.",Natalia Winkelman,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge on May 12 in London. Jeff Spicer/Getty Images

For anyone who had their hopes set on Phoebe Waller-Bridge—certified expert on comedy, murder, and hair—transforming James Bond into Hot Priest 2.0 in the upcoming Bond movie, it may be time to disabuse yourself of those expectations. The Fleabag mastermind, who was tapped to spruce up the Bond 25 script by none other than Daniel Craig, isn’t interested in altering 007’s behavior toward women, she told Deadline in a new interview. She just wants the Bond girls to have roles worth playing.

“There’s been a lot of talk about whether or not [the Bond franchise] is relevant now because of who he is and the way he treats women,” Waller-Bridge said. “I think that’s bollocks. I think he’s absolutely relevant now. It has just got to grow. It has just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly. He doesn’t have to. He needs to be true to this character.”

While Waller-Bridge insists that she’s only livening up what’s already in the script, she fortunately will be dedicating her talents to some of Craig’s dialogue. “When I saw his Bond for the first time, there was a wryness to his performance that I really loved,” she said. “So, I was really excited about writing dialogue for him.”

As for the female characters, Waller-Bridge just hopes to make them as meaty and fully formed as actual women. “It’s just about making them feel like real people,” she said. “I always think the test for me as an actor, whenever I’m writing anything, is: Would I want to play that role? And so I’m coming into this polish thinking, I just want to make sure that when they get those pages through, that Lashana [Lynch], Léa [Seydoux] and Ana [de Armas] open them and go, ‘I can’t wait to do that.’ As an actress, I very rarely had that feeling early in my career. That brings me much pleasure, knowing that I’m giving that to an actress.”","“There’s been a lot of talk about whether or not [the Bond franchise] is relevant now because of who he is and the way he treats women,” Waller-Bridge said.

8,"YouTube and Facebook have shown they need regulation. There’s an old, good way to do it.",April Glaser,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images Plus.

That flapping noise you might have heard earlier this week was the sound of YouTube winging it.

On Tuesday night, the video platform said it would not act against one of its users, right-wing talk show host Steven Crowder, in response to the complaints of another, Vox journalist Carlos Maza. Maza had tweeted a super-cut in which Crowder, who has 3.8 million subscribers, repeatedly insulted Maza using homophobic and racist language. Maza also showed that many of Crowder’s fans had subsequently harassed him on social media. After several days, YouTube finally responded, saying it had conducted a thorough review of the videos in question and determined they had not violated its policy against hate speech.

Since I started working at Vox, Steven Crowder has been making video after video ""debunking"" Strikethrough. Every single video has included repeated, overt attacks on my sexual orientation and ethnicity. Here's a sample: pic.twitter.com/UReCcQ2Elj — Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019

(2/4) Our teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don’t violate our policies. We’ve included more info below to explain this decision: — TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) June 4, 2019

Then on Wednesday morning, YouTube announced that as part of a stricter policy against hate speech, it would remove thousands of videos that promote Nazism, white supremacy, and other hateful ideologies that endorse the thinking that one group of people is superior to another. Then, that afternoon, the platform decided to strip Crowder’s YouTube channel of the ability to make money off ads. First, responding to Maza, it said that was because of a homophobic T-shirt Crowder was selling through the shop on his website; then it said the demonetizing was because of other violations of YouTube’s policies on his channel. But YouTube never said how and with what content Crowder broke its rules. Instead, the company seemed to just keep making decisions, letting us know each time it changed its mind.

This incident revealed a lot of things to different people. Conservatives from Ben Shapiro to Sen. Ted Cruz saw more evidence of a Silicon Valley giant curbing conservative speech to mollify its more liberal users. Supporters of Maza railed against YouTube’s indecision amid a clear case of hateful language and harassment. Explaining how YouTube once again was struggling to interpret its own rules, tech critics offered suggestions for better content-moderation policies that it and other platforms might adopt. And it all took place in the shadow of what looks to be an increasingly serious effort by U.S. regulators and lawmakers to crack down on companies like YouTube’s parent Google, which they believe may have used anticompetitive means to achieve such massive scale.

What most everyone would probably agree on is this: Social-media platforms like YouTube are a mess, and every time they try to clean up their mess, they fail in one way or another. It may well be time for the government to do something, but many people assume that any resulting action would be a blow to free speech: Someone is bound to be silenced by over-reaching feds.

But the history of how the U.S. government has regulated mass communication offers another way to understand the issue. Social networks are venues for small-scale communication, but they also serve as 10,000-foot-high podiums where people can broadcast ideas and reach millions in ways never before technologically possible. They’ve consolidated audiences, dominated users’ time, and have come to play a central role in the flow of political information. Once we start to think about the technology like that, social-media platforms look a lot more like communications infrastructure, like radio and television, than they do like a venue for passing notes or publishing casual missives.

For decades, radio and television followed regulations—hardly heavy-handed ones—meant to ensure they served the information needs of their audiences and did not actively harm political discourse. The public may not own the internet the way it does the airwaves, but they’re not completely dissimilar. The internet is a resource that was built by government researchers. Thinking about the largest internet platforms as a kind of infrastructure is a useful place to start considering what light-touch regulation over their broadcasting functions might look like. Social media platforms impact the public interest. And so they should serve it.

It’s easy to recognize the problems with the current nonapproach. YouTube’s continued fumbling is scary because it is one of the most important information sources in the world. It’s the second largest social media network and the second most popular search engine on the internet. Social media is one of the key ways Americans access their news—two thirds of adults in the U.S. use social media to get news. Across the world, people watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube a day. Like radio or television, social media plays a central role in providing people with the information they need to participate meaningfully in political life.

Social networks are venues for small-scale communication, but they also serve as 10,000-foot-high podiums where people can reach millions in ways never before technologically possible.

That the content generally comes from users without centralized editorial oversight is one big difference between social and traditional media. Another key difference between tech platforms and broadcast is that many of the creators with gigantic audiences on YouTube and Facebook peddle in hate speech and dangerous misinformation. It’d be much, much harder for Alex Jones or Laura Loomer or a Russian agent pretending to be an American racist to get a national radio or television show and reach the same audience. So it makes sense that these platforms have are so appealing to bigots, conspiracy theorists, and trolls who have used their megaphones to spread misinformation and hatred. Before social media, where could they find an audience so large? In response, Congress has regularly held hearings over the past two years concerned with the negative externalities of social media, bringing in everyone from CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai to right-wing pseudo-entertainers like Diamond and Silk.

At these hearings, lawmakers have threatened to regulate the industry, which has inspired the platforms to try to self-regulate, though neither thing is actually happening. “I don’t want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God I will,” said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, last year. Just this Monday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeted, “The era of self-regulation is over.” But no one is pointing to a specific piece of legislation or even policy idea. (Other than Sen Elizabeth Warren, who wants to break up Facebook.) On Wednesday, YouTube said it had enacted 30 new user policies in 2018, many of which focused on removing or limiting the spread of hate speech, and yet the site remains a bigot-infested wasteland. In part, that’s because every time YouTube makes a rule, its most odious users figure out how to walk right up to whatever line they now can’t cross.

Lawmakers don’t seem to have a clear sense of what to do here. That’s understandable. Regulating what a company can and cannot host on its site is uncomfortable for a reason: Freedom of speech is really, really important. People who use these platforms to air their hate speech know this, crowing “censorship” every time a company takes some action to limit the spread the spread of bigotry.

One problem with this logic is that private companies can do whatever they want—the First Amendment doesn’t apply to what Facebook allows and does not allow. But if we’re uncomfortable with giving Facebook and YouTube all of that power over how citizens debate, it isn’t crazy to insist that government can play a carefully defined role. It wouldn’t mean that the feds would decide what is and is not acceptable speech on the platforms. But it could mean rules against broadcasting hateful views or disinformation to large audiences. Freedom of speech isn’t the same thing as the freedom to broadcast that speech.

That’s a point lawmakers in the early days of broadcast seemed to understand quite well. The 1934 Communications Act, which created the Federal Communications Commission, mandates that broadcast license holders operate in the “public interest, convenience and necessity” of the communities that they serve. This public interest standard has proven hard to define over the decades. Regulators, industry lobbyists, advocates, and communications scholars have written thousands of pages debating its contours. Before Ronald Reagan became president and took an axe to so many federal regulations over American industries, for decades the FCC required that any entities that were granted a license to broadcast followed certain light-touch rules to ensure they were operating in the interest of their audiences.

These included rules like the fairness doctrine, which required broadcasters dedicate at least some time to covering politically important and controversial issues and that broadcasters do their best to make sure that representatives of various views were able to communicate their positions. Broadcasters were required to devote a certain amount of time to public affairs coverage and had to reduce excessive advertising. There was also a rule in the 1970s that required those with a broadcast license to conduct annual interviews with community leaders, like local clergy, heads of industry, union leaders, and community advocates, and send out random surveys to listeners to ensure the diverse communities they broadcast to were being served by their programming. The public-interest obligation has also been interpreted to require a diversity of ownership of broadcast stations in order to maintain a diversity of viewpoints, which protected against a single company controlling all the radio and television stations in a single market.

In the early 20th century, the U.S. opted to prioritize private access to public airwaves rather than go with of a model that prioritizes public control of the airwaves, like the BBC. Since broadcasters are given a license to use public airwaves, which were essentially free monopoly rights to a public resource off of which they could profit, the logic was to give Americans something back in return. “The idea of the public interest at least implicitly signaled that there is always a kind of market failure—that the market would not entirely take care of our media system, especially in regards to democratic obligations, so there has to be this special category of the public interest,” says Victor Pickard, a professor of media studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of America’s Battle for Media Democracy.

There were two main arguments for placing public interest obligations on broadcasters. One was that the airwaves are scarce. Before the transition to digital broadcasting, there were only so many stations that could operate in one area without causing signal interference. Since the public resource was limited, if you were lucky enough to get a license to use the airwaves, you had to follow certain rules.

These rules were made by politicians who admitted they didn’t understand the technology they were regulating. (Sound familiar?) As Sen. Key Pittman of Nevada put it in 1926, referring to early calls to help police an increasingly crowded radio dial: “I do not think, sir, that in the 14 years I have been here there has ever been a question before the Senate that in the very nature of the thing Senators can know so little about as this subject.” But that didn’t prevent legislators from forming a federal agency—the Federal Radio Commission—to figure something out. Today, arguments that lawmakers are too behind the times to regulate these companies abound, but technological literacy is far less important than understanding the importance of protecting our information systems to keep democracy running smoothly.

The current public interest requirements of broadcasters are nearly unrecognizable compared to the form they took before Reagan-era deregulation—much of the license-renewal process has been reduced to answering a few questions on an online form. Regulating social-media platforms in the exact same way broadcasters were decades ago doesn’t make sense. But the old debates over broadcast could help guide lawmakers grappling with how to rein in the new communications giants of today. They need to acknowledge that the core communications infrastructure that Americans rely on to stay informed should have guardrails to ensure they’re operating, at least at some level, in the interest of the public. In today’s terms, that might mean actual rules against broadcasting hate speech that is sure to reach a large audience—like a channel that has more than a certain large number of subscribers. (If they have fewer, and a platform isn’t boosting them algorithmically, they become less critical to address.) It could mean an obligation to regularly report on efforts to purge viral misinformation or regular reporting on removing foreign and domestic actors who create fake accounts intended to meddle in electoral politics. It could mean clear requirements for handling user data responsibly or not allowing ads that lead to discrimination, like in housing and employment.

Communications infrastructure, particularly when that technology has a broadcast function, is powerful. People are able to use it to misinform and spread hate to an audience in the millions every day. People also rely on social media get information to make decisions about where they’ll send their kids to school, their health care, and who they’ll vote for. Politicians who are thinking now about what to do about the mess that social media has become might find inspiration in policies that guided broadcast technology for decades—policies rooted in an understanding that corporations that want to make as much money as possible will always prioritize profits above all else. Protecting the safety of their users will always come second. That’s where laws are supposed to come in. It’s time we got some.

9,2019 Women’s World Cup: How France became the tournament favorite.,Eric Betts,"Eugenie Le Sommer of France. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Catherine Ivill - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images.

The world’s best women’s soccer team isn’t going to win the 2019 World Cup, but its players might win it for somebody else.

Olympique Lyonnais has won France’s Division 1 Féminine for the past 13 years and the past four Women’s Champions League titles. It features the best player from England (Lucy Bronze), France (Eugénie Le Sommer), Germany (Dzsenifer Marozsán), Japan (Saki Kumagai), and Norway (Ada Hegerberg, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2018 as the world’s top player).

The World Cup is not Space Jam, and Lyon’s team of Monstars will go their separate ways for the tournament (minus Hegerberg, who hasn’t played for her national team since 2017). But beyond the headliners, the club’s impact will be seen in the performance of host nation France, which enters as a co-favorite with the U.S. If the French win the title, they’ll owe as much to their domestic league’s resident superteam as to their host nation advantage.

Lyon employs seven of the top eight French players, including the team’s goalkeeper, three of four likely starters on defense, captain Amandine Henry, and Le Sommer. The spine of the team has essentially been preparing together for this tournament all season, and those months (or years) of additional reps have historically proved invaluable when trying to build a dominant national side.

The famous Hungarian men’s “Golden Team” of the 1950s––Olympic champions in 1952, World Cup runners-up in 1954, and the first foreign opponent to beat the English national team in England––was constructed on a framework of players who had been conscripted by the national service to play for the army’s team Honvéd. The dominant Dutch men’s team of 1974 had a core of players who had won three consecutive European Cups with Ajax. South Korea’s men’s national team spent three months together in a training camp ahead of its home World Cup in 2002 and rode its newfound cohesion (and some fortunate refereeing decisions) all the way to the semifinals.

France is hardly the only European squad to benefit from a core that spends most of its season together. England—fourth favorites behind France, the U.S., and Germany—draws nearly half its squad from Manchester City and Chelsea. Spain, perhaps not a threat to win the 2019 tournament but looking to move closer to contention, features 10 players who ply their trade at Barcelona. By contrast, the U.S. team is scattered among the clubs of the National Women’s Soccer League, with no more than four representatives from any one team and no more than two probable starters.

The U.S. women are hardly strangers. The team has played 30 games together since the beginning of 2018. But the U.S. has held an institutional advantage in the past: the funding to put on long training camps not just immediately before the World Cup, but before the Olympics and tournaments such as the Algarve Cup. That benefit is beginning to erode as investment increases globally. The U.S. team’s Group F opponent Thailand played only 10 games in 2014 before the 2015 World Cup, but its qualification for that tournament inspired the Thai federation to invest more money in developing women’s soccer. In 2018, it played 26 games and qualified for the World Cup for the second time.

The world’s soccer federations still have a long way to go toward resolving the gender pay gap, as evidenced by the U.S. players’ lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, but the disparity of investment is starkest at the club level. The money spent on female players’ salaries was so paltry a year and a half ago that a study found that all the players in the world’s top seven leagues earned about the same as Neymar by himself, approximately $42 million. It’s not hard to see why a committed spender, like Lyon, is able to create a dominant force. (The same isn’t true on the men’s side, where China’s attempt to manufacture a global men’s soccer power has gotten off to a halting start.) The distribution of that money on the women’s side is still uneven enough in many of the big European leagues that the best talent gets funneled to just a couple of clubs with better environments and higher pay scales.

That builds cohesion for those countries’ national teams in the short term, but there is potentially a downside of playing on a superteam. Some suspect that Lyon’s French players aren’t properly battle-tested for a big tournament like the World Cup because they win most of their club games at a jog. If France falls far short of the high standard set by its top club team, then maybe we’ve had it backward. Maybe the national squad is really a feeder team for Lyon.","The world’s best women’s soccer team isn’t going to win the 2019 World Cup, but its players might win it for somebody else.
The World Cup is not Space Jam, and Lyon’s team of Monstars will go their separate ways for the tournament (minus Hegerberg, who hasn’t played for her national team since 2017).
But the U.S. has held an institutional advantage in the past: the funding to put on long training camps not just immediately before the World Cup, but before the Olympics and tournaments such as the Algarve Cup.

10,NYPD Stonewall apology is a distraction from anti-queer police violence today.,Christina Cauterucci,"NYPD officers stand watch during the annual New York City Pride Parade on June 24, 2018 in New York City. ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images

This post is part of Outward, Slate’s home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture Read more here.

On Thursday, NYPD commissioner James P. O’Neill apologized for the force’s harassment of LGBTQ people that led to the Stonewall riots of 1969. Amid pressure from gay New York City Council speaker Corey Johnson, who pointed out in a Wednesday radio interview that the NYPD had apologized for other past offenses, O’Neill issued his statement at a Pride month safety briefing. “I think it would be irresponsible to go through World Pride month and not to speak of the events at the Stonewall Inn in June of 1969,” he said, referencing the international Pride festival coming to New York in the second half of June. “I do know what happened should not have happened. The actions taken by the NYPD were wrong, plain and simple.”

“The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive, and for that, I apologize,” he continued. “I vow to the LGBTQ community that this would never happen in the NYPD in 2019.”

The Stonewall uprising, a major inflection point in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, marks its 50th anniversary this year. On June 28, 1969, NYPD officers raided the Manhattan gay bar and frisked, assaulted, and arrested patrons, as was customary at the time. Hundreds of LGBTQ people arrived on the scene to fight back in protests and acts of physical resistance that lasted days. The riots became a galvanizing moment for gay and trans people who were sick of being expected to accept police harassment as the price of being queer or gender nonconforming in public, and they are the event that the Pride marches were originally organized to commemorate.

In recent years, O’Neill and his predecessor, Bill Bratton, have refused to apologize for the NYPD’s history of violence against LGBTQ people. When asked in June 2017 if he would “apologize for the discrimination and violence” the NYPD perpetrated during the clash at the Stonewall Inn, O’Neill said, “I think that’s been addressed already. … We’re moving forward.” A year earlier, Bratton said of such an apology, “I don’t think that’s necessary. The apology is all that’s occurred since then.” The “terrible experience” queer and trans people suffered at Stonewall ultimately begat “so much good,” he said.

O’Neill was reportedly met with applause when he reversed his stance on Thursday. But it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what his belated contrition will accomplish. The apology will certainly benefit the NYPD, which will enjoy a bump of Pride month goodwill from certain quarters. As for LGBTQ people, however, it’s unclear what a verbal apology for 50-year-old acts of homo- and transphobic violence is supposed to prove. The lesson of Stonewall is not “do not raid Mafia-run gay bars,” which is not really a pressing queer—or cop!—concern in 2019. It’s “do not systemically target, harass, and criminalize LGBTQ and otherwise marginalized communities.”

That’s a lesson the NYPD does not seem to have learned. It took activists years—until this very month—to successfully pressure the department into amending its enforcement of a section of the penal code that criminalizes loitering that may be related to sex work. Officers have been profiling trans women as sex workers under the law, using their clothing and other elements of gender presentation as justification for their arrests. This is just one example of the ways the NYPD, like law enforcement bodies around the country, continues to terrorize and punish LGBTQ people for their identities. Stonewall wasn’t remarkable because of the way the cops on the scene behaved—their physical and verbal abuse were, by all accounts, routine. The riots became historically important because of what the targets of the NYPD’s harassment did in response. To apologize for just this one act out of the NYPD’s many, ongoing acts of LGBTQ criminalization is to miss Stonewall’s entire point.

At this moment in LGBTQ history, activists are mobilizing in increasing numbers to create their own police-free Pride events and get uniformed police officers out of mainstream Pride celebrations. This movement recognizes the fact that, for many LGBTQ people, law enforcement bodies do not protect from, but rather perpetrate, discrimination and violence.

Apologizing for beating queer and trans people, arresting them for wearing the clothes of their choosing, and subjecting them to organized harassment in 1969 is not taking a stance for LGBTQ dignity in 2019. It’s an empty gesture performed far too late to make any meaningful statement on Stonewall, and a slick distraction from the ongoing state violence being perpetrated against LGBTQ people living today.","NYPD officers stand watch during the annual New York City Pride Parade on June 24, 2018 in New York City.

11,Fashionable lateness is a scourge. Parties need arrive-by times.,Shannon Palus,"Photo illustration by Slate. Illustration by Ekaterina Romanova/iStock/Getty Images Plus.

The other week, one of my colleagues was headed to an elopement party that allegedly started at noon. She thought she should probably arrive at noon: Though the couple was already married, the party was still essentially a stand-in celebration for a more traditional wedding, and it’s rude to be late to a wedding. Her husband disagreed, intuiting that this party was low-key enough to arrive after the formal gun time. The fight wasn’t worked out, exactly, but between him not being ready to leave for a bit, and a hunt from parking, they arrived at 12:30. “I was panicked,” my colleague told me. What if their late arrival somehow interrupted their friends’ special day?

It didn’t. In fact, it turned out that some people strolled in even later than they did. But the debate she engaged in with her husband is a common one. Coming to the wrong consensus can mean either burdening a host who wasn’t yet expecting guests or interrupting a thoughtfully timed progression of events. Even when things work out fine, as they did here, there can be a lot of stress (and relationship strain) in the process. But there is a small but meaningful way to improve on this situation: party invitations that spell out precisely when to show up.

Sure, parties have start times. But these are not directives. Arriving exactly on time is actually kind of rude, since that’s valuable time for the host to perfect the playlist and remove anything breakable. Instead, common wisdom holds that you should arrive fashionably late—but how late is fashionable and how late is too late? This is a total mystery. A FiveThirtyEight investigation once found among hundreds of party guests, the median arrival time was “a whopping 58 minutes after the party’s designated start time,” but also that it depended on many factors. In the case of larger parties, for example, the investigation concluded that you should “show up whenever you feel like it,” which still seems too loaded of an action.

Unfortunately, I am not one of those people—I do not want to be regarded as a dweeb.

You might not even know what direction to err on. Maybe the host likes to go to bed early, so you shouldn’t arrive too much after the start. But maybe you don’t know the host that well, so you should avoid arriving too close to the start time, because then you’ll have to make one-on-one small talk. But maybe the party will be quite small, in which case it’s rude to lumber in after everyone has carefully selected a spot in the living room around a cheese board. Which brings us to: Will there be dinner there, even a snack-y kind of dinner like pizza? Because it is terrible, for you, to arrive after the pizza is gone. On the other hand, you don’t want to look like you’re just there to eat dinner!

When it comes to direct advice, plenty of people advocate for arriving pretty close to on time. “If you show up 45 minutes late for a 45-year-old’s party they will hate you,” according to a colleague who is presumably either 45 or has had a harrowing experience with a 45-year-old. As Jen Doll wrote in a guide to attending parties for the New York Times, “the very best time to get there is right when the party starts,” because that’s when it’s easiest to mingle. This is good advice for some people, people who are bold enough to follow it. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people—I do not want to be regarded as a dweeb.

The clear logical solution to this collective-action problem is invitations that specify both a start time, as they do now, and an “arrive by” time. (If you want everyone to be on time, these can be the same thing.) If this seems overbearing, consider that we already spell out the etiquette with other parties. It’s commonplace for the gift situation to be clearly dictated, e.g., “no gifts,” or “accepting donations on behalf of Planned Parenthood,” or “we are honeymooning in the Maldives, can you basically Venmo us?” Many invitations even take a swing at a suggestion of how to dress, particularly if the occasion is more formal. (Additional note: Any deployment of the words cocktail attire should be hyperlinked to photos of example outfits.)

Really, in the age of electronic invitations, providing instructions to guests is easier than ever. You’re not limited to the information you can fit on a card or a flier. Your email or Facebook (well, please no) invite can also include details on what time various other parts of the party will occur. It’s true that as we adjust to the new world order, you will have to be very clear that when you put an “arrive by” time on your invite, you mean it. While you’re at it, consider putting an end time, too, so guests will know when to see themselves out. Even more fraught than a guest who shows up at the wrong time is the one you have to explicitly tell to leave.","Her husband disagreed, intuiting that this party was low-key enough to arrive after the formal gun time.

12,Why the Heck Did Rocketman Totally Skip the ’90s?,Heather Schwedel,"Photo illustraiton by Slate. Photos by Paramount and Disney.

According to the movie Rocketman, which purports to tell the life story of Elton John, John didn’t exist between 1983 and roughly now-ish. I take issue with this: I remember the ’90s and can attest to the fact that Elton John was there the whole time. You wouldn’t know it from the movie, however, which skips right from the early ’80s to essentially the present day with one of those post-film real-life photo slideshows to reveal that John is now happily married with two children and a meant-to-be-a-joke-I-think shopping addiction. I’m convinced that this is both an artistic and commercial mistake and that the movie’s story should have extended at least into the ’90s.

In its current incarnation, Rocketman covers Elton John’s childhood, his rise to fame, his glory days, and his descent into addiction and self-destruction, with a framing device of John looking back from rehab. The ending is spectacularly anticlimactic: Taron Egerton, as John, monologues about all he’s learned and sings “I’m Still Standing,” which, while thematically appropriate, is no one’s favorite Elton John song. It’s no way to end a movie! Everyone knows you have to have a big closing number that brings the house down. Also, hello, it’s only 1983, what a weird place to stop the story! To apply the logic of Seinfeld, one can’t “yada, yada” 35 years. We were there; it happened; it was eventful.

Ending a story on a high note when it’s a biopic about a star whose heyday is behind him presents a narrative challenge—but only if one takes it as a given that John’s heyday was behind him by the rest of the ’80s and beyond. Surely this film doesn’t want to look like it buys into the false premise that it’s all downhill after youth? Plus, John was such a strong cultural presence in the ’90s, a fixture on red carpets and at awards shows, that it seems bizarre not to include those years in any film about his life. John went Hollywood by writing the music for The Lion King, which went from blockbuster movie to legendary hit Broadway musical. “Candle in the Wind 1997,” the rewritten song he released in tribute to Princess Diana after her death, became one of the bestselling singles in history and a crucial cultural moment. Both “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” and “Candle,” at least, deserve to be musical numbers in the best version of this movie. Would they stick out tonally from the rest of it? Perhaps, but our only fealty must be to art and truth.

To apply the logic of Seinfeld, one can’t “yada, yada” 35 years.

Besides, baby boomers may know John as a star from the 1970s, but to millennials, he was the Lion King and “Candle in the Wind” guy. Can you say cross-demo appeal? Throw the millennials a scene of John meeting Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the voice of Simba, on the red carpet—they’ll eat it up! There’s also ample opportunity to depict John’s many famous, and zeitgeist-y, friends and enemies. Without getting too Lifetime-y, I would love to see his feud with Madonna portrayed on screen. Leaving it out is honestly an insult to Pride Month. Plus, the ’90s are also when John met his husband. A third-act love story? Yes, please!

The only real problem I can see is how to wring more recognizable musical numbers out of these last three decades, which, while productive, do lack as many chart-topping hits of earlier periods in John’s career. Then I had a good idea, which is that John should just write a new hit song to go with this movie. Seems about as doable as all the other changes I’m requesting. Please let me know.","According to the movie Rocketman, which purports to tell the life story of Elton John, John didn’t exist between 1983 and roughly now-ish.

13,Should This Thing Be Smart? Nest x Yale smart door lock edition.,Justin Peters,"The Next x Yale smart door lock. Photo illustration by Slate.

In Should This Thing Be Smart?, Justin Peters examines a smart object and tries to determine whether there is any good reason for its existence. Previously on Should This Thing Be Smart?: the $60 smart fork, the $199 smart socks, the $80 coffee mug, the $99 button, the $99 toothbrush, the $99 dog collar, the $1,199 mirror, the $199 bike lock, the $60 microwave, the $130 Christmas lights, and the $350 self-lacing sneakers.

On Sunday, an important slice of the internet was rendered inoperable when Google Cloud services went down without warning. For several hours, millions of affected users found themselves unable to access YouTube, Snapchat, their Gmail accounts, various Shopify storefronts, and, in some cases, even their homes. Google owns a company called Nest, which makes internet-connected thermostats, security cameras, and door locks, among other things. The company’s smart door lock, called Nest x Yale Lock, claims to provide unparalleled security and convenience for users—a premise that was rendered somewhat risible on Sunday. “Can’t use my Nest lock to let guests into my house. I’m pretty sure their infrastructure is hosted in Google Cloud,” wrote one poster on the website Hacker News.

Predictably, many online commentators reacted to this snafu by snarking over the very notion of a smart door lock that lacks a physical-key fail-safe to be used in case of emergency. But it’s worth noting that the lock itself worked fine during the cloud outage; what was really affected was the paired app. Nest x Yale Lock users could still access their homes by inputting their existing passcodes on the lock’s numerical keypad. The people who found themselves or their tenants locked out on Sunday had either not yet issued passcodes to their houseguests, forgotten their own passcodes, or simply didn’t pass those codes along to the people who were using their home.

It’s easy and fun to mock expensive tech gizmos when they fail in situations where the nonsmart devices they replaced would have continued to work. But it’s more interesting to interrogate these products during their most visible failures to try to figure out why they exist in the first place. Should a door lock be smart? Let’s find out!

Product: Nest x Yale Lock

Price: $219 on Nest.com; $249 bundled with Nest Connect, which you sort of need in order for this lock to work.

The case for the smart door lock: A collaboration between Nest and the long-lived lock company Yale, the smart lock aims to free the world’s door users from the tyranny of keys. Like the smart bike lock I covered last year, the Nest x Yale Lock is a product largely made for the sharing economy, in this case for people who “share” their dwellings with strangers, for money, via short-term rentals on sites like Airbnb, HomeAway, VRBO, and LetsMakeOurNeighborsHateUs.com, which I assume is the site that my upstairs neighbor uses to rent his unit out to an endless succession of smelly-garbage-generating weeknight partiers.

Standard-issue keys don’t always cut it for these residential entrepreneurs. For one thing, it can be inconvenient and frustrating to wait around at odd hours to hand off a physical key to a vacation tenant. Just leave the key under the mat or in a lockbox, you say? Sure, you could do that, but a short-term renter could end up losing the key anyway, or forgetting to give it back, or surreptitiously copying it with larcenous intent, or swallowing it as part of some odd Houdini tribute act to be performed loudly on a weeknight in the unit just above mine.

The smart door lock offers a solution to these very 21st-century problems. You, the homeowner, use the Nest app to generate a four- to eight-digit numerical code, which is then shared with the renter. The renter, standing at the door, opens it by punching in a code on the lock’s numerical keypad. Once verified, the deadbolt pops open and the party begins. This code-based system allows landlords to give their tenants access to their units for the duration of their rental and revoke it by changing the code as soon as that rental ends. Moreover, the app’s remote-access feature means that you can lock and unlock your internet-connected door from anywhere in the world. Paris! Modesto! The bottom of a well, assuming you can get service down there!

The smart door lock isn’t just for side-hustling sublessors who are slowly destroying the fabric of their neighborhoods. Perhaps you, a nervous sort, went on vacation and want to have your neighbor pop over to double-check that the stove is off. Perhaps you’re at work and need to let a cleaning person or a plumber into your house. Maybe you left your house in a late-for-the-train rush one morning and forget to lock your door. No worries! The smart door lock will help pick up the slack during those times when you have been very stupid.

A smart home is ultimately defenseless against its dumbest residents.

The Nest x Yale Lock’s paired app is multifunctional. You can use it to program your door to automatically lock itself after a certain period of time. If, for whatever reason, you are a keypad-averse door user, then you can just tap a button on the app and the door will unlock—no keypad required! The app is also voice-compatible with your Google Assistant, which means that you can lock the door while simultaneously eating ribs, or some other messy foodstuff that requires both of your hands. Can you lock your door with a plain old key while simultaneously eating ribs? No, you cannot. (“Note: You can’t unlock the Nest × Yale Lock using voice commands,” the Nest website stipulates. As anyone who has ever seen the movie Sneakers will tell you, this is probably wise.)

The case against the smart door lock: Well, Sunday’s Google Cloud outage is itself a pretty good case against the lock, isn’t it? Yes, the outage didn’t last for long; yes, the locks were still accessible by means of preexisting passcodes. Even so, the incident illuminated the risks we all run when we replace dumb objects with smart ones and insert third parties into heretofore simple interactions.

The humble door lock is one of the least-obtrusive, most-effective objects on earth. You probably don’t give much thought to the lock on your front door, except for the cumulative 14 seconds per day when you are using it. That’s the sign of a useful, unobtrusive product: It’s there when you need to use it, it works when you need to use it, and it makes no further demands on your time. But when you buy and install the smart door lock, your lock is no longer just “your lock.” It’s your “Nest x Yale Lock,” and it’s part of your “Nest home,” which means that it will only fully work in tandem with other Nest products that you will have to install. Its efficacy becomes tethered to the cloud. You can’t even use a key as a fail-safe.

By turning your previously dumb lock into an interactive, branded experience, the Nest x Yale Lock creates a suite of new vulnerabilities that might end up complicating your door-opening experience. The lock’s batteries might fail, forcing you to find a 9-volt battery to “jump-start” the lock so that you can get into your house. Google Cloud might go down, thus complicating your efforts to grant access to moneyed strangers. You might forget to set a passcode or forget to memorize it. You might, I don’t know, leave the Nest app open on your phone, and then sit on your phone or something, thus locking your door when you didn’t mean to do so. Hackers might breach your lock somehow. Nest might change its terms of service in an annoying way. Your rowdy kid might spill some grape juice on your Nest Connect device, thus disrupting its connection with your lock. You might accidentally drop your phone down a well.

You get the idea. When the smart door lock fails you, the experience will seem infinitely more aggravating than it would have if you had been using a regular old lock—because you will know in your heart that the Nest x Yale Lock was a frivolous and unnecessary purchase. You thought you could improve upon the timeworn, mutually beneficial relationship between humans and dumb machines, and you will have been wrong. When you try to Icarus your deadbolt, you’ll have only yourself to blame if you end up getting burned.

Though the Nest x Yale Lock will help save your butt during those times when you forgot to lock your door, it won’t do a damn thing to help if you carelessly leave your door wide open. “The Nest × Yale Lock can only turn the deadbolt. It won’t close the door for you,” the website notes. Pfft! The smart lock is lazy.

The smart door lock cannot be used on glass doors or sliding doors, according to the Nest website, which is a real bummer for those of us who live that sweet, sweet patio lifestyle.

Security concerns: What happens to the data that is generated by your cloud-connected deadbolt? There are obvious security concerns around the prospect of generating a record of your entrances and exits from your home. If an app—the Nest x Yale Lock app or another one—knows when you are and are not at home, then it is theoretically possible for unscrupulous third parties to access that information, project when you won’t be home, and then literally break into your house. Just as concerning is the prospect of hackers taking your lock offline, or gaining access to your deadbolt by dishonest means. A smart lock can be socially engineered just as easily as a stupid one; a smart home is ultimately defenseless against its dumbest residents.

Is the smart door lock more likely to be used to solve or commit a crime? It is more likely to be used to inspire the crime of physically assaulting your upstairs neighbor who won’t stop Airbnbing his apartment to loud, disrespectful jerks.

Should this thing be smart? This thing should not be smart. We observe an implicit social compact with many of the household objects we use on a daily basis. Your dresser, your mailbox, your step stool: These objects agree to just work every single time we use them, and we agree to not bother to disrupt them. Why disrupt a mailbox? What’s the point? You buy it, you install it, and then it lasts for the next 40 years, or until some rowdy teens smash it. This arrangement works pretty well for all concerned. The Nest x Yale Lock disrupts this social compact. Though it claims to simplify the interaction between lock and door user, in reality it serves to complicate that interaction by involving an assortment of third parties and by making the interaction a branded experience. Sometimes, low-tech solutions are the best solutions.

15,Why Atheists and Agnostics Should Embrace Today’s Gospel Music,Carl Wilson,"Kirk Franklin performs onstage at the 2019 Super Bowl Gospel Celebration on Jan. 31 in Atlanta. Rick Diamond/Getty Images for BET

“Religion is a prison, but truth sets us free,” Kirk Franklin declaimed on the rat-a-tat-tat title track of his racially and politically incensed 2015 album, Losing My Religion. That’s the bait, here’s the switch: Franklin—as a (deep inhale) composer-lyricist-arranger-producer-conductor-impresario who fronts choirs and bands as a combination preacher-rapper–hype man—is one of the dominant figures of the past quarter-century in gospel music. His music, which has won 13 Grammys, features swelling harmonies, anguished testimonials, and infectious rhythmic chants, but always with a streetwise contemporary attitude and, usually, backing that brings the funk. Losing My Religion has spent 166 weeks (and counting) on the Billboard gospel album chart, 16 of them at No. 1, and also made the top 10 on the R&B and pop album charts. “Love Theory,” the advance single from this week’s new Long Live Love album, is currently in its 18th week atop the gospel chart. Franklin is also a leading architect of gospel-to-mainstream crossover, hand in hand with huge names in unholy hip-hop and pop.

So was he losing his religion? Nah. What he was doing in that monologue was hustling sidelong to the progressive evangelical commonplace that organized religions, as creations of mere mortals, should not be venerated above a believer’s personal relationship with the Almighty and compassion for the downtrodden. “I’m losing my religion, thank God!” he rounded it off. “Helping you lose yours is my job.” (Always fond of a pop-culture name check, Franklin also shouted out the band he bit his title from.)

Still, if a proposition like “religion is a prison”—or, later on that album, a holy-ghostly sample of a crowd chanting “Black lives matter!”—scandalized any of his core churchy audience and helped lure any nonbelievers like me, that suits Franklin’s divine plan just fine. He often says his mission on this plane is to “make God famous.” Proof of concept came when his 1996 song “Stomp,” with his group God’s Property and a guest rap by Salt of Salt-N-Pepa, nudged the top of the charts neck and neck with Biggie Smalls and Puff Daddy, and the video went into heavy rotation on Mammon’s own MTV. Stones were thrown by purists who didn’t want to witness New Jack Swing beats and hip-hop streetwear sullying their songs of praise. But between Franklin and his urban-gospel peers, such as Bebe and Cece Winans, those new recipes gradually became daily bread for many houses of worship.

Today Franklin is called on to comment whenever scuffles break out around new-minted sounds like “trap gospel.” He’s reliably enthusiastic. He may lead choirs, but he’s never been content to preach only to them. Though he led Christian music services from the time he was a prodigal teen, he also lived rough on the streets of Fort Worth, Texas, for a while after exhausting the patience of his devout aunt Gertrude, who took him in after both parents bailed on him as a toddler. He gets who needs ministering to the most. But there’s another kind of hunger he can’t quite shut down. As the dapper, driven dynamo he is even at age 49, Franklin has a worldly star quality he struggles to quell for humility’s sake. Half the fun is watching him fail.

Whether you think religion’s a prison or a paradise, that’s a fun I’ll argue you should experience. Maybe even need to. And by providence or coincidence, right now I have some curious cultural momentum on my side.

Franklin’s M.O. was too familiar by 2015 for much of anyone to mistake his intent with a track like “Losing My Religion.” But he soon found another way to confound the pious: He was discovered consorting with Kanye West. As Franklin revealed last month, he’d been in private communion since 2012 with the (for starters) foul-mouthed, blasphemous rap imp. But he’d declined offers to collaborate, worrying they’d each be misunderstood, and maybe that West’s level of stardom could lead him into temptation himself. But then came “Ultralight Beam,” the radiant curtain-raiser to Ye’s 2016 album The Life of Pablo, and Franklin found himself unable to resist an invitation to add his own vocal arrangements. He even dropped a spoken benediction at the end of the song’s tonal rainbow. Next, he joined West and Chance the Rapper on Saturday Night Live to repeat that prayer over Kanye’s prone, writhing body onstage.

Kirk Franklin may lead choirs, but he’s never been content to preach to them.

The outcry from gospel circles forced him to defend their dalliance. But he’s stayed loyal even through West’s subsequent, troubling MAGA-hat phase. Franklin makes sure to say he can’t co-sign his wayward friend’s antics, but that God doesn’t cancel anybody.

Franklin didn’t stop there. In 2016, he also contributed to his super-fan Chance’s acclaimed mixtape Coloring Book. Those two collaborations, along with the outpouring following the death of Aretha Franklin (no relation) in 2018—with her gospel-packed, marathon homegoing service, followed by the release of her long-lost live concert film Amazing Grace—seem to have heralded a new morning for gospel in the mainstream. With Kirk Franklin smack in the thick of it.

Last fall, for instance, none other than Snoop Dogg released Bible of Love, a 32-track album stuffed with sacred music stars that jumped right to the roof of the gospel chart. Franklin then chatted with the porn-producing, weed-devouring ex-gangsta about gospel in a trio of videos sponsored by BET. Franklin also joined forces with Pharrell Williams on the inspirational track “I See a Victory” for the movie Hidden Figures, featuring gospel star Kim Burrell. (Williams already had pitched in a remix of Franklin’s “123 Victory” for Losing My Religion.)

Meanwhile, outside Franklin’s purview, unlikely figures such as rappers Nicki Minaj and T.I. have been turning up as featured guests on gospel-charting songs, and Christian rapper NF had a 2018 mainstream hit with his track “Let You Down.” And that’s not to mention Kendrick Lamar, who could pass as a Christian artist save that he won’t trim back his contradictions to fit anyone else’s catechism.

This year, West himself, perhaps in a repenting mood, has gone back to gospel, with the series of weekly, invitation-only “Sunday Service” events he began hosting in January at Casa Kardashian-West, and then then on a grander scale Easter morning at Coachella. Williams, for his part, also incorporated a Sunday “Pop-Up Church” into his Something in the Water festival last month in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with Franklin on hand.

These upticks for gospel come along on an irregular cycle. There was the late 1960s and early 1970s with Edwin Hawkins (“Oh Happy Day”), the Staple Singers, and of course Aretha—with Simon and Garfunkel (“Bridge Over Troubled Water”) and the Beatles (“Let It Be”) clambering non-believingly aboard. You can find the professor-preacher-pundit Michael Eric Dyson fretfully watching gospel coming “out of the church, into the streets” in the New York Times in 1991, just before Franklin himself arrived at the party. And in a sense, too, sacred music never entirely exits the spotlight. Not as long as Grammy and Oscar broadcast producers remain committed to gussying up awards-show performances with unearned profundity by throwing in choirs-for-hire.

On this go-around, is it people grasping for faith in turbulent times? No doubt, but gospel’s mini-boom also feels like an outgrowth of music audiences’ growing agnosticism on genre. Online, streaming means there’s little to lose in opening your ears to every species of sound, especially with a familiar face’s say-so. And with hip-hop’s ascension to the status of reigning caliph of all genres, its tent is swelling, as rock’s did at its zenith, to admit a greater diversity of styles, slants, and aspirations, even celestial ones.

For a portion of us, though, in-your-face God talk can still be one of the higher lyrical hurdles.

As a child, my first exposure to religious music was at the Catholic church my third-generation Irish-Canadian mother dutifully but far from fervently carted me and my brother off to on Sundays. The singing of the choir was only slightly less wan than the parishioners’, and most of the hymns were post–Vatican II numbers that in the name of vernacular accessibility had been stripped of the mystique of their stuffier but more opulent forebears. What I really liked, and lobbied for, was when we’d drive across town to the newer church with the funky architecture, where there was a folk choir with acoustic guitar and tambourines. They played happy-clappy post-hippie hymns that sounded like (and sometimes were) songs from Godspell or Hair and tended to be much more about brother/sisterhood and love-love-love than about serving heavenly Fathers. (My dad, for his part, didn’t go to church.) The congregation there sang along with gusto.

But when I chanced on more serious-minded sacred music, I found it kind of scary. I contracted a serious case of the creeps when I spent a couple of summer weeks between grades six and seven, already a doubter, staying with my cousins’ much more traditional, large Catholic family in Toronto. On longer car trips, instead of license-plate-spotting games, my aunt would break up the monotony by having us collectively recite the rosary, which I was embarrassed to admit I didn’t even how to do. Then she would put on the most eerie religious music I’d ever heard. I realize now that it was one of Johnny Cash’s 1970s Southern-gospel albums, probably 1973’s The Gospel Road, which featured creaky baritone biblical recitations that sounded to my fallen ears like Halloween. This wasn’t the coolly assertive Man in Black, beloved of every music fan today, but the God-fearing Depression-reared Arkansas apostle. That shivery timbre fused in my memory with the day my aunt sent me to confession at their church. Instead of the quick trade of minor misdemeanors for a slack penance that I was used to, this priest gravely admonished that masturbation (which I hadn’t brought up) would damn my soul to hell. I had to say so many Hail Marys.

I feel guilty now about how medieval I judged my relatives’ quite ordinary faith to be. But back then, even regular country music was alien to that sheltered little nerd. Mocking evangelical preachers was a staple of the comedy and rock music I heard. Growing up in the Reagan 1980s with the cresting power of the religious right, you knew you were on their enemies list as a liberal unbeliever, so they were on yours too. And the radical underground culture I was discovering at the library and the record store, and was intent on joining as I moved into young adulthood, was sneeringly anti-religion as a matter of principle. Blasphemy was doctrine.

That didn’t mean excluding all faith-based art—few of us were deluded enough to dismiss the reverberations of black gospel, with its clear through-line to R&B and rock ’n’ roll. (For a primer on that history, I highly recommend the special podcast series that NPR and partners released in February, Gospel Roots of Rock and Soul, hosted by Cece Winans.) And we’d accept it when it came mixed with the sexy and secular, as from Aretha or Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder, or with the floridly strange, the way scratchy prewar folk, blues, and country gospel often sounded to urban ears that conflated “old” with “weird.”

What raised hackles for me then was any new music, especially pop music, that seemed too churchy, for instance Whitney Houston. And while U2’s all-too-obvious Christianity may not have been the main reason I disdained them, it’s not like it wasn’t on the list. The worst, though, was whenever an artist we loved fell into a “religious phase.” The ur-case (a bit before my time) being Bob Dylan’s late-1970s fundamentalist conversion, when his songs suddenly turned into fire-and-brimstone sermons.

But in the early 2000s, when I heard an amazing collection of traditional gospel choirs doing Dylan’s holy rock ’n’ rollers, called Gotta Serve Somebody, I had the revelation that whatever their content, many of those songs were musically rapturous. That revisionist impulse has become widespread among fans and critics, reinforced recently when Sony’s ongoing official Dylan Bootleg Series gathered together even stronger examples of the period on 2017’s Vol. 13: Trouble No More, 1979-81. And of course the whole incident was consistent with Dylan’s compulsion to kick listeners’ feet from under them and contradict any consensus version of him that took hold. Getting outraged about it was to be as suckered as the notorious concertgoer who yelled “Judas!” after Dylan went electric.

If you are concerned (or perhaps hoping) that I’m building to a confession of a road-to-Damascus moment, rest easy. It’s not that I found God but that I finally, slow-wittedly, figured out a couple of basic facts.

First, that given the eons of deep integration of religion in human culture, any urge to avoid music (or literature, film, theater, etc.) with prominent theological content means cutting out of your life vast swaths of the greatest art ever made. I don’t imagine many people are reading this who can’t stand Bach, Michelangelo, Mahalia Jackson, or the canonical music of many other cultures around the globe because of “all the God stuff.” So it’s logically absurd to apply a different test to what’s newer and more nearby. Neither is religion monolithic, as in the caricature I bought into in my youth. While the religious right is sponsoring abusive abortion bans, other churches are volunteering as sanctuary spaces for immigrants (who bring their own religious values with them), offering aid to the poor, and just helping people endure the emotional brunt of everyday life. Ignoring that would be to make of anti-religion a religion, the way that the tedious “new atheists” did a few years back, and to strap on another set of blinders.

Any urge to avoid music with prominent religious content means cutting out of your life vast swaths of the greatest art ever made.

And second, the more grown-up fact about art is that it’s not there for you to agree with. There’s nothing wrong with looking for art that validates and confirms your identity and worldview. It can be lifesaving. But it’s too limited always to require it. It’s counterproductive to the crucial claim that one of art’s great purposes is to bring us places we’ve never been, to encounter other minds, and to foster empathy across difference. Casting objectionable religious material out of your cultural diet is too similar to the “forbidden” lists of artwork that churches have imposed on their constituents, leaving teens hiding books and records under their beds. Seeking the worth in art that discomfits you—while vigorously criticizing its faults—isn’t a social studies sideline to your culturally engaged existence. It’s a basic plank of the platform.

Whatever a work of art is nominally “about” is minuscule compared to what it does, how it creates its unpredictable effects. Listen to any of the compilations of raw old-time gospel to which the connoisseur and critic Mike McGonigal has dedicated years of his life for an instant demonstration. Better yet, consider whether any feminist, queer-positive (etc., etc.) listener could cope with the history of hip-hop without tolerating some very dodgy shit in the interest of affirming the restless, burrowing drilling of that art form through the hypocrisies of American life. Being a white boho fossil who listens to rap helped train me to be an atheist who can listen to contemporary Christian songs. All told, do I “agree” with, say, Future or Rico Nasty so much more solidly than I “agree” with Kirk Franklin? No, and who cares? By that measure, I’d be confined to the likes of Kendrick and Noname and lose the plot altogether.

While Franklin himself has been righteous on many social justice matters that make more conservative congregants uncomfortable, he has been mealy-mouthed about LGBTQ issues, usually landing on some subtler variation on “love the sinner and hate the sin,” though I think there’s cause for hope he’s evolving past it. Ironically enough, as the great gospel chronicler Anthony Heilbut outlined in his essay “The Children and Their Secret Closet,” church music has often served as refuge and sustenance for gay and lesbian members of those communities. My colleague Ann Powers makes an even broader case in her 2017 book Good Booty: Love and Sex, Black and White, Body and Soul in American Music that gospel’s effect always has been erotic in a feminine way, with its mounting climaxes that tease and diminish and then rise again, arousing the urges of the body to serve the needs of the soul.

And of course for Americans, gospel has too much history echoing in it to ignore—a nation’s sins and tragedies reaching out for rescue. James Baldwin was a teenage preacher, and though as a politicized gay adult he left the church behind, he still yearned for those vibrations. As he wrote in 1962, “There is no music like that music, no drama like the drama of the saints rejoicing, the sinners moaning, the tambourines racing, and all those voices coming together and crying holy unto the Lord. There is still, for me, no pathos quite like the pathos of those multicolored, worn, somehow triumphant and transfigured faces, speaking from the depths of a visible, tangible, continuing despair of the goodness of the Lord.”

How can you read that and not want to know what sounds are coming from those churches’ successors in the 21st century?

I know that long before this point, readers who grew up in deep faith cultures have been rending their garments, protesting, Yeah, how dense can you be? But for much of secular America, the impression persists that gospel is an artifact of the past. As NPR’s series, beautifully done as it is, suggests by leaving its narrative off in about the 1970s, it was where rock and soul came from, but who needs that anymore? But outside of privileged music-education institutions, the church is still where many black musicians, among countless others, get their start. Listen to Snoop Dogg explaining his motivation to make Bible of Love to Franklin: “Gangsta rap comes from gospel music. … Ninety-five percent of the gangster rappers were born and raised in a church, and the first style of music that they heard or were introduced to was church music. … That’s why, you notice, when every gangsta rapper wins an award, what’s the first thing they say?”

Tensions between profane and sacred, between the charitable and the for-profit, have been a widening gyre in the engine room of gospel ever since its inauguration. In the 1920s and 1930s, Thomas A. Dorsey, under the name of “Georgia Tom,” was writing bawdy hits for the brothels of Chicago, while penning hymns like the Magna Carta of modern gospel, “Take My Hand, Precious Lord.” Church-raised but worldly-attracted artists have had to navigate backlashes all over the compass for generations. Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Clara Ward were chastised for playing rock and jazz clubs. The soul generation was given the evil eye by many elders for selling out to the devil’s music (and some, like Al Green, eventually came back to the church again). It’s a brawl whenever someone crosses over. Meanwhile many artists, however strong their faith, chafe under both that artistically restrictive pressure from within and the stigma against goody-goodies in the commercial world. Just this January, hip-hop cult favorite Lecrae published an essay explaining why he didn’t want to be called a “Christian rapper” anymore.

For much of secular America, the impression persists that gospel is an artifact of the past.

As for Franklin’s own new record, Long Live Love, there’s little sign of the genre-jumping boldness that not only agitated fans in 2016 but marks his best albums, such as the 1997’s God’s Property From Kirk Franklin’s Nu Nation, 1998’s follow-up Nu Nation Project, 2005’s bracingly personal Hero, or the uncompromising oomph of Losing My Religion itself. Long Live Love isn’t a bad record, musically or morally, but many of its highlights are buried in codas after extended shows of piety. Overall, it feels like his nerve has been chastened by getting too near to the flame of pop culture—who could blame him, given how exposed he became to Kanye’s multimedia meltdown? It feels like a tactical retreat.

Still, even here there’s plenty to savor for us unbelievers. Opener “F.A.V.O.R.,” for instance, is a thorough demonstration of how rousing Franklin’s group jams can be, where the words don’t have to stand in your way one iota. “Strong God” is one of his better blends of dissent and deaconry (“The government keep lyin’ to me/… Heaven, please, we’re in a state of emergency”), with the same kind of prismatic harmonies that saturated “Ultralight Beam.” On the outro to “Spiritual,” which up till then is enervatingly pious, the music fades back in with a New Orleans jazz reprise that, all too briefly, summons the ancestors from their graves to witness their descendants keeping the greater faith of American pop. And “Father Knows Best,” its patriarchally suspect title notwithstanding, soars through an effortless-feeling six and a half minutes with crisp choral parts that wrap dizzily around your ears, plus Earth, Wind & Fire horns, barrelhouse piano, and Franklin keeping the spirit up throughout with his shouts and exhortations. You won’t be sweating whether you endorse the message when the groove transports you out the window and into a better day.

Franklin is far from the only captivating presence on the contemporary gospel scene—younger blood is always on the come-up, and I have a lot more exploring to do myself. As that big old book of ripping tales, bad ideas, and some bona fide eternal verities puts it in Psalm 24, “Lift up your heads, you gates/ And be lifted up, you ancient doors.” Ideologically, religion may be a prison. But artistically, all kinds of truths can set people free.","That’s the bait, here’s the switch: Franklin—as a (deep inhale) composer-lyricist-arranger-producer-conductor-impresario who fronts choirs and bands as a combination preacher-rapper–hype man—is one of the dominant figures of the past quarter-century in gospel music.
Losing My Religion has spent 166 weeks (and counting) on the Billboard gospel album chart, 16 of them at No.
Then she would put on the most eerie religious music I’d ever heard.

Dear Care and Feeding,

I’m looking for some different perspectives on whether to talk to my kids’ baseball coach about the things I’m hearing from the sidelines.

Let me start by saying that I really appreciate how much energy and work these volunteers put into our kids’ team. There are four parent coaches for a team of 9- to 10-year-olds. What I’m concerned about is the really intense coaching from the sidelines by the coaches. Though most of it is positive and constructive, I’m also hearing things like “Keep it simple, stupid” and “Move your asses.” All at top volume, and throughout the entire game!

My kids claim not to be bothered by what they hear, but it feels way too intense to me. Do I talk to the head coach? Do I just talk to my kids? An additional wrinkle: My husband is also an assistant coach but is much more mellow. Should I have him talk to the other coaches?

—Or Just Sit Back and Enjoy the Game

Dear OJSBaEtG,

Oh, boy. Yeah, you call my kid stupid, we’re going to have words. And “stupid” and “asses” are just completely inappropriate things to be yelling at 9- to 10-year-olds. We are not remaking Hoosiers, we’re having a good time with our middle-schoolers. Nor is this a situation where the losing team is to be culled to preserve food resources on a dying dystopian planet.

I would first talk to my kids (it sounds as though you already have), and tell them they should not pay any attention to those words, because the coaches who use them are being overzealous. Kids love being told they can ignore an adult. It’ll go fine. (Make sure you confirm they do listen and comply with noninsulting requests by their coaches.)

Then, I would have your husband email the other coaches. (I firmly believe this is not a cop-out; emailing someone instead of having a big group face-to-face allows people to go through their mad-defensive-explanatory phase on their own time, and gives things time to simmer.) He can just say (accurately) that he has heard from parents that they really don’t want the phrases you have mentioned to be used anymore, and We’re Here to Have Fun, It’s Just a Game, Billy Martin, etc.

Orange slices for all!

Dear Care and Feeding,

We love my daughter’s day care center. The teachers are incredible, the principal is amazing, the classrooms are very diverse, it’s actually affordable (!!!), and it’s five minutes from my and my husband’s offices. Literally the only downside to this place is that it follows the academic year, so we have to find alternate child care for the summer.

We were ecstatic when one of the school’s teachers agreed to watch our daughter in her home this summer. The teacher, I’m going to call her Zoe, is very warm and sweet, and my more reserved 2-year-old really clicks with her. Zoe has a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old, and we were excited about my daughter spending time with kids of different ages. We’re three weeks in, and my daughter is having a blast. She is excited to go to Zoe’s every morning, and is becoming good friends with the 4-year-old.

The problem is screen time. My husband and I allow my daughter very little screen time at home, and the day care center has a policy of no more than 30 minutes of screen time per week. Aside from a handful of family movie nights, a very occasional “OK, you can watch a clip from Moana” potty training incentive, and some screen time during road trips, she has had no screen time at all.

We’re more strict about screen time than any parents I know, which I absolutely realize is related to the privilege we have as a two-parent household with one kid. I get that parents in other situations sometimes need screen time to get things done, and we certainly have our own parenting compromises in other areas. I promise we very rarely (if ever) discuss screen time with other parents. We try very hard not to be sanctimonious about this: It’s important to us, but we try not to be assholes.

In the three weeks our daughter has been at Zoe’s house, she’s watched some TV every day. Once (on a rainy day) it was an entire movie, though more typically it seems to be a couple episodes of a half-hour show. It’s often at the end of the day, just before pickup, and my husband and I both feel like it’s affecting her behavior. It’s often really hard to get her to leave Zoe’s house, because she’s glued to the TV. She seems to be both more emotional and hyperactive when she comes home for the evening, which makes bedtime tougher, too. Plus we just don’t like that she’s getting so much screen time, based on all the research that it’s bad for kids.

Zoe does an amazing job getting the kids outside, and they go on daily adventures around the neighborhood or to nearby parks. They also make crafts together and read. We just found out that Zoe will be our daughter’s classroom teacher in the fall, which we know will make for a great transition back to the center for our daughter. We really like and respect Zoe as a teacher and a mom.

Is there any way to ask Zoe to cut back on the TV (or stop it entirely) without damaging the relationship we have with her, which we know will continue for at least another year? She’s of course letting her own children watch TV with our daughter, which complicates the issue. On one hand I feel like we’re paying for her services, and we have a right to make a request, but on the other I feel like she’s doing a wonderful job overall, and is probably exhausted at the end of the day from her own kids, plus mine, and perhaps this falls into the “raising kids is a series of compromises” category. Most importantly, we feel like we’ve finally found child care we love at the center, and we really, really don’t want to screw that up in any way. Help??

—Don’t Want to Be a Screen Time Sanctimommy

Dear Not a Sanctimommy,

So, were it me, I would let it go, basically. You don’t actually know if it’s the screen time making your daughter more emotional and reactive; after all, she’s now negotiating spending the day with two other kids of very different ages, when she’s not used to having siblings, in a less-structured environment than day care. Summer kids are always a little different from school-year kids, as well.

It’s also just not that much TV. A full movie on a rainy day, a couple of half-hour TV shows before pickup? I think you could very nicely mention to Zoe that you’re trying to limit screen time and ask that it get capped at an hour per day (as mentioned, you are indeed paying her), but I think that Zoe sounds like a really good child care provider who is generally keeping a very respectable balance and getting the kids out and crafting and so on.

I’m leaving it up to you. I think it’s highly unlikely Zoe will be offended if you ask for a reasonable cap on screen time. An hour a day, as mentioned, is reasonable, whereas rainy days are their own creature, and I wouldn’t dream of complaining about an appropriate kid movie to get through one. I also think you could just let it go.

What I would say to Zoe is that it’s really hard to get your daughter to go home if the TV is on at the very end of the day, so you would appreciate it if the last hour of the day is made up of quieter activities. Best of luck!

Dear Care and Feeding,

I just recently found out I’m pregnant—hooray!—and am now navigating the information overload that comes with Googling anything to do with pregnancy and birth. I have many questions, but for now, I am having a hard time deciding on a care provider. I know I am interested in the midwifery model of care within a hospital setting, which narrows my options to 1) a midwifery group practice run out of a hospital across town, or 2) a midwife group/OB combo option that’s affiliated with my current primary care doctor’s office.

Option 1 is much farther away from home (45 minutes), so I’d have a significant commute for all my checkups and eventual delivery, but I know a lot of folks who’ve gone here and rave about the practice. Option 2 means I’d have all the checkups at my current doctor’s building literally two minutes from work and would deliver at a hospital only about 25 minutes from home, but I don’t know anyone who’s used the midwives there and don’t love the primary care practice it’s affiliated with—I’d actually been looking to switch PCPs anyway, though that ultimately has nothing to do with the OB-GYN part of the practice.

So I guess I’m weighing convenience vs. reputation? I did look up all the important maternity care stats for each hospital, and visited both, and they are about equal on every front as far as I can tell—the biggest difference is one allows water birth. I am leaning toward Option 1 based on the word of mouth, but am I going to hate schlepping across the city all the time or regret picking a delivery location so far away? I realize these are somewhat unanswerable questions at this early stage, but I’d appreciate advice about how care provider location can and should factor into this decision, the first of many to come for this new human!

—Call the Midwives!

Dear CtM,

Here’s the deal: Right now, you’re gonna be cruising into appointments very sporadically, but as you get bigger and bigger and grumpier and grumpier, they want to see you way more often. Every two weeks. Every week. Find yourself going overdue, you may be hauling your butt 45 minutes away and back every two days.

I’d stick with the two-minutes-away practice, especially considering their stats and outcomes are essentially equal. I think if you take my advice, you will be glad you did, come Week 38.

Congratulations, and good luck!

Dear Care and Feeding,

We live in a close-knit townhouse community, share a garage with our immediate neighbor, and generally get along and enjoy our neighbors. But I’ve had a growing issue with the way a 16-year-old neighbor interacts and seeks out my 5-year-old daughter.

You may indeed ruin the relationship you have with your neighbors.

At first it was asking about her school day type of small talk, but now he tries to tickle her every time he sees her, almost aggressively, and follows her until I wedge myself in between and say it’s time to go. I have had to tell him to move away from the car passenger door so I could get her out because he was standing so close, to stop tickling her when she was walking up stairs and eating. If he sees she is not with us, he generally responds, “Oh, she’s not with you? OK, have a nice day.” We have taught our daughter clear boundaries since she could talk and that any touch she doesn’t like is unwelcome and she should loudly say to stop.

But she loves all of our neighbors and the attention! I’m completely uncomfortable with the way he seems to stalk her when she is present. I’m at odds on how to respond without ruining the good relationship we have with the family otherwise. I’ve been subtle and asked him to stop when it was a safety concern, and asked her in front of him if she wanted to be tickled. How do I address this? I don’t think he is aware of how creepy and icky it appears. Do I talk to the kid and explain it isn’t appropriate for him to follow her and touch her without asking? Do I talk to his mom? She is super sweet and also loves my daughter, but at a more appropriate level.

Making it even more difficult to act: There may be a difference of cultures, as they are first-generation immigrants, and there have been communication barriers before. Also, the son appears to severely lack social skills (making me think he might be on the spectrum). I definitely need to address this before I act out of anger and scare the kid permanently and ruin our relationship with the neighbors.

—Super Uncomfortable

Dear Super Uncomfortable,

I don’t love this. I think it’s inappropriate, physical, and escalating. I think your best bet is to be even clearer, at a time your child is not present, and ideally when his mother is present. You should say that you do not want him to physically touch your child, ever, and that you’re fine with waving hello, but that he cannot hang out by your car or wait for her when he knows she’s coming home, because these are the boundaries you wish to have for your child.

I wish this was an easy conversation! You may indeed ruin the relationship you have with your neighbors. He may be neuroatypical; he may have no ill intentions whatsoever toward your child. But I don’t think she should ever be unattended outside your half of the townhouse (you know this already), and “You are not allowed to touch our daughter or follow her, it makes us uncomfortable and is inappropriate” is the sort of clarity that can really benefit someone who won’t pick up on the hints and nudges and body language that you have been trying so far.

I’m sorry. This sucks. As you clearly understand, it’s better to be uncomfortable than to let this situation continue to build.

18,My dog hates when my boyfriend and I kiss: pet advice from Beast Mode.,Nick Greene,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images Plus.

Beast Mode is Slate’s pet advice column. Have a question? Send it to beastmode@slate.com.

Dear Beast Mode,

I have a wonderful older Lab mix who is, in most situations, an absolute joy. She’s 13-ish now, and I adopted her when she was about 7. I was single back then, but I started dating a great guy about two years ago, and he’s recently moved in with me.

She was a rescue and was likely abandoned by a previous owner, so she’s always had separation anxiety, which is well controlled with medication.

But since the beau has been around, we’ve been dealing with another stress issue. Whenever her humans show physical affection for each other, she panics. She’ll pant heavily, whine, and eventually begin barking uncontrollably. She doesn’t do this if she’s around other friends who hold hands or kiss. It’s limited to us.

We’ve tried giving her Kongs or special treats to help calm her, but it doesn’t really help, and I’m afraid it may be reinforcing bad behavior. Any ideas for what we can try?

—Pooches Over Smooches

Dear Pooches Over Smooches,

PDA can be confusing for dogs. They aren’t good with acronyms, which is why they’ve never bothered to get together to figure out what “dog” stands for. (Defenders of the Globe? Dainty Obstinate Goofs? Dear Old Gremlins?) And then there’s the affection part. They show it differently than we do, so from your pooch’s vantage point, your boyfriend giving you a quick kiss in the hallway probably looks rather strange. I mean, you don’t even sniff his butt beforehand.

You might begin to associate intimacy with pungent doggie bites, and we wouldn’t want that, either.

Let’s stay with her perspective for a moment. Sure, the smooching and hugging might be alarming, but think about your co-habitation in general. For years, it was just you and her. She got accustomed to your schedule, embraced your scent, and learned when to expect food to “fall” from your fork during dinner. No matter what happened in the world, she knew she could count on all those things. Dogs like to live in the here and now (one of their best, most enviable qualities) and so she couldn’t have foreseen having to deal with a boyfriend. Now, she’s got this guy who showers at weird times and doesn’t smell like you do. He may even be so inconsiderate as to eat over the sink.

Given that your dog is already prescribed medication for anxiety, it would be wise to ask your vet about this new situation and whether it warrants an update or change. I imagine the veterinarian’s office is already a stressful place for the pooch, so take a video of how she behaves at home for evidence. If for some reason you feel uncomfortable showing your vet a video of you and your boyfriend kissing, simply point the camera at the dog.

You are extremely considerate to give her treats and toys, though it doesn’t sound like they’re working too well. Wait until she calms down to give her some primo goodies. Resist giving her rewards when she starts whining and barking, lest she start associating them with your strange, humanoid PDA. On the other hand, you might begin to associate intimacy with pungent doggie bites, and we wouldn’t want that, either. If you feel this Pavlovian response bubbling into your subconscious, please feel free to pull back a bit. We do a lot for our dogs, but they need to learn to live with us too.

This will take time. For now, act with your boyfriend as you would normally (whatever that happens to mean) and try to ignore your dog’s protestations. Don’t force anything, but keep the boyfriend armed with treats and encourage him to build a relationship with the dog. Once she’s more used to his presence, the sight of him giving you a kiss won’t be nearly as disturbing to her. With enough patience, she might even start to like him. After all, that’s what happened with you.","They show it differently than we do, so from your pooch’s vantage point, your boyfriend giving you a quick kiss in the hallway probably looks rather strange.

19,Charmin’s Massive “Forever Roll” Points the Way to a World of Products Right-Sized for Singles,Rachelle Hampton,"This absolute unit of toilet paper is the future. Charmin

Despite the fact that the oldest millennials are now approaching 40, it seems as if companies have only just begun learning how to market to them. From using models to casually co-opt protest imagery appealing to the socially conscious Youth to the chronic mis- and overuse of the slang term of the day (which is mostly a watering down of black vernacular, but that’s another story), the relationship between millennials and marketing has largely been one of misunderstanding on one side and mockery on the other. Enter: the Charmin Forever Roll. While the product technically launched back in April, it was brought to wider attention by a Wall Street Journal article examining the ways companies are adapting to the fact that more Americans are living alone than ever before.

Designed with those Americans in mind, the Forever Roll is a giant roll of toilet paper that purports to last up to one month. While that’s technically not forever, it is much longer than the average roll of toilet paper makes it and, most importantly, doesn’t require one to use up precious storage space on a 24-pack. The Forever Roll comes in a pack of three and even has its own starter kit, which includes a free-standing, brushed–stainless steel roll holder designed for its large size.

As the Cut’s Gabriella Paiella wrote, “As far as silly millennial-targeted marketing goes, this is pretty spot on—we live alone in small rentals because we can’t afford to buy real estate, we’re constantly working so we have limited time to run errands, and we LOVE using the bathroom.” Having three months of toilet paper on deck would solve a multitude of millennial ills, from errand paralysis to the phenomena of “outsourcing adulthood.” No need to Postmates toilet paper with the Forever Roll!

In fact, more industries should take a cue from Charmin’s absolute unit of toilet paper and roll out their own single-adult household version of products. One of the hardest parts of living alone, besides having to figure out how to humanely dispose of mice, is shopping for an appropriate amount of household staples. According to the Wall Street Journal piece, the market has responded to that in the food space by creating more single-serve items like pre-mixed salad kits or whatever a Jimmy Dean “Simple Scramble” is. But that solution is not only wasteful with packaging, it also skips right over the easier option: just scale everything down! At first glance, the Forever Roll seems to do the opposite; but by minimizing the amount of storage space one might need for three months’ worth of toilet paper, it performs a truly admirable duty of which more industries should take note.

The food industry should lead the pack. It is nigh impossible to cook for one without some sort of guilt-inducing food waste. To take a leaf out of the Forever Roll’s book, mainstream, normal-store brands should start offering half loaves of bread or single sprigs of fresh herbs, and the ability to buy three stalks of celery for that chicken soup recipe. Quality ground spices, which are not only expensive but start losing their flavor a lot sooner than most people realize, should come in half-sizes. Otherwise the single amateur chef is stuck with the option of seasoning their paprikash with dusty paprika or tossing out half-used containers every six months. (Yes, I realize I could always go to a specialty bulk spice store and get any amount of Hungarian paprika that I want or go to a bakery and get a half-loaf of bread, but that just tacks on more stops to a grocery-store run that I barely wanted to make in the first place. And while specialty stores are plentiful for me as a denizen of New York City, they aren’t necessarily convenient options for a lot of people who live outside of metropolitan areas.)

It’s not enough for brands to just offer a smaller size. They also need to end the tyranny of the bulk purchase, which makes buying things like laundry detergent and yes, toilet paper, much cheaper if you’re buying for a household. Sure, I can currently buy a small bottle of olive oil or salad dressing, but the price per ounce is much steeper than if I bought its larger cousins. To that end, I’m willing to lay the blame of Americans leading the world in food waste partially on the fact that it’s much cheaper to just buy more. Why get one banana for $0.50 when a whole bunch of them only costs $1.50? In our current market paradigm, more is quite literally less.

But the Forever Roll suggests a shifting tide, not toward new “innovations” that require more plastic packaging, but toward smartly portioned products that actually makes sense for the “party for one” more and more of us are throwing these days.","This absolute unit of toilet paper is the future.

20,Dear Prudence: My brother’s mother-in-law tried to set our mom on fire.,Daniel Mallory Ortberg,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Element5 Digital on Unsplash.

Dear Prudence,

My brother “John” married “Kim” last year. She is a perfectly nice woman, but we don’t have much in common and aren’t close. At the wedding, her mother got catastrophically drunk, sexually harassed the best man, and then got into a fight with the best man’s wife (a bridesmaid). The next morning, when the best man quietly moved tables so he wouldn’t have to sit with her, she screamed at him for “shaming” her and tried to stab him with a fork. No one on the bride’s side blinked an eye. The rest of us assumed they were just trying to salvage the rest of the day by keeping the peace, but when my brother asked Kim about it later, she said the best man shouldn’t have “flirted” with her mom and then “acted coy” afterward just because his wife found out. That’s … not what happened. We all saw her mother get out of control in front of everyone.

John said to let it go because weddings can get emotional. But then the same thing sort of happened at Christmas when Kim invited us all to their house for a party. This time, her mother tried to set fire to my mother’s dress, supposedly for flirting with her boyfriend. Kim said that it was my mother’s fault for being too friendly and that her mother had been cheated on a lot. John said that Kim knew her mother was in the wrong but was just really defensive of her. Now Kim has invited everyone to a birthday barbecue for my brother next month. We don’t want to go, but we also don’t want to skip my brother’s party. Every family has a difficult member (we have an uncle who gets drunk and angry if you won’t let him drive), but Kim’s mother actually tries to hurt people, both drunk and sober. How can we handle this? Not go? Go and do something if Kim’s mother gets upset again? (I wanted to call the police at Christmas, but Mom is worried that will alienate Kim and John. His best friend, the best man at the wedding, has already stopped talking to him because of the wedding day incident, which actually probably could have qualified as sexual assault if he’d wanted to push it, never mind his wife’s black eye.)

—Family Freakout

You are, as a family, significantly underreacting to Kim’s mom and the people who enable her. (You may also be underreacting to this uncle who gets belligerent when his relatives prevent him from drinking and driving, but we’ll focus on Kim’s mom for now.) This woman tried to set your mother on fire for talking to a man. She sexually assaulted a man she barely knew while he was serving as the groom’s best man at her daughter’s wedding. Say the following sentence out loud to yourself: “I’m thinking about going to a barbecue with a woman who tried to set my mother on fire for talking to a man.” Does that sound like a reasonable sentence? Would you feel comfortable saying it in front of other people who aren’t already weirdly bound up with this woman’s bizarre, violent antics? I’m having visions of Kim’s mom trying to throw one of your relatives on the barbecue over some perceived slight while Kim and John try to stop everyone from calling an ambulance: “Look, I know things got a little out of hand today, but you have to admit that my mother had a right to the last corn muffin.” She’s not a little bit rude or a touch difficult. She is dangerous and surrounded by people who treat her acts of wild, unpredictable violence as interesting acts of whimsy.

Do not go to this barbecue. If your brother asks why, tell him that you are not willing to put yourself in the same room as a woman who has a history of assaulting your family members and that it is unreasonable for him to expect you to. If he tries to make you feel like you’re the unreasonable one, then let him continue living on whatever fantasy island he’s currently marooned on. But don’t go join him there. If he wants to meet you for dinner in a restaurant without his mother-in-law, great. If he wants to come by your place sometime for a drink after work, fantastic. But spending time with Kim’s mom is a non-starter.

Dear Prudence,

My 19-year-old daughter died in a car accident two years ago. It splintered the few, frayed bonds holding my marriage together. My ex and I still have an 11-year-old son with special needs. I depend on my in-laws for assistance and see them often. My ex’s niece is pregnant with a girl, and her due date falls on my daughter’s birthday. They want to “honor” my daughter by bestowing her name on the baby. My ex is happy about this and cried when they asked him. When they asked me if it would be OK, I froze. My daughter was close to her cousin, and I know this comes from a place of love and loss, but the idea of hearing my daughter’s name over and over kills me. I don’t know what to do now that I have given my blessing. Everyone in the family is happy about this and sees the baby as an extension of the life my daughter never got to have. I am just reminded she isn’t here anymore. I feel sick. What do I do? What do I say?

—Namesake

It sounds like you’re closer to your in-laws than your ex at this point, so I’d suggest asking them to talk to your ex’s niece on your behalf. Please don’t feel like because you froze on the spot when they first asked you about it that you’re now honor-bound to go along with it. It makes sense that you’d need time to think it over. Tell them that you appreciate the kindness of your niece’s gesture and that you know it’s intended as an act of love and connection, but as you’ve thought about it, the idea of hearing your daughter’s name spoken every day would be a very painful reminder of your loss, and you hope they will be able to ask your ex’s niece to reconsider. You could ask if she’s willing to use it as a middle name, so there’s still acknowledgement of their relationship but it doesn’t put you in regular contact with your daughter’s name.

Dear Prudence,

I grew up in an Episcopalian family. My grandfather was a priest, my gran was an organist, my dad is a deacon, and the rest of the family sang in the choir. When I was 14, I became interested in exploring religion and theology. My dad was OK with that until I brought home a book on Wicca. He threatened to burn it if I didn’t return it immediately. I’m 33 now and pagan. I’ve been in the broom closet with my dad for years. It doesn’t bother me—except that I’m getting married next year in a pagan ceremony and I want him there. We are not asking him to be financially responsible or to participate in any way. We just want him to be there and support us as we say our vows. How do I tell my super-unsupportive dad that I’m pagan without alienating him or destroying our relationship?

—Pagan Wedding

I wish I had a script for that! You can tell him gently and try to offer in broad strokes what you get out of paganism; what it means to you; and how it helps you live the kind of life you consider good, useful, and compassionate. But if he’s determined to be alienated by the very idea of paganism, there’s probably no way you can phrase it that will avoid at least some conflict. That leaves you with a few options: First, and possibly easiest, you could tell him about your wedding after the ceremony and say you eloped, leaving the details of the ceremony purposely vague and maintaining the sort-of-secret of your spirituality indefinitely. This has the obvious downside of not getting to have your father at your wedding, and your dad could learn the details and get upset regardless. But if you’re OK maintaining an otherwise close relationship that accepts certain limitations on your father’s part as a precondition of said closeness, that’s probably your easiest, safest choice (though I wouldn’t advise this if, say, you’ve got a number of cousins attending).

If you can’t see yourself going that route, I think it’s better to talk with him now, while you’re still a year out from the wedding and potentially have time to go through a brief estrangement or extended conflict before the big day. And when it comes to giving unsupportive parents news you know they won’t respond to with joy, it’s best to be straightforward, offer a brief sketch of your own perspective and why you’re introducing the topic now, and give them the opportunity to ask some questions: “I want to invite you to my wedding next year, and I want to tell you something about it now. It’s going to be a pagan ceremony, in keeping with our beliefs, which means that there’ll be [briefly outline what will distinguish your ceremony from a traditional one]. I’ve been reluctant to bring up my beliefs again, because I love you and I don’t want this to come between us. But I think it’s time you knew this about me, and what it means to me, and if you ever want to learn a little bit more about why I’m a pagan or what my spiritual practices mean to me, I would love to answer any questions you may have. I really hope you can be there.” Beyond that, I’d advise you to stay calm, anticipate that his first response may not be his best or last response, and hope for the best.

Dear Prudence,

Four years ago, my grandpa shot and killed himself. I still get really emotional thinking about it, and I’m haunted by intrusive thoughts about how and why. I’ve contemplated a support group, but I don’t know if I’d fit in. My grandpa was 89 and had lived a full life—married 70 years; served in the Army; traveled; had a successful career; and saw his kids, grandkids, and even some great-grandkids come into the world. But he had been in failing health for some time. He was in pain and was losing his independence; he’d been in and out of hospitals, nursing homes, and emergency rooms before finally coming home. He was proud and stubborn (qualities we shared), and I believe he dreaded becoming dependent on anyone ever again. It’s not the fact that he died—I’d long expected it—but the way that he died that feels traumatic. My grandmother found his body, and there was no note and no goodbye. We were close, and I had plans to visit just three days after he died.

With the exception of my relationship with my grandmother, whom I don’t want to burden with my grief, my other family relationships are fairly superficial. My friends can’t quite relate. Therapy is a last resort (financial reasons as well as a previous bad experience that has just turned me off). I think a support group might make sense for me, but I would feel guilty lamenting over the loss of my 89-year-old grandpa alongside people who may have lost kids, siblings, spouses, etc. I view my grandpa’s death a little differently. His life wasn’t tragically cut short, and I can’t say that we didn’t have enough years together. Honestly, I wish he’d lived in a state with legal options for terminally ill adults to end their own lives (I mention this only for context—I’d never bring it up in a support group setting). Yes, I know my grief is legitimate. And I know that if he’d died of natural causes, I wouldn’t still be so emotional after four years. But I also know that my grief is just different from a mother who lost a child, for example. Would my presence and grieving offend or elicit eye-rolls from someone mourning someone who was younger and/or not terminally ill? I want to be respectful and sensitive. What do you think?

—Grieving for Grandpa

I think looking for a support group specifically for people who have lost loved ones to suicide will be the best move for you. Suicide Awareness Voices of Education has a running list of various suicide support groups nationwide, and going to a group that’s not just for the broad umbrella of “anyone who’s grieving” may go a long way toward making you feel like you belong there. (You have every right to go to a general grief support group, but it may put your mind at ease before you walk in the door.) You seem very aware of the ways in which the traumatic loss of your grandfather is not the same as the traumatic loss of a partner or a child, and I think other people will be able to identify that difference too. I don’t think you’ll confuse or upset anyone by wanting to talk about your own loss, and they’ll be able to share your sense of scale. Part of the labor of grieving together involves saying, “Your loss is not the same as mine, but there are ways we can mourn together and help one another, and it doesn’t require sameness or conformity of experience in order to work.” I hope you’re able to find a group near you, go, make meaningful connections there, and know that you’ve earned your spot in the circle.

Dear Prudence Uncensored

“Kim is the operator in the Titanic saying, ‘Yeah we hit an iceberg but it’s fine, go back to sleep.’ ”

Daniel Mallory Ortberg and Nicole Cliffe discuss this letter in this week’s Dear Prudence Uncensored—only for Slate Plus members.

Dear Prudence,

I attend a large university and am going into my third year. I love my school and have made really wonderful and supportive friends. However, I would love to find a romantic partner. I’m a straight woman, and I’ve been on a few dating apps and gone on many dates in the past couple of years, often with plenty of mutual interest, but my chronic illness and service dog make things complicated. He goes everywhere with me in order to detect if my medical condition is becoming dangerous and I need to take action. He makes me feel safe, is extremely well-behaved, and unless I’m in need of medical attention or we’re out walking, no one usually notices him.

I try to be up-front about my service dog, but I usually don’t bring him with me on first dates out of fear. My siblings sometimes feel uncomfortable with the dog and say that I’m “attracting too much attention,” so I fear that men I want to date will feel the same way. I usually mention my dog on first dates, and it’s almost never well-received. Sometimes guys say they’re allergic, which is legitimate, but sometimes they say they aren’t comfortable or that they’re not looking for a relationship with someone who needs a service dog. Some just say, “Oh … ” Others start asking a lot of intrusive questions about my medical condition and express reservations about dating someone with “constraints.” I don’t want to date an asshole who secretly hates my service dog and resents me for my chronic illness, but I’m tired of being completely shut down just because I have different physical needs than they do. How can I find people who don’t feel intimidated or weirded out by my service dog? Is there a way to bring it up that won’t make people jump into panic mode? Is there a way that I can respond to people who do express concern about my service dog and dating to make the situation more comfortable?

—Suddenly Dog-Shy

I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with this same roadblock on so many first dates. It sounds absolutely exhausting. I’m sorry, too, that your siblings have made you feel like a quiet, well-behaved dog that helps you monitor your medical condition is drawing unnecessary attention, as if you were doing something bizarre or socially inappropriate. It sounds like this problem exists mostly in their own heads and that most people in public don’t give your dog a second thought. I hope you can remind yourself to dismiss their concerns as having nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.

When it comes to the guys you’re seeing, I’d recommend trying a few things. First, I’d consider trying one or two dating apps or sites that specifically serve people with chronic illnesses. Not because you ought to restrict your dating pool—certainly keep using the apps you’re already on—but because it might feel energizing and exciting to occasionally go out with someone who also has a service dog or at least has a deeper understanding about why a person might need one. Second, let these guys know beforehand, either in your dating profile or in the conversation arranging the time and place of your first date, that you have a service dog that monitors your medical condition. If they demur, disappear, or start to ask overly personal questions (rather than a friendly question like, “Is there anything I should know about him? Should I acknowledge him, or is it better to leave him alone when he’s working?”), then at least you haven’t wasted an evening. And if you occasionally need to give yourself a break from dating because you find it’s wearing down your self-esteem and emotional resilience, please do. Take a few weeks or months off, focus on the people and the things in your life that give you joy, and only reenter the dating pool when you’re feeling ready.

Dear Prudence,

I am a white cis woman who enjoys being very feminine, and I am in a heterosexual relationship. I was in this relationship a year ago when I admitted to my boyfriend, and myself, that I had a crush on a female co-worker and I am bisexual. I’m now out to my friends and family, who have all been supportive, my mom’s “But are you sure?” notwithstanding.

The last time I went to a Pride parade was around 10 years ago, I was in middle school, and I was wearing a Straight Advocates for Equality shirt. Now Pride Month is rolling around again, and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Do I go to a Pride event with my straight boyfriend? Do I go alone? I just moved to a new town a little over a year ago and don’t really have friends whom I could ask to go with me. And most of all, I don’t know if I would be welcome or enjoy being there, or if I would feel like I don’t belong. Am I wrong that Pride isn’t meant for people like me?

—Is Pride for Me?

I’ve noticed an uptick in this “Should I, who used to think of myself as straight and came to understand myself as bisexual while in an opposite-sex relationship, consider myself welcome at Pride?” conversation over the past few years, but it’s almost entirely taken place online. That’s not to say versions of it don’t happen in person, but if you simply go to Pride, you are not likely to run into anyone saying either you can or can’t be there. Also, more importantly, there is no person or group of people who have the authority to ban you from Pride events.

As for whether you would enjoy being there or feel like you belong, I cannot guess. You may go and make friends; you may go and feel isolated. There are a number of ways to feel alone in a crowd, as well as a number of ways to establish meaningful-if-fleeting connections with strangers in public. You’ll only know if you go. In the long run, it’s important to ask what kinds of communities you want to be a part of; how and in what ways you might ask for your boyfriend’s support in acknowledging, affirming, or exploring your bisexuality; what kinds of relationships and connections you want to prioritize; and how you might invest in your local queer scene in such a way that next Pride you have a group of friends you want to go with. Does your city have Pride events beyond the parade? Many do, and many have additional events or stages or parades specifically for women or bisexual people. Mostly, I’d urge you to think of Pride as the beginning, rather than the end-all and be-all of your bisexual life in this new city. If you pin all your hopes of finding friendship and feeling immediately at ease in your identity on a two-hour parade on a Sunday in June either by yourself or with only your boyfriend for company, that’s too much pressure. Good luck!

Classic Prudie

I’m a divorced mother of three college kids. While I was raising them alone, I had no time or money for vacations, home improvements, dates, or my own education. But with them all in college, I returned to school to get my degree and reconnected with my high school sweetheart. I’m in love like never before. He lives out of state but will be moving in with me soon. I want time to bond with him without having the kids around. My house is small and having three young adults around will mean no privacy. Two of my kids have apartments at college, and one son with Asperger’s is home taking a semester off. Their father lives nearby but was neglectful and is a selfish jerk with a personality disorder and a second wife and kids. I told my children in January that my fiancé would be moving in, and my daughter said she planned to go to summer school and stay in her college apartment. My other son said he had a job and apartment lined up. Now my daughter’s decided she’d rather come home, and my son wants to come on weekends because his job is in a boring town. I’m considering barring them from returning home and telling them to just suck it up and grow up. Will it cause permanent damage to our relationship if I tell them to stay with their father or only come one weekend a month? I’ve worked as a secretary and also cared for my elderly mother. Isn’t it my time to be happy?","This time, her mother tried to set fire to my mother’s dress, supposedly for flirting with her boyfriend.
I don’t know what to do now that I have given my blessing.
I’ve contemplated a support group, but I don’t know if I’d fit in.
How can I find people who don’t feel intimidated or weirded out by my service dog?
Now Pride Month is rolling around again, and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.","['tried', 'motherinlaw', 'know', 'youre', 'pride', 'mom', 'mother', 'im', 'brothers', 'dont', 'dog', 'say', 'prudence', 'feel', 'best', 'set', 'dear']",2019-06-06 10:00:04.140000+00:00,https://slate.com

Danny: saints tortured by the fire and the rack and by Kim’s mom

“sexually assault the best man and physically assault his wife once, shame on you”

Nicole: What the HELL

Danny: “set my mother on fire twice, shame on me”

come on!!!

SHE TRIED TO SET YOUR MOTHER ON FIRE

Nicole: I WOULD CARRY BEAR SPRAY

also no, do not go to this BBQ

Danny: Kim is not a “nice lady you don’t have much in common with”

Kim watched her mom try to ARSON YOUR MOTHER

Nicole: why on EARTH

KIM IS PART OF THE PROBLEM

Danny: and her response was “well, some guys you don’t know cheated on her”

Kim is the operator in the Titanic saying “yeah we hit an iceberg but it’s fine, go back to sleep”

“Mom is worried this will alienate Kim and John”

i hope it does!!!

i’m just picturing your mom getting thrown into the barbecue at this party and telling you

“don’t say anything, John might get offended”

Nicole: MUSTN’T OFFEND JOHN

This wild woman is probably building a Wicker Man for someone at the BBQ

Danny: yeah you don’t go

you never go to any event Kim’s mom is at

Nicole: Nope

Not ever

Danny: that’s done, we’re done with that

Nicole: (dusts off hands)

Danny: and if Kim or John try to act like you’re being unreasonable

you get to say “I’m not comfortable being around a woman who tried to set my mom on fire and sexually assaulted your best friend”

which is a GIFT of a sentence

Nicole: Such a gift

I WOULD LOVE to deliver that sentence

Danny: poll 1000 people and you’re going to get 1000 notes of agreement “Yes, that’s a reasonable sentence”

you’ll win Family Feud with that sentence

Nicole: Kim and her family are deeply deeply committed to normalizing their mom’s behavior

Danny: this is a woman who would absolutely try to poison you if she thought you were slighting her alma mater or something

Nicole: You will not cut through those decades of enabling

Danny: and you guys have been sucked into that storm and it’s starting to infect your brains

Nicole: also Kim is bad

Danny: Kim is SO BAD.

this isn’t like “her mom is a little difficult and i need a script for dealing with her when she gets heated”

this is

she tried to set your mom and fire!!

and your mom is worried about offending John!!!

Nicole: ON FIRE

yeah, John is going to be offended and you can just be warm and calm and honest when he comes to you about it

He’s so new, I hope you can pull John out of this nest of utter wild-as-heck people

Danny: John needs to be offended! He threw his best friend to the side after his new mother-in-law sexually assaulted him and tried to stab him in public!

your brother John is officially a bad person

he needs to do a big about-face if he wants to move back to clear conscience island

Nicole: TRIED TO STAB HIM WITH A FORK

Danny: IN PUBLIC

and apparently gave his wife a black eye

this dame is not letting the grass grow under her feet, violence-wise

read up on the missing stair, reconsider that you may also be underreacting to your uncle who loves drunk driving (which can DEFINITELY hurt people), get into a fight with your brother and Kim and hold your ground, maybe drop in on a peer support group for codependent family dynamics

Nicole: HMMMMMMMMM

not a bad plan

Danny: practice saying “I don’t spend time with people who try to set my mother on fire” in front of a mirror until you feel comfortable saying it to other people","This week: violent mother-in-law.

Danny: saints tortured by the fire and the rack and by Kim’s mom

“sexually assault the best man and physically assault his wife once, shame on you”

Nicole: What the HELL

Danny: “set my mother on fire twice, shame on me”

SHE TRIED TO SET YOUR MOTHER ON FIRE

Nicole: I WOULD CARRY BEAR SPRAY

Kim watched her mom try to ARSON YOUR MOTHER

Nicole: why on EARTH

KIM IS PART OF THE PROBLEM

Danny: and her response was “well, some guys you don’t know cheated on her”

Kim is the operator in the Titanic saying “yeah we hit an iceberg but it’s fine, go back to sleep”

“Mom is worried this will alienate Kim and John”

i hope it does!!!

i’m just picturing your mom getting thrown into the barbecue at this party and telling you

“don’t say anything, John might get offended”

This wild woman is probably building a Wicker Man for someone at the BBQ

Danny: yeah you don’t go

you never go to any event Kim’s mom is at

Nicole: Nope

Not ever

Danny: that’s done, we’re done with that

Nicole: (dusts off hands)

Danny: and if Kim or John try to act like you’re being unreasonable

you get to say “I’m not comfortable being around a woman who tried to set my mom on fire and sexually assaulted your best friend”

which is a GIFT of a sentence

Nicole: Such a gift

I WOULD LOVE to deliver that sentence

Danny: poll 1000 people and you’re going to get 1000 notes of agreement “Yes, that’s a reasonable sentence”

you’ll win Family Feud with that sentence

Nicole: Kim and her family are deeply deeply committed to normalizing their mom’s behavior

Danny: this is a woman who would absolutely try to poison you if she thought you were slighting her alma mater or something

Nicole: You will not cut through those decades of enabling

Danny: and you guys have been sucked into that storm and it’s starting to infect your brains

Nicole: also Kim is bad

Danny: Kim is SO BAD.

this isn’t like “her mom is a little difficult and i need a script for dealing with her when she gets heated”

this is

she tried to set your mom and fire!!

and your mom is worried about offending John!!!

Nicole: ON FIRE

yeah, John is going to be offended and you can just be warm and calm and honest when he comes to you about it

31,Help! I Refuse to Date Single Moms. Does That Make Me a Shallow Jerk?,Daniel Mallory Ortberg,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Hannah Busing on Unsplash and michaeljung/iStock/Getty Images Plus.

Every week, Daniel Mallory Ortberg answers additional questions from readers, just for Slate Plus members.

Q. Matchmaking: A recent career shift and a divorce have me moving back to my home city where both my sisters live. My divorce was amicable; we realized we married too young and were too different. I still talk to her. My sisters keep trying to set me up with friends. I wouldn’t mind this, except all the women are single mothers. I am looking for a serious relationship, but I have no desire to play Papa or have a part-time partner. I have never been a kid person, no matter how much I love my nephews. I had a vasectomy years ago because my ex and I agreed to no kids.

I guess I put my foot in my mouth, and my older sister, who is a divorced single mom, got very upset with me. She called me shallow, stupid, and “exactly what was wrong with the American male.” My other sister told me she was disappointed in me. I am pretty annoyed—I don’t think my dating criteria is any worse than an atheist not wanting to date someone deeply religious. It is not about judgment, just incompatible lifestyles. It isn’t like I am fetishizing another race or going after barely legal coeds. I just want an attractive, single woman whom I can enjoy my life with. What do I say to my sisters?

A: “I love you both so much, and it’s been really kind of you to try to set me up on dates. But it’s clearly not working out. I don’t want children, and I’d rather be single than date someone else with children when I know I can’t be a co-parent in the long run. I think you know how much I love my nephews, what great mothers I think you both are, and how happy I am to spend time with the kids as an uncle and a babysitter—I certainly hope you know that, because it’s true. But I also hope you can respect my decision not to be a parent myself and know that it’s not a reflection on your identities as parents—nor does it make me shallow or stupid just because I know my own mind and what I’m looking for in a relationship. From now on, I’ll look for my own dates.”","Q. Matchmaking: A recent career shift and a divorce have me moving back to my home city where both my sisters live.

Prudence is joined this week by Julian K. Jarboe, a writer and sound designer from Massachusetts. Their debut collection, Everyone on the Moon is Essential Personnel, is forthcoming next spring.

Together, they tackle letters about what to do when you’re suddenly responsible for a young niece and nephew who are practically strangers, whether you should propose to your boyfriend while also living in an intensely traumatic environment, how to handle a husband who believes masturbation is an act akin to infidelity, what actions to take when you discover the mom at your kid’s play date house is always screaming at her own kids, what to do if you have suicidal feelings that you don’t want to share with your therapist, and what to do when you can’t yet legally change your name and you get upset when people use it.

Slate Plus members will hear Prudie and Jarboe discuss a letter writer who’s wondering what to do when, as an executor of a will, you discover your relative had an enormous pornography collection.

33,Help! There’s Too Much Racism in My Parents’ Facebook Feeds. Can I Be Their Secret Censor?,Daniel Mallory Ortberg,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by NordWood Themes on Unsplash.

Daniel Mallory Ortberg is online weekly to chat live with readers. Here’s an edited transcript of this week’s chat.

Q. Parents’ problematic Facebook groups: My parents recently got invited to a neighborhood Facebook group that, alongside garage sales, traffics heavily in racist fake news concerning real and imagined crimes by “African youths.” Challenging them on facts doesn’t work. (“Why would someone post it if it wasn’t true?”) Would it be wrong of me to sneakily grab their phone and unfollow the worst offenders? They are pretty hopeless with technology, so they won’t notice, but the world would be a better place if their news feed reverted to baby photos and cat videos.

A: You are not violating your parents’ rights to constantly absorb racist videos on Facebook; go ahead and unsubscribe them with my blessing, and keep challenging their racism whenever they bring it up, even if you don’t make immediate headway.

Q. Gambling: I finally cut off contact with my younger brother. He is a gambling addict. He can blow thousands of dollars in a single weekend and still beg for more money because he is “owed” a winning streak. He will not admit he has a problem. It has been a problem for years, and I finally reached my limit. He called me up begging for money. His girlfriend’s kid was very sick, and they both were in between paychecks. I could hear the kid coughing in the background, so I relented and sent him over $200 via an app. The idiot took and then posted pictures of himself at the casino less than two hours later. The kid wasn’t even sick; I called my brother’s girlfriend, and she had no clue what I was talking about. I called my brother and left a message that I hope he won big because it had cost him a brother. I blocked him on social media and my phone.

I was talking about it later with some friends when one of the girls chirped that I needed to be “more compassionate” to my brother, since gambling addiction was a disease and he was “sick.” And I wasn’t “allowed” to be mad at my brother because when you give people money, it is theirs to do with as they wish. My jaw dropped. I asked her if she thought it was OK for drug addicts to rob people and if she would be OK if I went into her purse and took money out of her wallet. She turned red and said no. Then I said, did she think it was compassionate to treat a stranger better than your own brother? It got heated, and someone else stepped in, but I seethed the entire night. Now I have friends telling me I need to apologize to this girl because I made her “feel bad.” I just lost my brother, but her feeling bad matters more. I barely know this girl, and she decided to open her mouth and lecture me. I know I am not in the best place emotionally, but that is a really shitty thing to do, right? I don’t want to apologize, but I don’t know if my instincts are the best here. I need outside perspective. I loved my brother, I tried my best since our parents died, but there is nothing left in me anymore. He’s taken it all and gambled it away.

A: It’s possible that at some point during this argument, the best thing you could have said was “I don’t think we’re going to agree about this, and I’m not comfortable arguing about my private relationship with my brother anymore. Let’s talk about something else.” But you were under some pretty serious provocation, and this girl who barely knows you was wildly out of line to try to tell you how to feel about your own brother (not to mention the fact that she implied “having compassion” for him meant you’re not allowed to set limits or acknowledge the ways in which his gambling addiction has hurt you). If you think you lost your temper, you might consider saying something to your friend like, “I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable that night I got into an argument with ____. I should have realized the conversation wasn’t going anywhere productive sooner and stopped it before it started to dominate everybody’s night. But I’m not sorry I disagreed with her, and I still think she was out of line to tell me I don’t have compassion for my brother. Part of the reason I was telling my friends about our estrangement is because I feel sad, angry, and overwhelmed at the fact that I don’t really have a relationship with my brother anymore, that he’s repeatedly demonstrated he just wants money from me and nothing else. I’m looking for a little compassion myself.”

Q. Re: Parents’ problematic Facebook groups: OMFG, do not modify your parents’ Facebook settings without their consent or knowledge. Would you like it if they did the same to you?

A: Yeah, I don’t really go for using the language of autonomy about something like the right to look at racist videos about imaginary crimes committed by nonexistent black people when you log into Facebook. I think it’s fine to be a little benevolently paternalistic in this case.

Q. Reluctant quitter: My husband, “Michael,” and I were married two years ago at the age of 34. We are both in relatively good health, though my general practitioner has reminded me repeatedly that any pregnancy at this point would be a geriatric pregnancy (requested an AARP card for my uterus, she was not amused). One of the things she recommended to me was to quit smoking before we even try to get pregnant. But how can I, when smoking is what gets me through life?

I am the most junior analyst at a job where the team lead has been known to make people quit, cry, and break out into random cursing fits. You can take as many smoke breaks as you need, if work is caught up, so I smoke to get away from her. My husband’s band is touring the best dive bars in the Southeast? Then it’s a smoke with a beer. Want to cry but too emotionally constipated? Have a smoke. Dealing with my occasionally bigoted in-laws (and low-key Southern racism in general) when I’m reminded that two people of separate races are “unequally yoked”? Smoke. Drive past where my veteran best friend killed himself? Smoke three back to back.

The longest I have quit for is three months. And to be honest, I hated every wretched minute of it. I’ve tried pills, patches, gum, herbal cigarettes, diet, exercise, water, hypnotism, and vaping. Nothing replaces the awesomeness of having a habit that, for the most part, doesn’t encourage people to follow you when you walk off. Michael, who quit smoking cold turkey years ago, thinks that I am just putting it off because I hate procreation. How do I explain that smoking is what keeps me from burning down my job, cussing out his family, or breaking down and crying when life gets to be too much? Why deal with feelings when I can compartmentalize them by the time I have finished my cigarette?

A: I relate profoundly to this! Whenever I’ve quit smoking, after the quitting flu dissipates, my brain immediately starts saying: “Great, OK, we’ve quit for a week. We did it! Whatever quitting is, we did it. Now when do we start smoking again?” Not smoking has only felt bearable if I’ve been able to think of the day when I’ll start smoking again. Part of the joy of a physical addiction is structuring your day around an absolutely undeniable need: I have to get this much ______ or else I’ll get sick. And for someone who’s in the habit of minimizing a lot of their other needs (like the need for a job that doesn’t make you feel like you’re going to have a nervous breakdown every hour, or for an honest, reliable relationship with your partner where you’re not worried they’re about to run off on a dive bar tour and leave you holding the Responsibility Bag, or the need to live free from racist harassment), it can come to feel necessary to being able to function. “As long as I can have this one thing that’s wholly mine, wholly private, wholly uninterrupted, and combines a sense of physical relief with a self-destructive impulse, I can deal with the rest of my totally unsustainable life.”

That’s not to say, by the way, that if you were to quit your job and find a better one, or if you had some difficult conversations with your partner about what you need from one another, or if you cut your in-laws out of your life, that you’d suddenly be free of the urge to smoke. Smoking is still physically addictive no matter how smoothly your life is running. But I do think you’ve correctly identified what smoking is doing for you, in addition to calming down the I-need-nicotine part of your brain, when you say “Why deal with feelings when I can compartmentalize them by the time I have finished my cigarette?” It’s worked for you, right up until it’s stopped working for you. Now that you’ve run up against something like the plan to get pregnant that exposes the weak spots in your coping strategy, it’s become clear that you need more than what just smoking can give you. Like a partner who doesn’t ask you to spend time with his racist family so they can tell you that your relationship is “unequal,” for example, or a job that offers more in the way of work-life balance than just “smoke when you’re about to pass out, then get back to work.” I hope you do continue to try to quit smoking, because I want you to live a long and healthy life, but I also think the idea of getting pregnant is making it clear how little support you have in your life right now, and how much more you need. Not just for the sake of a potential child if you do get pregnant, but for your sake.

Q. My parents won’t let my adult partner stay in my room: My parents are deeply conservative—if occasionally hypocritical—Southern Baptists. My partner of four years and I make the hourlong drive nearly every weekend to visit them, my siblings, my grandparents, and my partner’s parents, but normally we stay with my family. They want us to visit and beg us to see them when we don’t (and we really enjoy seeing them!). But recently they’ve begun to make a big deal out of us sleeping in the same room. There are other places to sleep in the house, but they’re incredibly uncomfortable, and at this point it seems silly since we share an apartment and we’ve already been sharing a bed at my parents’ house until now. We aren’t married and do not intend to get married, but we have made a long-term commitment to one another. If it were just occasional visits, I wouldn’t worry about it, and it would be petty to threaten not to come visit over this. But their proposed sleeping arrangements are just so uncomfortable. I can’t afford to rent a hotel every other weekend, or I would go that route. Is this a battle worth fighting?

A: I certainly think anything that affects most of your weekends in a given year is worth addressing directly! I wonder if the first and best opportunity for doing so is not revisiting the who-sleeps-where policy but revisiting the “spending almost every weekend at my parents’ house.” I get that you’re close and generally enjoy seeing them, but that’s an awful lot of visits! Might you and your partner not enjoy setting aside, say, one or two weekends a month for spending time with your friends or relaxing at home? You might find that it makes your return visits a little less fraught when they don’t come every five to seven days.

That said, you still have to figure out what to do when you are there, and I want to help you find a balance between honoring your parents’ wishes (even when they don’t dovetail with your own priorities, and even when those wishes are slightly inconsistent with the sleeping arrangements of the past) and establishing yourself as an adult in a long-term, committed relationship. I think it’s best to approach them before your next visit and say this: “Mom and Dad, I’ve noticed you’ve gotten more uncomfortable recently with our sharing a room when we visit. For the past few years we’ve shared a room and it’s seemed fine, but if something’s changed for you and you want to revisit the conversation, we can. As you know, we live together and don’t plan on getting married to signify our commitment, so this isn’t something that’s going to go away anytime soon. Do you have any thoughts?” I don’t think it’s “threatening” to say that a room-sharing change would probably mean you visit a little less often; it’s not just a question of sex but of the legitimacy of your relationship, and being asked to split up every weekend is a pretty big request for them to make of you. It’s more a matter of cause and effect. If they can ultimately decide that, while they wish you’d get married, they can respect your choice not to, that’s great. If they can’t, and they want to request that every visit you two sleep apart and lose out on the little domestic habits that make up a pretty significant part of living together, then it stands to reason that you will visit a little less often, or at least end up driving home rather than spending the night.

Q. Do I have a stalker? I need help sorting through the mess I’ve made and protecting myself. I’m ashamed to say that I had a yearlong affair with a coworker “Bob.” We are both married and justified the affair with lame excuses about our marriages. I was severely depressed and enjoyed the attention and thrill. He is a habitual cheater and creates a lot of drama, so it was a vicious cycle of ups and downs and me trying to walk away several times but getting pulled back in. I finally cut it off six months ago: I quit my job, got myself on medication, and started exercising, eating better, and really focusing on my marriage and my well-being. Neither of our spouses knows.

My birthday was two months ago, and he sent me a gift, even though we hadn’t had any contact in four months. It wasn’t smart on my part, but I sent him an email to say thank you. He responded and I realized I didn’t want to get sucked in again, so I blocked his email. Just recently, I sold one of the gifts he’d given me during the affair. It was an antique item ($100 value). I sold it very cheaply (among other things I was purging from our house) on my husband’s old eBay account. My husband hadn’t used this account in quite some time. Out of the blue, I got a very angry text from Bob demanding to know how I could have sold the gift. It really startled and scared me. How did he even know I sold it? And he confronted me like I had done something wrong and hurt him. I didn’t respond and blocked his number on my phone so I don’t get any more texts, but I’m freaked out over this. I don’t know if I should worry or not about this behavior. I don’t know if I should hide anything online; my name isn’t on the account, it’s my husband’s very old email address, the item was sold to some random person across the country, and I have no idea how he tracked it. I’m feeling paranoid, uneasy, guilty that I got myself involved with this guy, and unsure of what I should be doing. Please help me get some perspective!

A: I worry you might not like this perspective, but I think you need to talk to your husband about this. The two of you were involved for a year, you used to work together, he’s keeping tabs on at least one account associated with your husband, and you’re currently a ball of anxiety and panic about whether you’re going to hear from Bob again. I think the mental and emotional energy of trying to hide a pretty significant affair from your husband for presumably the rest of your marriage is going to take a toll you can’t afford to pay. Imagine how much worse it will feel if your husband finds out because Bob gets in touch with him, or if he senses that you’ve been distant and preoccupied and finds some sort of evidence you didn’t remember to scrub. Keeping this from your husband is just too exhausting, especially when you know your ex–affair partner is angry and potentially trying to find other ways to get in touch with you and you want to prepare yourself for it.

I imagine the temptation right now is to say, “Look, I got away with it for a whole year, and now I’d never even dream of seeing Bob again. I finally understand what I risked by having an affair, and I’m willing to give my marriage all I’ve got. Telling my husband would mean losing everything because I’m sure he’d leave me, and maybe this panicking on my own is the best form of penance I can do for cheating on him. If I can just isolate, manage, and control this Bob problem, it’ll be my own way of making up for my infidelity without my husband having to ever find out.” But I think that’s a fantasy. It would be better to be honest with your husband so you can both batten down the hatches when it comes to your social media, phones, email addresses, etc., and for your own sense of isolation and guilt (and, I think, your husband has a right to know, after such a long and sustained affair). If the two of you are able to move past this eventually and rebuild a relationship together, that’s wonderful. But even if you can’t, my goal for you is to address and deal with your guilt and try to move on with your life, not endlessly berate yourself and panic in secrecy that your secret is about to come out and ruin your life.

Q. Office peep show: My colleagues and I decided to reach out to you with a problem that’s recently developed. Our office is on the seventh floor of a downtown building. Two streets away is a recently completed apartment complex with a penthouse level with two apartments with floor-to-ceiling windows. One apartment keeps the shades down. The other always has them fully up. The resident routinely walks around during office hours naked or in a bra and underwear. Today she walked out on her balcony undressed. The apartment is exactly in our line of sight (particularly in my office), and it’s impossible not to notice. This may seem funny or titillating to some, but we find this very distracting and unwelcome. What is the best course of action? Email the management company? Stop by the lobby and say something to the front desk person? Maybe she doesn’t realize just how visible she is.

A: Some of this is just the problem of urban living; you have tons of people trying to be professional/casual/relaxed/at home/in public/in private all at the same time, often in very close quarters. So while it’s certainly fine for someone to want to enjoy being naked in their own home (and I can imagine that someone on the seventh floor might not realize they’re very visible, even on a balcony), I can also understand that it’s not funny or intriguing when you’re trying to keep a meeting on track. I think your best bet is to pull down the curtains when you notice something especially eye-catching in your line of sight. You can, I suppose, ask the building’s managers to send an email around to residents asking them to be mindful of when they have their shades up or down, but I wouldn’t hold my breath assuming that this will have much effect or that you can make sure no one else in any of the buildings facing you will ever walk around the house in their underwear. Don’t make the front desk person worry about it; whether they’re security or a doorman, that’s a lot of extra work to ask of someone who just works in the building. If you’re going to make the request, make it of the building management, and phrase it in such a way that doesn’t target an individual (because, as you say, you don’t know that she’s doing it on purpose) so they can send out a general update.

As I am writing, someone just pointed out that Ask a Manager answered this last week; looks like we were of the same mind on the subject. (Is it just me, or are we seeing more and more simultaneous submissions these days? I admire the determination to get your question answered as often as possible.) Of course, it’s possible that more than one person works in a high-rise and occasionally sees someone in their apartment across the street in the same week. Either way, I’m happy to answer any questions, even if someone’s double-dipping.

Q. Tattoo privacy: I have a tattoo on my stomach. In social situations, I have a couple of friends who tell me to “show them [mine]!” when tattoos come up. In a lot of social situations, I don’t want to lift up my shirt and show people, especially people I’ve never met before. Is it rude to say no?

A: It is not rude! It is never rude to decline to lift your shirt at someone else’s prompting. If it’s the same few friends who have been repeat offenders, you can tell them you’re not always comfortable lifting your shirt to strangers (which should be obvious!) and they need to knock it off. Otherwise, you can just say, “No, thanks,” and let the conversation move on.

Q. Re: My parents won’t let my adult partner stay in my room: Do not give in to your parents on this. You are an adult, and they do not get a say in your sex life or relationships. Stay in a hotel during future visits and only go as often as you can afford. What they are doing is rude and controlling. Make it clear that if they want to be part of your life, they need to accept your choices and treat them with respect.

A: I don’t think this is the first approach the original poster is going to want to try, if only because they seem to otherwise really enjoy their relationship with their parents and are generally OK with some compromise on the sleeping-together-at-their-parents’-house rule. Obviously other people might want to take a hard line on this, which I completely understand. But it’s up to the letter writer to figure out just how much they want to push here.

Q. Re: My parents won’t let my adult partner stay in my room: Just wondering if what changed for the parents is that they previously assumed the cohabitation would eventually lead to marriage and thus were grudgingly accepting it. Did you recently tell them you had decided to remain as a committed unmarried couple, and did their behavior change after? Not sure if this changes what you do in the abstract, but if this is the issue, having the additional context might help inform the conversation you have with them.

A: Oh, that’s interesting! Yes, if that’s part of what’s changed for them, I think it’s better to figure out what will work for everyone (The letter writer continues to be unmarried, continues to direct her own sleeping arrangements at home/in hotels, declines to spend the night with parents OR the parents decide to privately disagree but not try to force her to change), rather than spend a lot of time arguing about a wedding that’s never going to happen. But it might just be that they’ve cycled back to a period of more religious conservatism; lots of people, in my limited experience, sometimes “snap back” after being a little more laissez-faire for a few years.

From Care and Feeding

Q. Why won’t my grown daughter answer my texts? My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old and I was 43. I love my daughter to death, marveling as she grew up, basking in her love, and returning in kind. I still love her so much, but there is something wrong in our relationship.

She has no difficulty in ignoring my texts to her, never mind my calls. It hurts me very much when she blows me off. She’ll say, “I never respond to texts from anyone,” but will immediately respond to anybody’s texts during those infrequent times we are together.

While I am far from the perfect father, I have always loved her without bounds. In the years after our divorce, I drank heavily, so I suppose that might have something to do with her behavior. Her mom has constantly tried to minimize my involvement in my daughter’s life. She was terrible in how she portrayed me to my girl. I always thought that my daughter would see through all that as she got older. But her apathy about our relationship hurts me deeply.

I have tried to speak with her about this, but she insists that she loves me very much. I’ve tried to take the approach that kids can be like this at her age, but I’m having serious doubts and am beginning to think there is something seriously wrong. Please help!","I don’t want to apologize, but I don’t know if my instincts are the best here.

34,"Biden Changes Mind, Says He’s Now Against Decades-Old Ban on Federal Funding for Abortion",Elliot Hannon,"Joe Biden addresses his political evolution on the Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions at a DNC event on June 6, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. Dustin Chambers/Getty Images

Joe Biden is eyeing a run against President Trump that stakes out the political center of the electorate, but that means he’s often running to the right of the current Democratic field. On Thursday, however, Biden reversed course, veering left on an issue that is of increasing importance for Democratic voters, the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions. Biden has supported the measure, which dates back to 1976, throughout his political life, with his campaign reaffirming its support as recently as this week. Amidst growing pressure, however, Biden announced Thursday he had changed his mind on the issue, saying that “circumstances have changed.” “We’ve seen state after state including Georgia passing extreme laws,” Biden explained. “It’s clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of Roe.” Other Democrats in the 2020 field have called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment because it prohibited Medicaid funding of abortion, which disproportionately affected poor women and women of color.

Biden expounded on his change of heart Thursday evening during a DNC-hosted gala in Atlanta. “I’ve been working through the finer details of my health care plan like others in this race, and I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,” Biden said. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s ZIP code.” Biden cited the growth of anti-abortion laws in states, particularly in the deep south, that has made abortion procedures more and more difficult to access, while also setting up a potential Supreme Court challenge to Roe v. Wade. “Folks, times have changed,” Biden said. “I don’t think these guys are going to let up.”

“At a time where the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Roe are under attack, we need full-throated allies in our leaders,” Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights group Naral Pro-Choice America, said of Biden’s reversal. “We’re pleased that Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party’s core values—support for abortion rights, and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country.”

Biden, a Catholic, hasn’t always hewed to the Democratic party line on abortion rights, but times have indeed changed. The Democratic Party he hopes to lead has shifted to the left in the era of Trump while anti-abortion legislation has gained traction in state legislatures. That puts the issue front-and-center in the buildup to 2020 and Biden’s stance on the Hyde Amendment was a potential point of attack for Democratic challengers looking to paint the former VP as out of step with the current mood of the party. Biden will likely still have some convincing to do for many on the left, but maintained that he would make “no apologies for the last position.”","Joe Biden addresses his political evolution on the Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions at a DNC event on June 6, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.

35,A five-minute Malaysian bread recipe for soaking up curry.,Yi Jun Loh,"Photo by Rocky Luten. Food Stylist: Samantha Seneviratne. Prop Stylist: Amanda Widis.

This recipe originally appeared on Food52.

Most people have experienced the milk-and-cookie dilemma. You know, the one where you get halfway through a cookie and realize you have no more milk to wash it down with. And so you pour out more milk, only to finish the cookie and still have a quarter-glass of milk left, forcing you to reach for yet another cookie, feeling guilt and pleasure at the same instant. Repeat ad infinitum.

Well, I have a version of that, but with curry and bread.

Countless times have I made a chicken curry, Malaysian rendang, or a Nik Sharma–inspired spiced stew for dinner, and labored over some flatbread or Indian naan to go with it. Only each time, often toward the end of the meal, I’ll realize that I’ve either made too much bread and not enough curry, or—and this is the much less desirable scenario—not enough bread for the amount of curry I’ve made, leaving a glistening pool of gravy just waiting to be mopped up. Only unlike the milk-and-cookie dilemma, I can’t just pour out some extra curry from a Tetra Pak in the fridge, and there’s no bread jar for me to sheepishly reach into for more bread.

For emergencies like this, I turn to roti jala.

Roti jala is a Malaysian bread that, unlike most breads, doesn’t require any leavening and proofing, and can be whipped up in a matter of minutes, using little more than pantry staples. In fact, its name—literally meaning “net bread” in the Malay language—is a bit of a misnomer, because roti jala is really more like a crepe than a bread.

To make it, all you need is some flour, water, eggs, coconut milk, and an optional pinch of turmeric for color. Whisk all of this into a smooth solution the consistency of pancake batter, then drizzle onto a hot pan to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, and it’s done! (That’s bread in about 5 minutes from start to finish; rinse, lather, repeat.)

Unlike a crepe, though, there’s no need to swirl the pan around and patch up the gaps in between, like you would a botched children’s drawing. For a roti jala, the gaps in the batter give it a lacy, doily-like pattern, reminiscent of fishing nets (hence, its name).

In Malaysia and Indonesia, roti jala features prominently in the local cuisine. They’re often folded into neat little bundles, served as a substitute for rice alongside creamy curries and spicy beef rendangs, and sometimes even had with the many aromatic, stew-like gulais of Malay cuisine. Once dipped into these spicy stews—by hand of course—the supple, slightly springy roti jala will immediately soak up all that sauce, and act as a vessel for the curry to get into your mouth, with the perfume from the coconut milk and the tinge of turmeric in the roti jala serving as a backdrop to the spice-laden canvas of the curry.

So whenever I have extra curry for dinner, I’ll immediately segue to the kitchen, whip up a roti jala batter and drizzle it on the pan. As the first roti is done, I’ll dip it straight into the still-warm curry and eat it with one hand. And with the other, I’ll drizzle in more batter to fry up the next roti, repeating the process until I’m left with an empty bowl, with barely a smudge of curry in sight.

Curry-and-bread dilemma, solved.

By now, you’ve no doubt come across a thousand endorsements preaching the gospel of the Baby Foot peel, a pair of booties that slather your feet in a gel concoction designed to loosen dry and cracked skin. About a week later, the skin begins to fall from your feet in giant sheets, revealing the foot of a baby that was hiding underneath. It’s basically a chemical peel for your feet, and I love it — but I don’t use it on the regular, as it makes even the skin on the tops of my feet and my ankles peel. I’m more interested in removing the calluses that build up on my feet from walking everywhere I go, and getting relief from the intense dryness that is a direct result of wearing sandals and exposing my feet to dry air all summer long.

I’ve bought and tried almost every foot cream, and I’ve always found them a bit greasy and lacking in enough moisture to really kill the dry, ashy bits at the ends of my toes and on my heels. But then I was idly browsing at my favorite beauty shop in Little Tokyo where, lo and behold, sat this lone tube of foot cream made by the same manufacturer of the beloved Baby Foot peel kit. I snapped it up even though I couldn’t read a word of the instructions (it’s a Japan-only product, but of course some enterprising individual has made it available on Amazon). I figured it was foot cream, so what could go wrong?

Not only did nothing go wrong, it was better than I could have dreamed. Where most foot lotions are greasy for a good half-hour after applying (making it dangerous to walk around the house, and also a pain to put on shoes and head out the door), the Baby Foot Deep Moist Shea Butter goes on dry, but somehow moisturizes flawlessly. I’m pretty sure they mean for it to be used after performing the classic Baby Foot peel, but I’ve been using it as a stand-alone foot cream for a few weeks, and it blows any other foot cream I’ve previously used out of the water. The dry texture is a little disconcerting on your hands, so I use a butter knife to apply it (sorry, anyone I’ve invited over for dinner recently), then rub my feet together to get it into every nook and cranny. The weird callus I’ve always had on my baby toe is noticeably softer, and I don’t have those weird dry patches at the ends of my toes by midday anymore. It dries instantly, so I can apply it right before I throw on my shoes and race out the door, never worrying that my feet are slipping and sliding around like they do with other, greasier foot creams I’ve tried. I may not be able to read a word of what the tube says — but the results don’t lie.

We did a very involved guide to taking care of your feet a few years back that’s still full of great nuggets. According to master pedicurist Lia Schorr, this is the ultimate foot cream: “This cream is natural and full of herbs. It has a strong medicinal aroma but will hydrate your feet, leaving them lovely and silky.”

ProLinc Callus Eliminator

Freer also told us about her pedicurist’s foot secret — the ProLinc Callus Eliminator. Here’s how to use it: “Soak your feet in a tub of warm water for five minutes. (I use this inflatable tub because it’s so easy to break down and store in between uses.) Apply a thin coating of ProLinc Callus Eliminator to your rough, callused foot parts, using a paper towel (you can also just use your hands, but make sure to wash them immediately afterward). Wait three to five minutes (no longer, as it could start to burn), then wipe any excess product off your foot with a tissue. Finally, it’s scraping time. I like using a pedicure-specific microplane rasp (though an old-school Mr. Pumice stone works well, too) and go to town. You’ll be shocked at how easily your calluses are turned to dust.”

CeraVe Renewing SA Cream

Beauty writer Hannah Morrill introduced us to this dermatologist-recommended cream that moisturizes while exfoliating during Feet Week last year. It also happened to be one of our best sellers of 2017: “The best contender I’ve found for this job? CeraVe Renewing SA Cream, which itself was developed with dermatologists and contains both exfoliant salicylic acid (that’s what the SA stands for) and ammonium lactate in the first ten ingredients, meaning the concentrations are significant, not an afterthought.”

Tweezerman LTD Pedro Callus Stone

Trust Kimbra Hickey — she’s a foot model. She told us about the best way she keeps her own money-makers looking camera-ready: “I exfoliate daily. This sugar scrub is grainy but not too harsh, and the ceramic stone is small, covered, and easy to travel with.”","Even that weird callus on my baby toe is softer.
But then I was idly browsing at my favorite beauty shop in Little Tokyo where, lo and behold, sat this lone tube of foot cream made by the same manufacturer of the beloved Baby Foot peel kit.
I figured it was foot cream, so what could go wrong?
I’m pretty sure they mean for it to be used after performing the classic Baby Foot peel, but I’ve been using it as a stand-alone foot cream for a few weeks, and it blows any other foot cream I’ve previously used out of the water.

37,"Hannity, Trump, and the Whole “Lock Her Up” Crew Are Absolutely Outraged at Pelosi’s Prosecution and Prison Comment",Elliot Hannon,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told Democratic leaders that she didn’t want to impeach President Donald Trump, something she has long been resistant to politically, but instead wanted to see him “in prison,” Politico reported earlier this week.* The comment was part of Pelosi’s greater argument that the best way to seek some modicum of justice when it comes to what appears to be criminal behavior by Trump outlined in the Mueller report is to wait until he’s out of office and no longer has presidential immunity to allow the legal system to run its course. It’s a strategic decision based on evidence that crimes appear to have been committed, namely obstruction of justice, among many potential others, that may ultimately be prosecutable. It’s also calculus that is largely deferential to Trump, as president, and relies on the now-quaint notion of the rule of law being used to redress past wrongs. Some Democrats don’t love Pelosi’s approach because they believe impeachment proceedings are the appropriate forum to address Trump’s apparent crimes. Fox News host Sean Hannity, on the other hand, was absolutely gobsmacked by Pelosi’s comments.

On his show Thursday night, Hannity oscillated between outrage and disbelief that Democrats might see a legitimate legal case for prosecuting Trump once out of office.

Hannity: Speaker Pelosi now apparently telling senior Democrats that she’d like to see Trump behind bars. Based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison? That happens in banana republics—beyond despicable behavior. And by the way, they would literally turn, in many ways, the USA into a country we no longer recognize.

Hmm … jailing political opponents, you say? Who on earth would suggest such an outrageous thing?

You get the idea.

Trump was actually asked about Pelosi’s comments and had typically Trump things to say. “I actually don’t think she’s a talented person,” Trump said. “I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would’ve liked to have gotten some deals done. She’s incapable of doing deals.”

I guess that counts as progress from the president.","Some Democrats don’t love Pelosi’s approach because they believe impeachment proceedings are the appropriate forum to address Trump’s apparent crimes.

Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Email careandfeeding@slate.com or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.

Dear Care and Feeding,

I’m looking for some different perspectives on whether to talk to my kids’ baseball coach about the things I’m hearing from the sidelines.

Let me start by saying that I really appreciate how much energy and work these volunteers put into our kids’ team. There are four parent coaches for a team of 9- to 10-year-olds. What I’m concerned about is the really intense coaching from the sidelines by the coaches. Though most of it is positive and constructive, I’m also hearing things like “Keep it simple, stupid” and “Move your asses.” All at top volume, and throughout the entire game!

My kids claim not to be bothered by what they hear, but it feels way too intense to me. Do I talk to the head coach? Do I just talk to my kids? An additional wrinkle: My husband is also an assistant coach but is much more mellow. Should I have him talk to the other coaches?

—Or Just Sit Back and Enjoy the Game

Dear OJSBaEtG,

Oh, boy. Yeah, you call my kid stupid, we’re going to have words. And “stupid” and “asses” are just completely inappropriate things to be yelling at 9- to 10-year-olds. We are not remaking Hoosiers, we’re having a good time with our middle-schoolers. Nor is this a situation where the losing team is to be culled to preserve food resources on a dying dystopian planet.

I would first talk to my kids (it sounds as though you already have), and tell them they should not pay any attention to those words, because the coaches who use them are being overzealous. Kids love being told they can ignore an adult. It’ll go fine. (Make sure you confirm they do listen and comply with noninsulting requests by their coaches.)

Then, I would have your husband email the other coaches. (I firmly believe this is not a cop-out; emailing someone instead of having a big group face-to-face allows people to go through their mad-defensive-explanatory phase on their own time, and gives things time to simmer.) He can just say (accurately) that he has heard from parents that they really don’t want the phrases you have mentioned to be used anymore, and We’re Here to Have Fun, It’s Just a Game, Billy Martin, etc.

Orange slices for all!

Dear Care and Feeding,

We love my daughter’s day care center. The teachers are incredible, the principal is amazing, the classrooms are very diverse, it’s actually affordable (!!!), and it’s five minutes from my and my husband’s offices. Literally the only downside to this place is that it follows the academic year, so we have to find alternate child care for the summer.

We were ecstatic when one of the school’s teachers agreed to watch our daughter in her home this summer. The teacher, I’m going to call her Zoe, is very warm and sweet, and my more reserved 2-year-old really clicks with her. Zoe has a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old, and we were excited about my daughter spending time with kids of different ages. We’re three weeks in, and my daughter is having a blast. She is excited to go to Zoe’s every morning, and is becoming good friends with the 4-year-old.

The problem is screen time. My husband and I allow my daughter very little screen time at home, and the day care center has a policy of no more than 30 minutes of screen time per week. Aside from a handful of family movie nights, a very occasional “OK, you can watch a clip from Moana” potty training incentive, and some screen time during road trips, she has had no screen time at all.

We’re more strict about screen time than any parents I know, which I absolutely realize is related to the privilege we have as a two-parent household with one kid. I get that parents in other situations sometimes need screen time to get things done, and we certainly have our own parenting compromises in other areas. I promise we very rarely (if ever) discuss screen time with other parents. We try very hard not to be sanctimonious about this: It’s important to us, but we try not to be assholes.

In the three weeks our daughter has been at Zoe’s house, she’s watched some TV every day. Once (on a rainy day) it was an entire movie, though more typically it seems to be a couple episodes of a half-hour show. It’s often at the end of the day, just before pickup, and my husband and I both feel like it’s affecting her behavior. It’s often really hard to get her to leave Zoe’s house, because she’s glued to the TV. She seems to be both more emotional and hyperactive when she comes home for the evening, which makes bedtime tougher, too. Plus we just don’t like that she’s getting so much screen time, based on all the research that it’s bad for kids.

Zoe does an amazing job getting the kids outside, and they go on daily adventures around the neighborhood or to nearby parks. They also make crafts together and read. We just found out that Zoe will be our daughter’s classroom teacher in the fall, which we know will make for a great transition back to the center for our daughter. We really like and respect Zoe as a teacher and a mom.

Is there any way to ask Zoe to cut back on the TV (or stop it entirely) without damaging the relationship we have with her, which we know will continue for at least another year? She’s of course letting her own children watch TV with our daughter, which complicates the issue. On one hand I feel like we’re paying for her services, and we have a right to make a request, but on the other I feel like she’s doing a wonderful job overall, and is probably exhausted at the end of the day from her own kids, plus mine, and perhaps this falls into the “raising kids is a series of compromises” category. Most importantly, we feel like we’ve finally found child care we love at the center, and we really, really don’t want to screw that up in any way. Help??

—Don’t Want to Be a Screen Time Sanctimommy

Dear Not a Sanctimommy,

So, were it me, I would let it go, basically. You don’t actually know if it’s the screen time making your daughter more emotional and reactive; after all, she’s now negotiating spending the day with two other kids of very different ages, when she’s not used to having siblings, in a less-structured environment than day care. Summer kids are always a little different from school-year kids, as well.

It’s also just not that much TV. A full movie on a rainy day, a couple of half-hour TV shows before pickup? I think you could very nicely mention to Zoe that you’re trying to limit screen time and ask that it get capped at an hour per day (as mentioned, you are indeed paying her), but I think that Zoe sounds like a really good child care provider who is generally keeping a very respectable balance and getting the kids out and crafting and so on.

I’m leaving it up to you. I think it’s highly unlikely Zoe will be offended if you ask for a reasonable cap on screen time. An hour a day, as mentioned, is reasonable, whereas rainy days are their own creature, and I wouldn’t dream of complaining about an appropriate kid movie to get through one. I also think you could just let it go.

What I would say to Zoe is that it’s really hard to get your daughter to go home if the TV is on at the very end of the day, so you would appreciate it if the last hour of the day is made up of quieter activities. Best of luck!

Dear Care and Feeding,

I just recently found out I’m pregnant—hooray!—and am now navigating the information overload that comes with Googling anything to do with pregnancy and birth. I have many questions, but for now, I am having a hard time deciding on a care provider. I know I am interested in the midwifery model of care within a hospital setting, which narrows my options to 1) a midwifery group practice run out of a hospital across town, or 2) a midwife group/OB combo option that’s affiliated with my current primary care doctor’s office.

Option 1 is much farther away from home (45 minutes), so I’d have a significant commute for all my checkups and eventual delivery, but I know a lot of folks who’ve gone here and rave about the practice. Option 2 means I’d have all the checkups at my current doctor’s building literally two minutes from work and would deliver at a hospital only about 25 minutes from home, but I don’t know anyone who’s used the midwives there and don’t love the primary care practice it’s affiliated with—I’d actually been looking to switch PCPs anyway, though that ultimately has nothing to do with the OB-GYN part of the practice.

So I guess I’m weighing convenience vs. reputation? I did look up all the important maternity care stats for each hospital, and visited both, and they are about equal on every front as far as I can tell—the biggest difference is one allows water birth. I am leaning toward Option 1 based on the word of mouth, but am I going to hate schlepping across the city all the time or regret picking a delivery location so far away? I realize these are somewhat unanswerable questions at this early stage, but I’d appreciate advice about how care provider location can and should factor into this decision, the first of many to come for this new human!

—Call the Midwives!

Dear CtM,

Here’s the deal: Right now, you’re gonna be cruising into appointments very sporadically, but as you get bigger and bigger and grumpier and grumpier, they want to see you way more often. Every two weeks. Every week. Find yourself going overdue, you may be hauling your butt 45 minutes away and back every two days.

I’d stick with the two-minutes-away practice, especially considering their stats and outcomes are essentially equal. I think if you take my advice, you will be glad you did, come Week 38.

Congratulations, and good luck!

Dear Care and Feeding,

We live in a close-knit townhouse community, share a garage with our immediate neighbor, and generally get along and enjoy our neighbors. But I’ve had a growing issue with the way a 16-year-old neighbor interacts and seeks out my 5-year-old daughter.

You may indeed ruin the relationship you have with your neighbors.

At first it was asking about her school day type of small talk, but now he tries to tickle her every time he sees her, almost aggressively, and follows her until I wedge myself in between and say it’s time to go. I have had to tell him to move away from the car passenger door so I could get her out because he was standing so close, to stop tickling her when she was walking up stairs and eating. If he sees she is not with us, he generally responds, “Oh, she’s not with you? OK, have a nice day.” We have taught our daughter clear boundaries since she could talk and that any touch she doesn’t like is unwelcome and she should loudly say to stop.

But she loves all of our neighbors and the attention! I’m completely uncomfortable with the way he seems to stalk her when she is present. I’m at odds on how to respond without ruining the good relationship we have with the family otherwise. I’ve been subtle and asked him to stop when it was a safety concern, and asked her in front of him if she wanted to be tickled. How do I address this? I don’t think he is aware of how creepy and icky it appears. Do I talk to the kid and explain it isn’t appropriate for him to follow her and touch her without asking? Do I talk to his mom? She is super sweet and also loves my daughter, but at a more appropriate level.

Making it even more difficult to act: There may be a difference of cultures, as they are first-generation immigrants, and there have been communication barriers before. Also, the son appears to severely lack social skills (making me think he might be on the spectrum). I definitely need to address this before I act out of anger and scare the kid permanently and ruin our relationship with the neighbors.

—Super Uncomfortable

Dear Super Uncomfortable,

I don’t love this. I think it’s inappropriate, physical, and escalating. I think your best bet is to be even clearer, at a time your child is not present, and ideally when his mother is present. You should say that you do not want him to physically touch your child, ever, and that you’re fine with waving hello, but that he cannot hang out by your car or wait for her when he knows she’s coming home, because these are the boundaries you wish to have for your child.

I wish this was an easy conversation! You may indeed ruin the relationship you have with your neighbors. He may be neuroatypical; he may have no ill intentions whatsoever toward your child. But I don’t think she should ever be unattended outside your half of the townhouse (you know this already), and “You are not allowed to touch our daughter or follow her, it makes us uncomfortable and is inappropriate” is the sort of clarity that can really benefit someone who won’t pick up on the hints and nudges and body language that you have been trying so far.

I’m sorry. This sucks. As you clearly understand, it’s better to be uncomfortable than to let this situation continue to build.

—Nicole

More advice from Slate

My daughter is 9 and wonderfully smart and creative. One of her favorite creative outlets is cooking. However, she has been somewhat brainwashed by cooking shows, which give the impression that cooking is wantonly combining ingredients to create culinary masterpieces. She wastes huge amounts of food creating inedible dishes based solely on her creative whims. What do I do?","Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column.

39,2019 Women’s World Cup: How France became the tournament favorite.,Eric Betts,"Eugenie Le Sommer of France. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Catherine Ivill - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images.

The world’s best women’s soccer team isn’t going to win the 2019 World Cup, but its players might win it for somebody else.

Olympique Lyonnais has won France’s Division 1 Féminine for the past 13 years and the past four Women’s Champions League titles. It features the best player from England (Lucy Bronze), France (Eugénie Le Sommer), Germany (Dzsenifer Marozsán), Japan (Saki Kumagai), and Norway (Ada Hegerberg, who won the Ballon d’Or in 2018 as the world’s top player).

The World Cup is not Space Jam, and Lyon’s team of Monstars will go their separate ways for the tournament (minus Hegerberg, who hasn’t played for her national team since 2017). But beyond the headliners, the club’s impact will be seen in the performance of host nation France, which enters as a co-favorite with the U.S. If the French win the title, they’ll owe as much to their domestic league’s resident superteam as to their host nation advantage.

Lyon employs seven of the top eight French players, including the team’s goalkeeper, three of four likely starters on defense, captain Amandine Henry, and Le Sommer. The spine of the team has essentially been preparing together for this tournament all season, and those months (or years) of additional reps have historically proved invaluable when trying to build a dominant national side.

The famous Hungarian men’s “Golden Team” of the 1950s––Olympic champions in 1952, World Cup runners-up in 1954, and the first foreign opponent to beat the English national team in England––was constructed on a framework of players who had been conscripted by the national service to play for the army’s team Honvéd. The dominant Dutch men’s team of 1974 had a core of players who had won three consecutive European Cups with Ajax. South Korea’s men’s national team spent three months together in a training camp ahead of its home World Cup in 2002 and rode its newfound cohesion (and some fortunate refereeing decisions) all the way to the semifinals.

France is hardly the only European squad to benefit from a core that spends most of its season together. England—fourth favorites behind France, the U.S., and Germany—draws nearly half its squad from Manchester City and Chelsea. Spain, perhaps not a threat to win the 2019 tournament but looking to move closer to contention, features 10 players who ply their trade at Barcelona. By contrast, the U.S. team is scattered among the clubs of the National Women’s Soccer League, with no more than four representatives from any one team and no more than two probable starters.

The U.S. women are hardly strangers. The team has played 30 games together since the beginning of 2018. But the U.S. has held an institutional advantage in the past: the funding to put on long training camps not just immediately before the World Cup, but before the Olympics and tournaments such as the Algarve Cup. That benefit is beginning to erode as investment increases globally. The U.S. team’s Group F opponent Thailand played only 10 games in 2014 before the 2015 World Cup, but its qualification for that tournament inspired the Thai federation to invest more money in developing women’s soccer. In 2018, it played 26 games and qualified for the World Cup for the second time.

The world’s soccer federations still have a long way to go toward resolving the gender pay gap, as evidenced by the U.S. players’ lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, but the disparity of investment is starkest at the club level. The money spent on female players’ salaries was so paltry a year and a half ago that a study found that all the players in the world’s top seven leagues earned about the same as Neymar by himself, approximately $42 million. It’s not hard to see why a committed spender, like Lyon, is able to create a dominant force. (The same isn’t true on the men’s side, where China’s attempt to manufacture a global men’s soccer power has gotten off to a halting start.) The distribution of that money on the women’s side is still uneven enough in many of the big European leagues that the best talent gets funneled to just a couple of clubs with better environments and higher pay scales.

That builds cohesion for those countries’ national teams in the short term, but there is potentially a downside of playing on a superteam. Some suspect that Lyon’s French players aren’t properly battle-tested for a big tournament like the World Cup because they win most of their club games at a jog. If France falls far short of the high standard set by its top club team, then maybe we’ve had it backward. Maybe the national squad is really a feeder team for Lyon.","The world’s best women’s soccer team isn’t going to win the 2019 World Cup, but its players might win it for somebody else.

40,"Emma Boettcher Is the Chill, No-Nonsense Jeopardy! Champ of My Heart",Ruth Graham,"Emma Boettcher. Jeopardy!

Chicago librarian Emma Boettcher made headlines on Monday when she ended James Holzhauer’s 32-game winning streak on Jeopardy! But history was not in her favor when she returned to defend the throne the next day. As Jeremy Samuel Faust noted in Slate earlier this week, a surprising number of so-called dragon slayers who took down the game’s longest-reigning champions have gone on to lose their very next games. When Alex Trebek introduced Boettcher’s second appearance on the show, he couldn’t resist reminding her of that history. “Remember, Nancy Zerg defeated Ken Jennings and lasted only one game,” the host said as he introduced the new champ. “Hmm …”

It’s early days in the Boettcher era, but I love her already. She is no Nancy Zerg. She appeared totally unfazed by Trebek’s Debbie Downer introduction on Tuesday. She opened the game by choosing the category “Vowelless Bible Books” (“VWLSS BBL BKS”) and briskly claimed every answer in the category, earning an appreciative burst of applause from the audience.* “You know your vowelless Bible books, young lady,” Trebek chuckled. (She ran the first category on Wednesday, too.)

Trebek chuckled again Tuesday when the “young lady” (Boettcher is 27) bet all her earnings on her first Daily Double. “Influenced by James, are we?” Boettcher’s face flickered ever so slightly with a mixture of confusion and annoyance. She won the Daily Double, and by the end of the first round, she had $14,200 on the board, more than four times the earnings of her nearest rival.

There was a reason Boettcher may have been perplexed by Trebek’s suggestion that she was “influenced” by Holzhauer. First of all, betting it all on a Daily Double is a classic move, not one of Holzhauer’s several real innovations in gameplay. Boettcher felt confident about going all in—a move she also made in her first game—in part because she had calculated her own accuracy rate at home and knew the odds were with her.

Why do I find Boettcher so endearing? Probably in part because she is not overtly charming.

More to the point, Boettcher barely knew who Holzhauer was. Her first episode taped in March, and Holzhauer’s 32-game streak did not begin airing on television until April. (Jeopardy! records episodes months before they air.) She found out about her competitor’s historic ongoing streak when she arrived on set, but she had not experienced the hubbub around it. “It was weird to be a daily watcher of Jeopardy! and somehow there’s this phenomenon that I’d never heard of,” she told the New York Times in an interview printed this week, accompanied by a photo of her smiling and holding a daisy. But Trebek returned multiple times in Boettcher’s second episode to the idea that she stood trembling in fear of Holzhauer. “How did you feel coming in to play against him?” the host asked during the contestant interview segment on Tuesday. Boettcher looked briefly stymied as he continued: “Were you intimidated, or did you just say, ‘Hey, I’m as good as anybody else?’ ” “Mostly the latter,” she said.

Boettcher’s confidence is well-placed. She’s not just a trivia buff who got lucky. She wrote her capstone project for her master’s degree in information science on Jeopardy! clues, analyzing whether a computer could determine how difficult a clue was based on characteristics like clue length and number of noun phrases. Before receiving the call to appear on the show this year, she had auditioned four times in person, starting in high school. She trained, she told the Times, by standing a few feet from the television, “buzzing” on a toilet-paper holder for practice.

That practice paid off when Boettcher beat the curse of the Jeopardy! Dragon slayers in her first game after vanquishing Holzhauer. She didn’t land on either Daily Double in the second round, but she still ended the round with more than twice the cash of anyone else onstage, ensuring her victory even before the Final Jeopardy clue was announced. “This was a runaway game for Emma,” Trebek said as the game drew to a close. Boettcher flashed another modest smile. And then she won again on Wednesday, too.

Why do I find Boettcher so endearing? Probably in part because she is not overtly charming. She sports a business-casual wardrobe and a no-fuss Dorothy Hamill wedge. She is not “ethereal, floating through the game with peerless grace,” as Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern wrote of Holzhauer. Holzhauer is a professional gambler who lives in Las Vegas; Boettcher is a university librarian in the Midwest. In her third game, on Wednesday, she flagged a bit in Double Jeopardy and did not secure her victory until the final question. She has worked tremendously hard to get where she is, trying out over and over and tracking her own scores at home for five years. And now she’s finally here, and she’s winning—$97,002 and counting. Her fourth episode airs Thursday.","Chicago librarian Emma Boettcher made headlines on Monday when she ended James Holzhauer’s 32-game winning streak on Jeopardy!

This week’s Ask a Teacher panel:

Cassy Sarnell, preschool special education, New York

I am a fourth grade teacher at a small charter school with only two classes per grade. We have a dedicated and talented staff and truly try our best to service the students. Next year our current director will not be coming back and a new one has already been chosen.

At the end of each year, the current teachers decide where students will go in next year’s classes. We discuss this carefully, taking into account personalities and academic achievement. We try very hard to create balanced classes so it will benefit the learners and the teachers. This past year, though, the current fifth grade teachers decided that one teacher would teach all of ELA and social studies, and the other teacher would teach all of math and science. I have no issue with this, but here is the problem: They decided to level the students by academic ability, thus creating a “low” group and a “high” group. From my perspective, the results have been not been positive. One class has a ton of behavioral issues because they are aware of their label and feel like they are in the “dumb” group. I know that some of the students labeled “low” feel some resentment, and rightly so!

I completely understand that sometimes we need to pull small groups by ability, but it goes against my teaching philosophy to constantly group kids at this age by ability, because then what do they have to strive for? I really want to do say something but am at a loss as to how. These are colleagues I get along with fine but they are more seasoned teachers, whereas I am only in my fifth year of teaching. I have dropped hints asking if they feel it was valuable, and whether they’ll do it next year, but I don’t think they’re budging. How can I appropriately bring this up with my new director coming next year without seeming like a snitch?

I really want to advocate for these kids in the lower group. I truly feel that some students I had last year who are in the “low” group are being viewed unfairly. I worked so hard to bring them to grade level and make them feel good about themselves, but now sometimes I see them and it’s like they don’t even care. I get it: Why should they? They obviously feel stupid (which they’re not!), and they don’t feel like they should put forth effort because they’ve been labeled as “low.” It’s heart-wrenching for me to watch so many of them completely lose confidence and hate school. It must be so demoralizing! I want to bring this up professionally, but just don’t know how or where to begin.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Teacher

Dear Concerned,

You do know how to begin—by writing this letter, you’ve already outlined your thoughts clearly and professionally. Now you need to figure out where to begin.

It sounds like as a staff you need a unified philosophy and approach to grouping students. (In fact, I’m a little unclear about how the tracking of the fifth graders came to pass—if you and your fourth grade colleagues made recommendations for balanced groupings, did the fifth grade teachers simply override your input? If so, all the more reason to open the discussion.) The good news is that with a new director coming on board and an existing precedent for thoughtful end-of-year team meetings, you’re in a perfectly natural position to initiate that conversation. It’s probably about time to schedule your usual meeting anyway; when it comes up, I would add something like, “Since the fifth grade team tried a new approach this year, I’d like to invite them to join this conversation, too, so we can all get on the same page about our recommendations for how to group the current fourth grade class next year.” If your new administrator is known to you, and available, invite him or her as well, for the same reasons.

Once in the meeting, I’d come out and ask about the groupings! You work in a very small school; it’s not like their decision to create homogenous ability groups is some covert operation you’re exposing. Try a simple, “Now that the year is over, how do you feel it worked to have a ‘high’ class and a ‘low’ class?” You may find that they’re more open to returning to mixed-ability groups than you predicted, and the plans for next year proceed smoothly.

Of course, they may feel like their choice was a resounding success. In that case, I’d be prepared with the points you outlined in this letter: Your philosophy about the implicit messaging of the tracking, the behaviors you observed in your former students, some recent research. You’re pushing back on other teachers’ decisions, and that always has the potential to get a bit contentious, but you said your school has a culture of dedication and putting students first; if you keep it respectful, open-minded, and framed around establishing consistency and what’s best for kids, I’d be surprised if the tone escalates beyond “robust professional debate.” Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that the team will choose not to track—despite all the points you make, the group consensus may still land on ability groupings, in which case I’m not sure what more you can do.

One other thing: I came away from this letter wondering why raising this issue feels so intimidating to you. The topic itself is important, and I certainly recognize the potential for disagreement, but asking “where do we, as a school, stand on tracking?” in an end-of-year transition planning discussion doesn’t strike me as the delicate, potentially explosive situation you describe. I think one of two things may be true here. One, you’ve got some internal work to do on your professional confidence. If that’s the case, don’t be shy about bringing your perspective to the table. I did a bit of a double-take when you described yourself as “only” in your fifth year of teaching. While you may not be the most grizzled veteran on staff, you’re no wobbly newbie, either! Two, this environment is more toxic than you’ve let on in your letter. I’ve never worked in a school that’s entirely free of rivalries and power struggles, but there’s certainly been a range from “everyone’s human and we’ve all got our flaws and vulnerabilities” to “Game of Thrones–esque shifting alignments and jockeying for control.” Hopefully your school is more of the former. If you actually work in Westeros, then this particular issue is a symptom of a bigger, super unhealthy problem, and I’d start looking elsewhere for work.

My son is in fifth grade and about to start middle school. He is a great kid all around, and in terms of school he is dutiful, listens well, is responsible, does his homework, has great friends, and generally does well and gets good grades. He prefers math and science at school over reading and writing, but he does read nightly at home. My question is this: His handwriting and spelling are atrocious. Do I need to spend some time having him work on these things this summer before he starts middle school? His teachers seem to know what he’s saying in spite of the bad handwriting and spelling (analisses for analysis, for example). But I look at his handwriting and spelling myself and shudder. He and I have had conversations about it over the years, but have never made any real concerted effort on either of these fronts since he’s doing well. And with other younger kids to take care of at home, I haven’t had the bandwidth to deal, but maybe it’s time. I’d love your thoughts.

—Trying to Weigh What Matters

Dear TtWWM,

Oh, your son reminds me of one of my favorite student writers of all time—he was inventive, and his stories had great structure … and his spelling was 100 percent phonetic. One time he wrote a story about the Revalooshunary War.

As for whether you should work on his spelling and handwriting over the summer, I think it depends. I’m a single mom of twin 4.5-year-olds, one of whom has Down syndrome, and so when you say you don’t have the bandwidth, I get it. Since becoming a mom myself, I’ve relaxed quite a bit my expectations of the academic tasks parents should pursue with their kids. I used to say parents should read with their kids for 20 minutes every night; now I sometimes blow off reading my kids a bedtime story! There are nights when getting their teeth brushed is all I can manage.

Also, it’s going to depend on your son’s middle school environment. Do they use computers for writing tasks? If so, well, that’s what readable fonts and spellcheck are for!

If not, yes, you could try to work with him on it. Here’s my suggestion: Don’t make him wrong. Tell him the way he’s doing it is OK, and you want him to have another tool for his belt. I used to be a strict prescriptive grammarian—there were rules we all must follow; things were correct or incorrect. After reading a lot of books and hearing people’s stories over the last 15 years, my relationship to grammar has changed. I still love studying it and understanding it, but grammar rules are classist, elitist, and ableist. In most instances, as long as you’re getting your point across to your audience, what’s the harm in nonstandard language (or spelling or handwriting)?

That being said, code-switching is a valuable skill, and knowing politically dominant English is an asset. So now I don’t correct my students’ grammar; instead, I tell them, “That’s how you’d say it with your friends, but in this argumentative essay, you need to write it this way.” With your son, you could say, “That’s how you’d write your grocery list—as long as you can read it, who cares? But let’s pretend you’re writing a letter to your congressperson,” and have him practice writing in his best handwriting and using the dictionary to look up the spellings of words.

But again, if it feels like too much for you, just enjoy your summer, and bring it up with his teachers at the beginning of the year. Let them know his specific struggles, and ask them to help. That’s what they’re there for.

—Ms. Scott

My wife and I moved to Belgium a couple years ago for career reasons but have kept our kids in an American school here since moving. Our younger daughter, 9, has a place in a French immersion program and is picking the language up well. Our older daughter is 12, misses home more, and does not have an available French immersion program for her grade level.

This year, fearing our family would remain inside the expat bubble forever, we applied to a local French-language school that has a strong reputation and a transition program for non-French speakers. A significant fraction of the students there are expats, many of whom do not speak French yet, so the school is well set up to help with the transition.

Our kids were accepted to the school starting next year, and now we feel unsure what to do with this amazing opportunity. We intend to stay in Belgium indefinitely,and want our kids to have the broadest array of options possible when they grow up. Fluency in a foreign culture and language would be a huge asset to them, and our younger daughter seems easily up to the challenge.

At the same time, we both recall acutely that it’s challenging enough already just to be 12 years old, and we worry about overwhelming our older daughter with a new language, new school, and new friends. Our oldest is very bright, but is more reluctant to jump into this new experience, and is generally less adventurous with these things than the rest of us.

The final complication is that the younger daughter’s acceptance is contingent on her sister attending the same school. So it’s all or nothing.

What should we do?

We’ve surveyed our friends and the results are 50/50, half saying we’d be crazy to miss the opportunity and the other half asking if we’ve lost our minds completely in pushing a reluctant 12-year old into this against her preference.

—Trapped in the Expat Bubble

Dear Trapped,

That is so hard!

My first thought was of course put your daughter in the French-language school. Immersion is absolutely the best and fastest way to learn a language.

But then I remembered my own exchange experience in Italy when I was 17. I went there for a year knowing not a word of Italian … and I was truly miserable. Within 10 months, I spoke fluent Italian—to the point where northern Italians thought I was southern Italian—but I was clinically depressed, and my previous issues with food became a full-blown, binge-eating disorder.

That memory made me reconsider. Kids are going through so many changes. Would it be better to let your daughter learn middle school content in her own language? Let her process the hormones and the growth and the social missteps in her mother tongue?

Alas, no. For three reasons, I’d still say put her in the French-language school.

First, she’s younger than I was. Our adaptability tends to decrease with age, and though 12 is not that much younger than 17, I established a pretty solid identity in high school. I developed a solid group of friends. I was a leader in the band and theater. I worked my first real jobs. So when I went to Italy and found myself effectively mute and helpless, it was jarring. I think 12-year-olds are still finding themselves and can acclimate more quickly and effectively.

Second, you said you plan to stay indefinitely. That means she absolutely needs a deep understanding of the language and culture. Think about the freedom she’ll gain when she feels confident speaking French.

Third, and most importantly, she still has you. When I was suffering from loneliness and culture shock in Italy, I went home every evening to a family who, while lovely, wasn’t my family. I didn’t have anybody to talk to. This was also in pre-internet days. I salivated at the mailbox for any word from back home. Your daughter will still eat dinner at your table. She can text her friends from her old school. She can plan sleepovers with English speakers.

Dunk her in. She might flounder for a bit, but eventually, she’ll swim.

—Ms. Scott

My daughter is 4 years old, and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 1. She has significant developmental delays due to this. She has been in a county special education preschool since she was 2 ½. She was first placed in half-day preschool but was switched to the full-day preschool autism class five months ago as she was not making progress toward her IEP goals. She has not been diagnosed with autism.

She has an upcoming appointment with a developmental pediatrician next month after being on a wait list for 8 months. During this time her seizures have worsened, and she tends to fall asleep after them while at school. We are working with her neurologist to try to get this under control, but it is difficult.

We just had her IEP meeting yesterday, and we were basically told she is not making progress, and they do not know how to teach her. Apparently they have not had this situation before.

They feel putting her back in the half-day preschool is best as it is a less restricted environment.

I feel quite concerned that she is not making progress, the school has admitted it’s not sure how to help her, and she is supposed to start kindergarten in 2020. I am not sure how to proceed. Is homeschooling a good option? Should this be discussed with the supervisor of the preschool program? I tend to be a quiet person and not to want to cause trouble, but I feel that my daughter is not getting what she needs. I would appreciate any advice.

—Dazed and Confused

Dear Dazed and Confused,

Your situation sucks. Let’s start there. I’m really sorry that you’re in a position where none of your choices seem to be ideal. Fortunately, though, there is some good news: You have a whole year before she starts kindergarten. That’s a long time. During that time, you can test some strategies for how to help her meet her goals before she starts grade school. Second, you have a developmental pediatrician appointment. Hopefully this physician will be able to offer you a unique perspective and provide some additional insight. Ultimately, I think this is the source of your problem—you’re missing some information about what’s happening with your daughter. I’m sure this is a source of great anxiety for you and your daughter.

My instinct says that homeschooling is not the best option. Kids who are homeschooled miss out on important opportunities to practice social skills and group problem-solving strategies that are found in the larger school setting, even in the most restrictive special education classrooms. I respect homeschooling, especially if parents have tried schools and found that it wasn’t the best option for their kids, but it’s never been my first recommendation.

As for whether you should talk to your preschool: Yes. In your situation, I would wait to have the developmental appointment, and then, once you’re armed with more information, you can first talk to your CPSE/school district person about what your school options are. Then, depending on what you find out more broadly about your district, you can have a conversation with your preschool directly.

The final thing I’d recommend for you more broadly is to reach out to your community. Epilepsy isn’t a particularly common diagnosis, but it’s not rare either. There are probably support groups for parents of children diagnosed with epilepsy, either in your community or online. One of the parents in my class has joined an online support group of parents of children with her son’s diagnosis, and she is consistently the most prepared parent at meetings with teachers and the district.

Talking to parents with similar experiences can help you find the exact language you need to advocate for your child. Parents are the most important advocate a child has, and getting advice from parents who have been in your shoes is invaluable. On top of that, you will get the unique emotional support that only someone who has had the same experiences as you can offer. Good luck!

Dear Trapped,

That is so hard!

My first thought was of course put your daughter in the French-language school. Immersion is absolutely the best and fastest way to learn a language.

But then I remembered my own exchange experience in Italy when I was 17. I went there for a year knowing not a word of Italian … and I was truly miserable. Within 10 months, I spoke fluent Italian—to the point where northern Italians thought I was southern Italian—but I was clinically depressed, and my previous issues with food became a full-blown, binge-eating disorder.

Alas, no. For three reasons, I’d still say put her in the French-language school.

My daughter is 4 years old, and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 1. She has significant developmental delays due to this. She has been in a county special education preschool since she was 2 ½. She was first placed in half-day preschool but was switched to the full-day preschool autism class five months ago as she was not making progress toward her IEP goals. She has not been diagnosed with autism.

She has an upcoming appointment with a developmental pediatrician next month after being on a wait list for 8 months. During this time her seizures have worsened, and she tends to fall asleep after them while at school. We are working with her neurologist to try to get this under control, but it is difficult.

We just had her IEP meeting yesterday, and we were basically told she is not making progress, and they do not know how to teach her. Apparently they have not had this situation before.

They feel putting her back in the half-day preschool is best as it is a less restricted environment.

I feel quite concerned that she is not making progress, the school has admitted it’s not sure how to help her, and she is supposed to start kindergarten in 2020. I am not sure how to proceed. Is homeschooling a good option? Should this be discussed with the supervisor of the preschool program? I tend to be a quiet person and not to want to cause trouble, but I feel that my daughter is not getting what she needs. I would appreciate any advice.

—Dazed and Confused

Dear Dazed and Confused,

Your situation sucks. Let’s start there. I’m really sorry that you’re in a position where none of your choices seem to be ideal. Fortunately, though, there is some good news: You have a whole year before she starts kindergarten. That’s a long time. During that time, you can test some strategies for how to help her meet her goals before she starts grade school. Second, you have a developmental pediatrician appointment. Hopefully this physician will be able to offer you a unique perspective and provide some additional insight. Ultimately, I think this is the source of your problem—you’re missing some information about what’s happening with your daughter. I’m sure this is a source of great anxiety for you and your daughter.

My instinct says that homeschooling is not the best option. Kids who are homeschooled miss out on important opportunities to practice social skills and group problem-solving strategies that are found in the larger school setting, even in the most restrictive special education classrooms. I respect homeschooling, especially if parents have tried schools and found that it wasn’t the best option for their kids, but it’s never been my first recommendation.

As for whether you should talk to your preschool: Yes. In your situation, I would wait to have the developmental appointment, and then, once you’re armed with more information, you can first talk to your CPSE/school district person about what your school options are. Then, depending on what you find out more broadly about your district, you can have a conversation with your preschool directly.

The final thing I’d recommend for you more broadly is to reach out to your community. Epilepsy isn’t a particularly common diagnosis, but it’s not rare either. There are probably support groups for parents of children diagnosed with epilepsy, either in your community or online. One of the parents in my class has joined an online support group of parents of children with her son’s diagnosis, and she is consistently the most prepared parent at meetings with teachers and the district.

Talking to parents with similar experiences can help you find the exact language you need to advocate for your child. Parents are the most important advocate a child has, and getting advice from parents who have been in your shoes is invaluable. On top of that, you will get the unique emotional support that only someone who has had the same experiences as you can offer. Good luck!

I am a fourth grade teacher at a small charter school with only two classes per grade. We have a dedicated and talented staff and truly try our best to service the students. Next year our current director will not be coming back and a new one has already been chosen.

At the end of each year, the current teachers decide where students will go in next year’s classes. We discuss this carefully, taking into account personalities and academic achievement. We try very hard to create balanced classes so it will benefit the learners and the teachers. This past year, though, the current fifth grade teachers decided that one teacher would teach all of ELA and social studies, and the other teacher would teach all of math and science. I have no issue with this, but here is the problem: They decided to level the students by academic ability, thus creating a “low” group and a “high” group. From my perspective, the results have been not been positive. One class has a ton of behavioral issues because they are aware of their label and feel like they are in the “dumb” group. I know that some of the students labeled “low” feel some resentment, and rightly so!

I completely understand that sometimes we need to pull small groups by ability, but it goes against my teaching philosophy to constantly group kids at this age by ability, because then what do they have to strive for? I really want to do say something but am at a loss as to how. These are colleagues I get along with fine but they are more seasoned teachers, whereas I am only in my fifth year of teaching. I have dropped hints asking if they feel it was valuable, and whether they’ll do it next year, but I don’t think they’re budging. How can I appropriately bring this up with my new director coming next year without seeming like a snitch?

I really want to advocate for these kids in the lower group. I truly feel that some students I had last year who are in the “low” group are being viewed unfairly. I worked so hard to bring them to grade level and make them feel good about themselves, but now sometimes I see them and it’s like they don’t even care. I get it: Why should they? They obviously feel stupid (which they’re not!), and they don’t feel like they should put forth effort because they’ve been labeled as “low.” It’s heart-wrenching for me to watch so many of them completely lose confidence and hate school. It must be so demoralizing! I want to bring this up professionally, but just don’t know how or where to begin.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Teacher

Dear Concerned,

You do know how to begin—by writing this letter, you’ve already outlined your thoughts clearly and professionally. Now you need to figure out where to begin.

It sounds like as a staff you need a unified philosophy and approach to grouping students. (In fact, I’m a little unclear about how the tracking of the fifth graders came to pass—if you and your fourth grade colleagues made recommendations for balanced groupings, did the fifth grade teachers simply override your input? If so, all the more reason to open the discussion.) The good news is that with a new director coming on board and an existing precedent for thoughtful end-of-year team meetings, you’re in a perfectly natural position to initiate that conversation. It’s probably about time to schedule your usual meeting anyway; when it comes up, I would add something like, “Since the fifth grade team tried a new approach this year, I’d like to invite them to join this conversation, too, so we can all get on the same page about our recommendations for how to group the current fourth grade class next year.” If your new administrator is known to you, and available, invite him or her as well, for the same reasons.

Once in the meeting, I’d come out and ask about the groupings! You work in a very small school; it’s not like their decision to create homogenous ability groups is some covert operation you’re exposing. Try a simple, “Now that the year is over, how do you feel it worked to have a ‘high’ class and a ‘low’ class?” You may find that they’re more open to returning to mixed-ability groups than you predicted, and the plans for next year proceed smoothly.

Of course, they may feel like their choice was a resounding success. In that case, I’d be prepared with the points you outlined in this letter: Your philosophy about the implicit messaging of the tracking, the behaviors you observed in your former students, some recent research. You’re pushing back on other teachers’ decisions, and that always has the potential to get a bit contentious, but you said your school has a culture of dedication and putting students first; if you keep it respectful, open-minded, and framed around establishing consistency and what’s best for kids, I’d be surprised if the tone escalates beyond “robust professional debate.” Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that the team will choose not to track—despite all the points you make, the group consensus may still land on ability groupings, in which case I’m not sure what more you can do.

One other thing: I came away from this letter wondering why raising this issue feels so intimidating to you. The topic itself is important, and I certainly recognize the potential for disagreement, but asking “where do we, as a school, stand on tracking?” in an end-of-year transition planning discussion doesn’t strike me as the delicate, potentially explosive situation you describe. I think one of two things may be true here. One, you’ve got some internal work to do on your professional confidence. If that’s the case, don’t be shy about bringing your perspective to the table. I did a bit of a double-take when you described yourself as “only” in your fifth year of teaching. While you may not be the most grizzled veteran on staff, you’re no wobbly newbie, either! Two, this environment is more toxic than you’ve let on in your letter. I’ve never worked in a school that’s entirely free of rivalries and power struggles, but there’s certainly been a range from “everyone’s human and we’ve all got our flaws and vulnerabilities” to “Game of Thrones–esque shifting alignments and jockeying for control.” Hopefully your school is more of the former. If you actually work in Westeros, then this particular issue is a symptom of a bigger, super unhealthy problem, and I’d start looking elsewhere for work.

My son is in fifth grade and about to start middle school. He is a great kid all around, and in terms of school he is dutiful, listens well, is responsible, does his homework, has great friends, and generally does well and gets good grades. He prefers math and science at school over reading and writing, but he does read nightly at home. My question is this: His handwriting and spelling are atrocious. Do I need to spend some time having him work on these things this summer before he starts middle school? His teachers seem to know what he’s saying in spite of the bad handwriting and spelling (analisses for analysis, for example). But I look at his handwriting and spelling myself and shudder. He and I have had conversations about it over the years, but have never made any real concerted effort on either of these fronts since he’s doing well. And with other younger kids to take care of at home, I haven’t had the bandwidth to deal, but maybe it’s time. I’d love your thoughts.

—Trying to Weigh What Matters

Dear TtWWM,

Oh, your son reminds me of one of my favorite student writers of all time—he was inventive, and his stories had great structure … and his spelling was 100 percent phonetic. One time he wrote a story about the Revalooshunary War.

As for whether you should work on his spelling and handwriting over the summer, I think it depends. I’m a single mom of twin 4.5-year-olds, one of whom has Down syndrome, and so when you say you don’t have the bandwidth, I get it. Since becoming a mom myself, I’ve relaxed quite a bit my expectations of the academic tasks parents should pursue with their kids. I used to say parents should read with their kids for 20 minutes every night; now I sometimes blow off reading my kids a bedtime story! There are nights when getting their teeth brushed is all I can manage.

Also, it’s going to depend on your son’s middle school environment. Do they use computers for writing tasks? If so, well, that’s what readable fonts and spellcheck are for!

If not, yes, you could try to work with him on it. Here’s my suggestion: Don’t make him wrong. Tell him the way he’s doing it is OK, and you want him to have another tool for his belt. I used to be a strict prescriptive grammarian—there were rules we all must follow; things were correct or incorrect. After reading a lot of books and hearing people’s stories over the last 15 years, my relationship to grammar has changed. I still love studying it and understanding it, but grammar rules are classist, elitist, and ableist. In most instances, as long as you’re getting your point across to your audience, what’s the harm in nonstandard language (or spelling or handwriting)?

That being said, code-switching is a valuable skill, and knowing politically dominant English is an asset. So now I don’t correct my students’ grammar; instead, I tell them, “That’s how you’d say it with your friends, but in this argumentative essay, you need to write it this way.” With your son, you could say, “That’s how you’d write your grocery list—as long as you can read it, who cares? But let’s pretend you’re writing a letter to your congressperson,” and have him practice writing in his best handwriting and using the dictionary to look up the spellings of words.

But again, if it feels like too much for you, just enjoy your summer, and bring it up with his teachers at the beginning of the year. Let them know his specific struggles, and ask them to help. That’s what they’re there for.

—Ms. Scott

My wife and I moved to Belgium a couple years ago for career reasons but have kept our kids in an American school here since moving. Our younger daughter, 9, has a place in a French immersion program and is picking the language up well. Our older daughter is 12, misses home more, and does not have an available French immersion program for her grade level.

This year, fearing our family would remain inside the expat bubble forever, we applied to a local French-language school that has a strong reputation and a transition program for non-French speakers. A significant fraction of the students there are expats, many of whom do not speak French yet, so the school is well set up to help with the transition.

Our kids were accepted to the school starting next year, and now we feel unsure what to do with this amazing opportunity. We intend to stay in Belgium indefinitely,and want our kids to have the broadest array of options possible when they grow up. Fluency in a foreign culture and language would be a huge asset to them, and our younger daughter seems easily up to the challenge.

At the same time, we both recall acutely that it’s challenging enough already just to be 12 years old, and we worry about overwhelming our older daughter with a new language, new school, and new friends. Our oldest is very bright, but is more reluctant to jump into this new experience, and is generally less adventurous with these things than the rest of us.

The final complication is that the younger daughter’s acceptance is contingent on her sister attending the same school. So it’s all or nothing.

What should we do?

We’ve surveyed our friends and the results are 50/50, half saying we’d be crazy to miss the opportunity and the other half asking if we’ve lost our minds completely in pushing a reluctant 12-year old into this against her preference.

—Trapped in the Expat Bubble

Dear Trapped,

That is so hard!

My first thought was of course put your daughter in the French-language school. Immersion is absolutely the best and fastest way to learn a language.

But then I remembered my own exchange experience in Italy when I was 17. I went there for a year knowing not a word of Italian … and I was truly miserable. Within 10 months, I spoke fluent Italian—to the point where northern Italians thought I was southern Italian—but I was clinically depressed, and my previous issues with food became a full-blown, binge-eating disorder.

That memory made me reconsider. Kids are going through so many changes. Would it be better to let your daughter learn middle school content in her own language? Let her process the hormones and the growth and the social missteps in her mother tongue?

Alas, no. For three reasons, I’d still say put her in the French-language school.

First, she’s younger than I was. Our adaptability tends to decrease with age, and though 12 is not that much younger than 17, I established a pretty solid identity in high school. I developed a solid group of friends. I was a leader in the band and theater. I worked my first real jobs. So when I went to Italy and found myself effectively mute and helpless, it was jarring. I think 12-year-olds are still finding themselves and can acclimate more quickly and effectively.

Second, you said you plan to stay indefinitely. That means she absolutely needs a deep understanding of the language and culture. Think about the freedom she’ll gain when she feels confident speaking French.

Third, and most importantly, she still has you. When I was suffering from loneliness and culture shock in Italy, I went home every evening to a family who, while lovely, wasn’t my family. I didn’t have anybody to talk to. This was also in pre-internet days. I salivated at the mailbox for any word from back home. Your daughter will still eat dinner at your table. She can text her friends from her old school. She can plan sleepovers with English speakers.

Dunk her in. She might flounder for a bit, but eventually, she’ll swim.

44,"In the New Black Mirror Season’s Standout Episode, Virtual Reality Lets Straight Men Have Gay Sex",Inkoo Kang,"Black Mirror’s “Striking Vipers.” Netflix

It’s easy to imagine a grim near-future in which Black Mirror perpetually chases the high of “San Junipero,” with diminishing returns. The Season 3 episode, which starred Mackenzie Davis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as a queer couple who could’ve only found each other in cyberspace, was the first in the series to give its characters a happy ending, imparting a much-needed dose of tonal unpredictability to a show notorious for its dystopian paranoia and despair about technology. But creator Charlie Brooker, who has written or co-written every episode since the series’ sophomore year, whiffed his intended follow-up to “San Junipero.” In Season 4’s “Hang the DJ,” a romance pitted against a dating algorithm abruptly gave way to the deflating twist that we should’ve trusted the algorithm all along. The episode’s most startling reveal was how little Brooker seemed to understand what made the love story tick.

Black Mirror’s three-episode fifth season, which is now available, is its shortest of the Netflix seasons, not counting one-offs like December’s interactive “Bandersnatch.” Overall, the new entries are an underwhelming lot. Andrew “Hot Priest” Scott is betrayed by a particularly weak script in “Smithereens,” which doesn’t divulge its rather mundane tech phobia until the episode’s final minutes. Much more fun—but irrefutably silly and melodramatic—is “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,” starring Miley Cyrus as a pop star whose exploitation by a family member is aided by gizmos too theoretical to strike genuine fear. The standout episode is meant to be “Striking Vipers,” named after a Street Fighter–esque VR game in which two longtime but now-distant friends—family man Danny (Anthony Mackie) and perma-bachelor Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II)—consummate an attraction to one another that neither man seems to realize he had harbored. In the digital guises of Lance (Ludi Lin), a Ryu-like martial artist with a hairless chest and bulging muscles on every surface of his compact body, and Roxette (Pom Klementieff), a Cammy-esque kickboxer with a platinum bob and black underwear peeking out of her short red dress, Danny and Karl find that their digital duels keep turning into mind-blowing sexual trysts. (The game, we’re told when they start throwing punches, “replicates all physical sensation.”)

Until its surprisingly unromantic resolution, “Striking Vipers” is one of the most ambitious and intriguingly enigmatic stories Black Mirror has ever told. [Spoilers ahead.] In contrast with most of the series, this installment resists giving us too many answers. We’re never quite sure what exactly the nature of Danny and Karl’s attraction is, for instance, or how the former’s differs from the latter’s. Foremost, it’s unclear whether the pals have sublimated their homosexual desire for one another into more socially acceptable targets (i.e., Danny’s wife, Theo, and Lance’s eyebrow-raisingly younger girlfriend, Daisy, played by Nicole Beharie and Monique Cynthia Brown, respectively), or whether the two men are only into each other as a (Asian, accented, athletic, aggressive, hella cheesy-looking) straight couple. We also never learn which elements play a role in their relationship: the secrecy, the escapism, the novelty, the role-play, their yearslong friendship, the safety of a game world free from prying eyes, the fluidity between homosociality and homoeroticism, the uncertainty of the genders, races, sexual orientations involved, and/or the ability to blur any and all categories. (Whew.) What we do know is that Theo and Daisy feel sexually neglected—with Theo suspicious that her husband’s having an affair—and that Danny is reluctant to blow up his nuclear family if his attraction to Lance isn’t “real.”

Do their touchless affairs even count as cheating? For most of the hour, “Striking Vipers” hums along on a delicious uncertainty, unfettered by Brooker’s customary didacticism. Eventually, though, the episode’s underwrittenness begins to sink the romance. Danny and Karl decide to meet up in person to gauge their physical attraction to one another in real life, and Karl, who’d enjoyed the “best sex of [his] life” with Lance, decidedly doesn’t enjoy their kiss. With Danny, the matter of his gratification is more unsettled—both the camera and Mackie play it coy. It’s at that pivotal juncture, when the emotional disjunct between the men is never more character-revealing, that it hits us how little we know about their IRL relationship to one another.

The conclusion of “Striking Vipers” is one in which technology assists in the queering and opening up of the central trio, to the satisfaction of each individual’s wants. Danny gets to stay in his heterosexual marriage, not least for his kids’ sake, and enjoy scheduled flings with his friend. Karl realizes that, when he isn’t with Danny, he prefers the company of his new cat to Daisy’s. And Theo, who had felt sexually stifled by her marriage, is free to pick up strangers on the nights when she and Danny have prearranged their strayings. The characters’ new situations flirt with ideas frequently associated with queerness—open marriages, a gay-ish affair, the ability to transition between male and female bodies—but the amorphousness of their relationship and the heavy emphasis on protecting Danny and Theo’s union make the ending feel less like a romantic micro utopia than an optimization of heterosexual marriage, one that eliminates the destabilizing threats of new urges and sexual exploration. Danny and Karl’s erotic ardor is ultimately domesticated and instrumentalized in the same way that Danny and Theo’s sex life was, at least temporarily, dedicated to maximizing her chances at getting pregnant. If we had a better understanding of what drew Danny and Karl to each other, we could better root for their relationship. But without those crucial details, it just feels like the best ending Black Mirror can give us is scheduled sex.","Black Mirror’s “Striking Vipers.” NetflixIt’s easy to imagine a grim near-future in which Black Mirror perpetually chases the high of “San Junipero,” with diminishing returns.

45,A five-minute Malaysian bread recipe for soaking up curry.,Yi Jun Loh,"Photo by Rocky Luten. Food Stylist: Samantha Seneviratne. Prop Stylist: Amanda Widis.

This recipe originally appeared on Food52.

Most people have experienced the milk-and-cookie dilemma. You know, the one where you get halfway through a cookie and realize you have no more milk to wash it down with. And so you pour out more milk, only to finish the cookie and still have a quarter-glass of milk left, forcing you to reach for yet another cookie, feeling guilt and pleasure at the same instant. Repeat ad infinitum.

Well, I have a version of that, but with curry and bread.

Countless times have I made a chicken curry, Malaysian rendang, or a Nik Sharma–inspired spiced stew for dinner, and labored over some flatbread or Indian naan to go with it. Only each time, often toward the end of the meal, I’ll realize that I’ve either made too much bread and not enough curry, or—and this is the much less desirable scenario—not enough bread for the amount of curry I’ve made, leaving a glistening pool of gravy just waiting to be mopped up. Only unlike the milk-and-cookie dilemma, I can’t just pour out some extra curry from a Tetra Pak in the fridge, and there’s no bread jar for me to sheepishly reach into for more bread.

For emergencies like this, I turn to roti jala.

Roti jala is a Malaysian bread that, unlike most breads, doesn’t require any leavening and proofing, and can be whipped up in a matter of minutes, using little more than pantry staples. In fact, its name—literally meaning “net bread” in the Malay language—is a bit of a misnomer, because roti jala is really more like a crepe than a bread.

To make it, all you need is some flour, water, eggs, coconut milk, and an optional pinch of turmeric for color. Whisk all of this into a smooth solution the consistency of pancake batter, then drizzle onto a hot pan to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, and it’s done! (That’s bread in about 5 minutes from start to finish; rinse, lather, repeat.)

Unlike a crepe, though, there’s no need to swirl the pan around and patch up the gaps in between, like you would a botched children’s drawing. For a roti jala, the gaps in the batter give it a lacy, doily-like pattern, reminiscent of fishing nets (hence, its name).

In Malaysia and Indonesia, roti jala features prominently in the local cuisine. They’re often folded into neat little bundles, served as a substitute for rice alongside creamy curries and spicy beef rendangs, and sometimes even had with the many aromatic, stew-like gulais of Malay cuisine. Once dipped into these spicy stews—by hand of course—the supple, slightly springy roti jala will immediately soak up all that sauce, and act as a vessel for the curry to get into your mouth, with the perfume from the coconut milk and the tinge of turmeric in the roti jala serving as a backdrop to the spice-laden canvas of the curry.

So whenever I have extra curry for dinner, I’ll immediately segue to the kitchen, whip up a roti jala batter and drizzle it on the pan. As the first roti is done, I’ll dip it straight into the still-warm curry and eat it with one hand.

In fact, its name—literally meaning “net bread” in the Malay language—is a bit of a misnomer, because roti jala is really more like a crepe than a bread.
To make it, all you need is some flour, water, eggs, coconut milk, and an optional pinch of turmeric for color.
In Malaysia and Indonesia, roti jala features prominently in the local cuisine.
So whenever I have extra curry for dinner, I’ll immediately segue to the kitchen, whip up a roti jala batter and drizzle it on the pan.","['soaking', 'jala', 'signing', 'recipe', 'coconut', 'bread', 'ill', 'milk', 'roti', 'batter', 'malaysian', 'fiveminute', 'curry', 'turmeric']",2019-06-07 10:33:00.279000+00:00,https://slate.com

47,Elon Musk's Hyperloop is now borrowing ideas from trains and cars.,Henry Grabar,"Just don’t try to look out the window. Virgin Hyperloop One

For transportation nerds, Elon Musk’s Hyperloop holds a special place in the imagination. Progress in the space usually involves incremental steps to suit the places we’ve already built. Road tolls and electric scooters are what passes for exciting. The Hyperloop, as described by Musk in a 2013 white paper, is a 760 mph leap that promises whole new patterns of settlement and activity to follow behind it.

The real Hyperloop will be powered by magnets, but so far it has made its way through the world propelled by hot air. Credulous, click-chasing reporters have broadcast the claims of various Hyperloop entrepreneurs who have run with Musk’s idea of shooting pods through a sealed tube at high speeds, and local governments have gone right along with it. A working full-scale Hyperloop is still years away from reality, but I, for one, already feel like I’ve been taken for a ride.

Last year, I checked in with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, a company that hopes to pioneer terrestrial transit at the speed of sound using a cadre of far-flung engineers collaborating on Google Docs. It has been two-plus years since HTT’s co-founder told Wired, “We’ve solved all the technical issues,” but the team has yet to test a full-scale prototype. That hasn’t stopped HTT from getting government funding from Ohio to the Chinese hinterland.

Something interesting is happening as HTT and other firms move forward with their plans: The Hyperloop is starting to look more familiar than space-age. The HTT car, for example, is not the bobsled-size carriage imagined by Musk, but closer to the size of a needle-nosed Shinkansen train car. That design choice brings the idea of Hyperloop infrastructure away from Musk’s initial vision of a nimble, easy-to-build pipeline and closer to the costly, time-consuming right-of-way whose pursuit characterizes the construction of roads and railways.

The vehicle isn’t the only part of the Hyperloop that’s coming to resemble more traditional transportation options.

Recently, I sat down with Josh Geigel, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Virgin Hyperloop One, the more serious Hyperloop venture. What Hyperloop One has going for it is an actual test track where reporters have been invited to watch a pod achieve speeds of 240 miles per hour.

But that’s just the technology. As a transportation solution, Hyperloop One is starting to lay down some parameters on what will and won’t work. (It may be the influence of CEO Jay Walder, who ran transit systems in Hong Kong and New York.) Carrying small numbers of people, as the initial concept aimed to do? “I can’t imagine a system moving less than 4,000–5,000 people an hour and paying for itself,” Geigel said. Routes stretching across the country? The sweet spot, said Geigel, would be under 200 miles.

When Geigel outlined how his tubes would load up 16,000 passengers per hour on its first projected route near Mumbai—a carrying capacity approaching the Tokyo–Osaka Shinkansen, the world’s busiest high-speed train line—he explained that the system would launch “convoys” of “pods” that would leave the hub together and wind up in different destinations.

In short, Hyperloop One’s project is beginning to sound a bit like a high-speed rail line. Not coincidentally, Geigel is now estimating the system costing 60 to 70 percent the cost of high-speed rail—not, as Musk once projected, 10 percent or less.

No one is making more Hyperloop plans than Musk, whose Boring Company has committed with varying degrees of seriousness to build tunnels under Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles.

But at the prototype tunnel in the company’s L.A. headquarters, the model has evolved from tunnels carrying cars on skates to, well, a kind of infernal transportation Cat-Dog.

Aaron Gordon at Jalopnik sums it up:

Yes, for those keeping score, in a mere two years we’ve gone from a futuristic vision of electric skates zooming around a variety of vehicles in a network of underground tunnels to—and I cannot stress this enough—a very small, paved tunnel that can fit one (1) car.

Asked to describe why he had moved from the “cars on skates” plan to a regular one-lane auto tunnel, Musk said on Twitter, “This is simple and it just works.”

In its first public-facing commission, beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Boring Company is working on something that will sound familiar to anyone who’s been to an airport: autonomous, electric buses with rubber wheels driving around a closed system underground.

So, will we one day travel from town to town like spitballs in a straw? Maybe! But not if, when starry-eyed technologists come to face the reality of regulations, rights-of-way, and economics, they find something to like in the way things have always been done. Turns out it’s easier to use the wheel than to reinvent it.","Virgin Hyperloop OneFor transportation nerds, Elon Musk’s Hyperloop holds a special place in the imagination.

48,The Democratic Candidates Ought to Debate Climate Change Policy,Zoya Teirstein,"Democratic presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee speaks about climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

This story was originally published by Grist and has been republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee wants the Democratic National Committee to host a climate change–themed debate. Apparently, so do nearly a half-dozen of the other 22 Democrats who have thrown their hats into the 2020 race.

Despite mounting pressure from candidates and activists alike, Inslee’s campaign said the DNC informed it on Wednesday that a climate-focused debate had relatively the same survival outlook that the U.N. recently gave 1 million of the Earth’s species. Basically: poor.

Not only did the party’s leadership say there will be no climate debate—the Washington governor said in a statement that he was told that if he participates in any non–DNC-affiliated debate, he would not be invited to future debates held by the committee. (According to Mother Jones, Insee is considering defying this order nevertheless.)

Inslee expressed his disappointment with the DNC during an appearance Wednesday night on the CNN show Erin Burnett OutFront. “The grassroots of our party are demanding that we pay attention to this existential threat,” the governor said. “That’s outrageous to me to muzzle candidates who want to go out and have this debate. And I will tell them that what I’m hearing across the country is Democrats are insistent that we call the candidates to a higher plane of discussion of this, which was ignored for the last 20 to 30 years.”

Presidential candidate Jay Inslee calls the DNC's decision to not hold a debate on climate change ""extremely disappointing.""

Of the DNC barring candidates from participating in other debates, Inslee says ""it is totally unacceptable...to muzzle candidates.""https://t.co/l1w8hl5iS8 pic.twitter.com/uIYtGvC34X — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) June 6, 2019

The Sunrise Movement, a mostly youth-led group of environmental activists, called the DNC’s decision outrageous. “Almost every major candidate has supported the call for a Climate Debate,” Varshini Prakash, Sunrise co-founder, said in a statement to Grist. “It is an outrage to not only deny the American people an opportunity for a real debate on the greatest existential threat of our time, but threaten any candidates who participate in a climate debate.”

The organization is planning a climate-themed protest at the second Democratic primary debate in Detroit this July. It wants to clearly show that young people care about this issue and that older generations need to get on board. “This is exactly why we’re assembling in Detroit by the thousands this summer,” Prakash said in her statement. “The political and media establishment have spent our entire lives not taking this crisis seriously.”

In a statement to the Daily Beast, DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa laid out the party’s case: “While climate change is at the top of our list, the DNC will not be holding entire debates on a single issue area because we want to make sure voters have the ability to hear from candidates on dozens of issues of importance to American voters.” Hinojosa added that climate change should have been a bigger issue during the 2016 cycle.

Well, we can’t argue with that. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton spent fewer than six minutes discussing the issue during their three presidential debates in 2016. No wonder Inslee, the so-called climate candidate, wants a climate-focused debate! If 2016 trends repeat, he’ll only get a few minutes to get his main message out to voters.

“I hope the other aspirants to this office join me,” Inslee told CNN’s Burnett, “to ask the DNC to reconsider this. America deserves this. Our party deserves this. We are the Democratic Party. We believe in democracy.”","Jay Inslee speaks about climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday in New York City.

49,"Dwarf Fortress: in praise of the impossible, beautifully weird game that maybe gave us Fortnite.",Evan Urquhart,"Screenshot of Dwarf Fortress.

Of the five settlers who had just recently joined my growing dwarven community, this one stood out. Older than the others, Urist had a history steeped in blood, hunger, and rage. Though she looked like all the other dwarves—a tiny smiley face on a colorful rectangular field of numbers, letters, and punctuation—I checked out her backstory and deduced that she had to be some kind of werebeast. As quickly as I could, I input the commands to have a mining dwarf wall her up in a small cell. In theory, she could have stayed there forever, the infection contained, allowing my colony to thrive. Instead, I forgot about her and later directed a dwarf to dig out an area that included one of the walls of Urist’s prison. She was freed, assuming weregiraffe form on the full moon and attacking the other dwarves mercilessly. This is just how things go in Dwarf Fortress, a game of infinite possibilities, most of them bad.

Consumers of culture are accustomed to the idea that an album can be a commercial failure but succeed as art through its innovation and influence. We’re not used to finding the same dynamic in video games. Depending on your point of view, Dwarf Fortress could be a backwater of the medium or a raging current, a toy for detail-obsessed oddballs who enjoy playing God, or a flourishing source of inspiration, aspiration, and new ideas for indie developers and major video game publishers alike. If you can get past the difficult interface, it can even be pretty fun to play.

Once you experience Dwarf Fortress, you begin to notice its tropes elsewhere. Early in a match of Fortnite—still, at the moment, the most popular video game in the world—players must collect wood, stone, and brick from trees and structures. Later, they’ll use these materials to build pathways and defensive structures, or gain the high ground as the playable area of the game’s map shrinks, forcing the surviving players into a tighter space. Although the weapons and the shooting are important, the best builder is usually the winner of the battle royal. Fortnite came by its gather-then-build mechanic by way of another huge game, Minecraft. But even that was predated by Dwarf Fortress, where embarking dwarves (smiley faces) cut trees (brown zeroes) and build complex structures and machines, which also look like numbers, letters, or other ASCII characters. Dwarf Fortress is visually terrible, insanely difficult, and beautifully weird. It’s the video gaming world’s equivalent of John Coltrane’s Giant Steps or some crazy Captain Beefheart track, foundational music that alienates and scares those of us who are just looking for a beat to bop to, but whose influence you see everywhere, once you know where to look.

A budding tactician can train and patrol a military. A hunter can send out dwarves in search of dangerous underground beasts. A romantic can tend to their dwarves’ personal lives.

Dwarf Fortress has had tens of thousands of players (many of them coders and game developers themselves) since the earliest version was made available in 2006. Unlike most modern games, it is the product of a single coder, Tarn Adams, with creative input from his brother, Zach. Adams considers the free-to-play game, already remarkable for its depth and complexity, to be about 40 percent finished, although he recently agreed to work with members of his fan community to bring a paid version of the game to Steam, with modest improvements on the graphics. (The original version is gratis on his website.) Adams embodies a model of game developer as passionate, monomaniacal auteur, the opposite of the mainstream image of games as corporate, capitalist, and possibly addictive—not to mention collaborative works of entertainment, not solitary, personal works.

Like Coltrane’s jazz, the complexity and differentness of Dwarf Fortress are what make it difficult for those who aren’t already steeped in coding and gaming history to approach. While the unofficial motto of Dwarf Fortress is “Losing is fun,” a more accurate motto for the new player might be “Staring at an undifferentiated hash of ASCII characters without any idea of what is going on or how to affect it is fun—really!” Dwarf Fortress has no in-game tutorials (new players will have to go to the wiki for that), which is particularly irksome because the controls are unintuitive in the same way that building an airplane from scratch would be. Only after getting over the hurdle of figuring out what you’re looking at and how to use the menus to direct your dwarves can players begin to experience the real “fun” of having their carefully barricaded hole in the ground infiltrated by a weregiraffe and all their dwarves murdered or turned into weregiraffes themselves.

There is a genre of games that are difficult for the sake of being difficult, but Dwarf Fortress isn’t one of those—it’s impenetrable, but sincerely so. Played in a procedurally generated world with rules governing everything from weather patterns to dwarven temperament, it’s more simulation than game, and as simulations go it is deeply textured and incredibly complex. For example, there are 21 possible soil layers, 25 stone layers, and a further 50 types of stone that can be found in pockets and veins. There are 72 types of trees, many of which bear fruit. These trees grow based on biomes, which include tropical moist broadleaf forests and temperate coniferous forests and four more kinds of forest as well as deserts and mountains and salt marshes and more. Elements of the game often interact with one another—for instance, each dwarf has preferences, so a banana-loving dwarf will be overjoyed if the food all has bananas in it, but a rain-hating dwarf may sulk if he gets sent outside, which could lead to work stoppages or even violence.

For those who stick with it, this richness allows players to make of the game whatever they want. A builder can barricade their dwarves underground and build fantastic structures. A budding tactician can train and patrol a military. A hunter can send out dwarves in search of dangerous underground beasts. A romantic can tend to their dwarves’ personal lives. This is what draws in the tinkerers and developers and, well, cranks who play the game for free and sustain the Adams brothers with their donations and their continuing interest in every successive release. Tweaks are big and small, but always with the aim of simulating a rich world where a player can create and take part in new stories and adventures every time. One long-anticipated change, for example, will be the creation of a system for magic, an essential element to any fantasy world.

Although there have been attempts to create a more-accessible successor to Dwarf Fortress with games like RimWorld, you’re more likely to notice its influence in bits and drips. Minecraft (created by Markus Persson, who has credited Dwarf Fortress as a major influence) ushered in a craze for having building elements in games. These children and grandchildren of Minecraft often contain echoes of the specific building mechanics of Dwarf Fortress. Because of Minecraft, there is Terraria (a 2D Minecraft-like game), where building becomes a core component of strategy as the player makes arenas in which to tackle successive boss fights. In Block Fortress, another Minecraft-influenced game, building is in service to a tower-defense game. Larger gaming studios have been influenced as well. In addition to Epic Games’ Fortnite, Bethesda’s Fallout 4 incorporates building with materials scavenged from post-apocalyptic Massachusetts, which can be used by the player to build houses, settlements, and bases. (Bethesda also came out with the mobile title Fallout Shelter, which offers a colony management experience that is more directly comparable to Dwarf Fortress, although it’s orders of magnitude simpler and easier to play).

There are also direct references to Dwarf Fortress hidden in better-known games like World of Warcraft (which included a quest called “Dwarf Fortress” and two dwarven characters who made references to the game), Starcraft II, Runescape, and many more. And there are other more-elusive influences too. Beyond the building trend, there’s emergent gameplay, the term for unexpected or novel complexity that springs out of the interaction between simpler game elements. Dwarf Fortress is at once reaching for more emergence and embodying it at its best—the less-popular “Adventurer Mode” of the game is intended to take the simulated world and make it a background for emergent storytelling with a single protagonist, although for the moment that mode remains flatter and less satisfying for most players than the “Fortress Mode,” in which the player tinkers directly with the simulation itself. This desire for emergence has been at the heart of game designers’ search for ways to make nonplayer characters in story-based video games seem less flat, repetitive, and two-dimensional—in other words, more alive. This is an ongoing quest, but the independence and individuality of dwarves who form friendships, have likes and dislikes, are impacted by trauma, and even have something like proclivities and personalities has been as successful as anything that’s currently in more polished, mainstream franchises like The Sims.

It takes far more effort to learn an obscure but brilliant game like Dwarf Fortress than it does to pick up more polished, mainstream fare. But I think there’s an upside to being slowed down and forced to think, and to struggle to understand what’s going on. Instead of being carried away to a preset destination, Dwarf Fortress makes you think hard about where you want to go and question why you’ve been so willing to let other games make those decisions for you. Without Dwarf Fortress, some of the biggest games of the past decade might not exist at all, but just as important is the game and its developer’s stubborn insistence that there is more to making and playing games than the desire to addict people and take as much of their money as possible. In an environment where microtransactions make much of what passes for gaming seem more like compulsive gambling, and where visually stunning games can be shallow, repetitive and dull, that’s a huge accomplishment. Not as huge as keeping that weregiraffe contained, though.","Screenshot of Dwarf Fortress.

50,The clash over regulating online speech is global.,David Kaye,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Michael Burrell/iStock/Getty Images Plus.

Regulation of social media is coming. But there is something strikingly missing from the American and European debates over the future of social media: the world beyond.

Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are global platforms. Yet, Americans discuss platform regulation as if it’s only about American interests; the same is true in Europe, the leading force for online speech regulation in the democratic world today. I get that. That’s how legislators think, worldwide—how can I protect and promote my constituents’ interests?

But consider also what Colin Powell said about Iraq (and Pottery Barn): You break it, you own it. Here it should be: You built it, you own it.

American companies have come to dominate the globe, replacing public forums with corporate news feeds. They hunger for content—the more speech, the more engagement, the more advertising dollars—and then struggle to moderate unfathomable amounts of it.

They have provided platforms for public debate in places where the state has captured, owns, or represses print and broadcast media. But they are also platforms for advocacy of ethnic cleansing, livestreaming of violence, encouragement of attacks on refugees. Both the good and the bad of online media worldwide need to be considered in any regulatory scheme.

American companies have a responsibility to protect the people they have enticed to become their avid users. And in turn, U.S. and European regulation must get this right for them and their global users. Breaking up the dominant companies may be part of the answer, as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and many others argue. But even they acknowledge that competition policy alone is not the answer for the problems of online speech.

So what should that regulation look like? Companies and governments, thinking globally, must be guided by three basic principles:

First, ultimately public rules and public institutions—especially the courts in democratic societies—must play a central role in deciding what is and is not lawful. But that’s not how it’s working out. Governments flounder, politicize, and pontificate, often using the platforms to censor content, demanding takedowns that their own law would bar them from doing themselves. In Europe, public authorities demand that companies “eradicate” often vaguely defined online harms. They embrace a rhetoric of digital danger, feeding nicely into talking points for illiberal governments cracking down on online speech.

The experience of Germany is instructive. In 2015, as Germany began welcoming 1 million refugees, social media lit up with hatred and harassment. You are not welcome here, the far right bullied, their posts amplified and spread by both humans and bots. Some converted online threats to violence on the streets.

Heiko Maas, then Germany’s justice minister, was outraged, as much by the content as by social media’s failure to deal with it. After trying to get the companies to comply voluntarily with German law, and then feeling betrayed by company incrementalism, Maas conceived the Network Enforcement Act, or NetzDG. NetzDG, adopted by the German Bundestag in 2017, requires the largest companies to enforce provisions of German law that prohibit incitement to violence, Nazi symbols, and criminal insult, taking down content quickly when it is “manifestly illegal.”

NetzDG is a democratic state’s effort to reaffirm public norms over corporate dominance. But it is not courts or independent agencies deciding what is lawful. American companies do that. NetzDG effectively blesses private companies as judge, jury, and enforcer.

Human rights standards protect all sorts of speech, but they do not require free-fire zones of disinformation, hatred, and harassment.

Maas’ model is spreading across Europe and around the world, reinforcing corporate control of online speech rules. A new proposal from France may put independent agencies and courts in a critical role of oversight. Such creative thinking is essential to ensure that our future public forums are not regulated by, as one European official put it to me, the “profit-making beasts” of social media.

Second, companies and governments are opaque and bureaucratic, creating a digital enforcement process that Kafka would have recognized. A strong regulatory framework would require that companies open up to public scrutiny their rule-making processes and their specific decisions, with appropriate privacy protections. Governments should require disclosures for better understanding of the artificial intelligence guiding company content moderation.

It’s not only about the companies. Governments must be transparent about their demands. Whether you are in Kashmir or Turkey or Egypt or other repressive environments, too often governments demand that companies take down content or ban accounts without public disclosure or reasoning. Companies, moreover, should not be expected to censor content in the absence of court orders subject to due process.

Third, we need global standards for global platforms, not the discretionary terms of service or some imagined version of the First Amendment. Human rights law provides the right set of guarantees for free expression, privacy, nondiscrimination, and due process.

Human rights standards protect all sorts of speech, but they do not require free-fire zones of disinformation, hatred, and harassment. They envision narrowly drawn restrictions when it is necessary to protect legitimate interests, such as the rights of others (to safety, security, privacy), or to safeguard public order. And they are binding on governments and intelligible to the public worldwide.

They would justify taking action against anti-vaccination sites that harm public health, white supremacists who incite harm of others, and terrorist groups like ISIS that use platforms to extend their violence. But they would also be strong justification for platforms to use against governments seeking to limit online speech.

None of this will work without public engagement and accountability. Criminal law, which governments like Singapore have adopted, is the wrong way to attack the problem of the platforms.

The companies must invest not just in thousands of content censors around the world but in engaging with communities worldwide, localizing their understanding of the role they play, giving communities ownership of online space. One idea, proposed by the global free speech organization Article 19, proposes nongovernmental “social media councils” to ensure public accountability for online speech rule-making.

These problems are global. They cannot be solved by Washington or European capitals—or by Silicon Valley—acting alone. The future of free speech depends on it.

By now, you’ve no doubt come across a thousand endorsements preaching the gospel of the Baby Foot peel, a pair of booties that slather your feet in a gel concoction designed to loosen dry and cracked skin. About a week later, the skin begins to fall from your feet in giant sheets, revealing the foot of a baby that was hiding underneath. It’s basically a chemical peel for your feet, and I love it — but I don’t use it on the regular, as it makes even the skin on the tops of my feet and my ankles peel. I’m more interested in removing the calluses that build up on my feet from walking everywhere I go, and getting relief from the intense dryness that is a direct result of wearing sandals and exposing my feet to dry air all summer long.

I’ve bought and tried almost every foot cream, and I’ve always found them a bit greasy and lacking in enough moisture to really kill the dry, ashy bits at the ends of my toes and on my heels. But then I was idly browsing at my favorite beauty shop in Little Tokyo where, lo and behold, sat this lone tube of foot cream made by the same manufacturer of the beloved Baby Foot peel kit. I snapped it up even though I couldn’t read a word of the instructions (it’s a Japan-only product, but of course some enterprising individual has made it available on Amazon). I figured it was foot cream, so what could go wrong?

Not only did nothing go wrong, it was better than I could have dreamed. Where most foot lotions are greasy for a good half-hour after applying (making it dangerous to walk around the house, and also a pain to put on shoes and head out the door), the Baby Foot Deep Moist Shea Butter goes on dry, but somehow moisturizes flawlessly. I’m pretty sure they mean for it to be used after performing the classic Baby Foot peel, but I’ve been using it as a stand-alone foot cream for a few weeks, and it blows any other foot cream I’ve previously used out of the water. The dry texture is a little disconcerting on your hands, so I use a butter knife to apply it (sorry, anyone I’ve invited over for dinner recently), then rub my feet together to get it into every nook and cranny. The weird callus I’ve always had on my baby toe is noticeably softer, and I don’t have those weird dry patches at the ends of my toes by midday anymore. It dries instantly, so I can apply it right before I throw on my shoes and race out the door, never worrying that my feet are slipping and sliding around like they do with other, greasier foot creams I’ve tried. I may not be able to read a word of what the tube says — but the results don’t lie.

More Strat-approved foot smoothers

Gehwol Fusskraft Blue Foot Cream

We did a very involved guide to taking care of your feet a few years back that’s still full of great nuggets. According to master pedicurist Lia Schorr, this is the ultimate foot cream: “This cream is natural and full of herbs. It has a strong medicinal aroma but will hydrate your feet, leaving them lovely and silky.”

ProLinc Callus Eliminator

Freer also told us about her pedicurist’s foot secret — the ProLinc Callus Eliminator. Here’s how to use it: “Soak your feet in a tub of warm water for five minutes. (I use this inflatable tub because it’s so easy to break down and store in between uses.) Apply a thin coating of ProLinc Callus Eliminator to your rough, callused foot parts, using a paper towel (you can also just use your hands, but make sure to wash them immediately afterward). Wait three to five minutes (no longer, as it could start to burn), then wipe any excess product off your foot with a tissue. Finally, it’s scraping time. I like using a pedicure-specific microplane rasp (though an old-school Mr. Pumice stone works well, too) and go to town. You’ll be shocked at how easily your calluses are turned to dust.”

CeraVe Renewing SA Cream

Beauty writer Hannah Morrill introduced us to this dermatologist-recommended cream that moisturizes while exfoliating during Feet Week last year. It also happened to be one of our best sellers of 2017: “The best contender I’ve found for this job? CeraVe Renewing SA Cream, which itself was developed with dermatologists and contains both exfoliant salicylic acid (that’s what the SA stands for) and ammonium lactate in the first ten ingredients, meaning the concentrations are significant, not an afterthought.”

Tweezerman LTD Pedro Callus Stone

Trust Kimbra Hickey — she’s a foot model. She told us about the best way she keeps her own money-makers looking camera-ready: “I exfoliate daily. This sugar scrub is grainy but not too harsh, and the ceramic stone is small, covered, and easy to travel with.”","Even that weird callus on my baby toe is softer.

55,$2 a day? Inside the fight to define extreme poverty in America.,Jordan Weissmann,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by NeONBRAND on Unsplash and Jeremy Yap on Unsplash.

The idea that many Americans might be living on less than $2 a day once sounded almost impossible; that was supposed to be what poverty meant in the developing world, not a rich nation like the United States. But in a wildly influential 2013 study, two sociologists upended that assumption: Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer showed that by 2011, there were 1.6 million U.S. households with children that, for at least part of the year, had cash incomes that put them below the $2 per person mark. The number had risen from 636,000 in 1996—a 152.9 percent increase.

Edin and Shaefer later turned their paper into an acclaimed book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing In America, that documented the lives of families mired in this kind of extreme poverty. In a New York Times review, the famed sociologist William Julius Wilson called it “essential” and a “call to action.” Their work inspired follow-on research by Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton. Bernie Sanders took to quoting them on the campaign trail.

The pair’s findings on the growth of extreme poverty also became an important data point in the argument over the legacy of welfare reform. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton teamed up with Republicans in Congress to end the federal government’s old, often vilified program that gave cash directly to poor families. They replaced it with a system designed to make unemployed parents go to work. Edin, today a professor at Princeton, and Shaefer, a professor at the University of Michigan, argued that this change destroyed a key part of the cash safety net, fueling the rise of $2-a-day destitution.

Were they right? Edin and Shaefer’s eye-popping results have always been somewhat controversial, with critics—typically on the political right—arguing that they’re mostly a statistical illusion created by bad data. The debate has gone on for years in the pages of academic journals and white papers, with Edin and Shaefer countering detractors and refining their findings along the way. This week, though, a group of rival researchers released the most serious challenge to their work yet. Their paper uses newly available data to essentially double check and correct the government survey results Edin and Shaefer relied on. And, after all of their adjustments, $2-a-day poverty nearly disappears.

It’s a convincing critique. But even as it makes a strong case that Edin and Shaefer’s most famous stats aren’t reliable, in some ways, the new study also supports the broader point of their book: The modern safety net seems to be fundamentally failing many families in America.

The U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be living in “deep” poverty if their income drops below half the official poverty line—about $10,100 or less for a family of three last year. Edin and Shaefer chose to look at $2-a-day poverty in their research instead, because they sensed some families were suffering from even more crushing deprivation. Edin had spent her career studying the financial lives of the very poor—in the 1990s she carefully documented how mothers on welfare stayed afloat. While doing field work in 2010, she noticed that there seemed to be a growing number of shockingly impoverished households with no source of cash income at all. “These families weren’t just poor by American standards,” she and Shaefer wrote in their book. “They were the poorest of the poor.” The fact that they specifically lacked cash was important: Many parents might have received SNAP benefits, aka food stamps, that helped them put meals on the table. But that wouldn’t help them pay for gas to get to work or let them buy clothes for their children.

When Edin mentioned her observations to Shaefer, he decided to see if he could spot the trend of growing cashlessness in government data. But first, “he needed to determine what income threshold would capture people who were experiencing a level of destitution so deep as to be unthought-of in America.” He settled on $2 per person per day, the benchmark the World Bank had long used to delineate poverty in the developing world.

This did, in fact, lead to some previously unthinkable results. In their original paper, Edin and Shaefer found that in 1996, the year Clinton signed his welfare reform bill into law, 1.7 percent of U.S. households with children were subsisting on $2 per person per day or less of cash income for at least part of the year. By 2011, the share had swelled to 4.3 percent. Even when they counted government benefits that were similar to cash—meaning SNAP, housing assistance, and refundable tax credits—as income, the share of families experiencing $2-a-day poverty still rose, albeit more modestly, from 1.1 percent in 1996 to 1.6 percent in 2011. Cashless poverty really did seem to be on the rise.

Now, these households were not experiencing the conditions of a Nigerian village or a Mumbai slum. But without dollars to spend, they were scraping the very bleak bottom of American life. In their book, published in 2015, Edin and Shaefer introduced readers to young adults who sold their own plasma to survive and flitted in and out of homelessness. “Rae moved in with her friend Danielle, herself a mother of three, and a group of other childhood friends who were sharing a house on a street where virtually every other property was burned-out,” they wrote of one single mother, who, by her 20s, had managed to lose all of her teeth. “When the water and power were shut off in that house and a woman was raped in the abandoned garage next door, she decided it wasn’t a safe place to raise a child.”

This all fed into an emerging narrative about how Clinton’s welfare reform may have hurt some of America’s most vulnerable. Studies suggested that while the legislation may have helped reduce overall poverty a bit by nudging many single mothers into the workforce, the decision to cut some families off from a monthly check seemed to have increased the number of Americans living in deep poverty. By showing that $2-a-day poverty rose after 1996, Edin and Shaefer’s research added to the evidence that ending welfare as we knew it had left more Americans in truly dire need.

Their work got attention. It also got pushback: Critics started questioning the data they were working from.

Most of our statistics on poverty come from surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. The kink in this system is that when the government asks, the very poorest Americans don’t always give accurate answers about their finances. They may forget that they receive SNAP benefits, or mix them up with another program. They might neglect to mention the extra money they make working odd jobs. The upshot of all this underreporting is that some people at the very bottom of the economic ladder may look worse off in the official numbers than they are in real life.

This is a well-known issue. Edin and Shaefer tried to address it in their initial research by basing their analysis on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, or SIPP, which appeared to have less of a problem with underreporting than other datasets. They also pointed to other signs of extreme hardship that seemed to buttress their results, such as the growing number of SNAP recipients reporting zero income, or the growing ranks of homeless children in public schools. More recently, they’ve produced analysis showing that if you accounted for underreporting of benefits using commonly accepted techniques pioneered by the Urban Institute, $2 poverty still seemed to have grown.

But critics have continued to suggest that their viral stat—that the share of families experiencing $2-a-day poverty grew by more than 150 percent after welfare reform—is really a product of the poor failing to report all of their income and government benefits. And the new paper makes the most persuasive case I’ve seen yet. It’s authored by a team led by Bruce Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. Meyer is an expert on poverty data who is known for his pioneering research on underreporting in federal surveys. Because of this focus, his work tends to be embraced by conservatives, including the Trump administration’s economic team, but he is widely respected in his field.

Here’s what makes Meyer’s new draft paper, which he conducted with the Census Bureau, so attention grabbing. It cross-checks the responses Americans gave when they participated in SIPP—the survey Edin and Shaefer relied on—in 2011, against the government’s actual administrative records showing what those same people earned and the federal benefits they received. Essentially, Meyer and his colleagues use Social Security Administration and IRS data, among other sources, to fact-check people’s descriptions of their own financial lives.

What they find is that, for the most part, Americans who reported living on $2 a day of income or less seemed to have more resources at their disposal than they let on. Correcting their earnings to match the Social Security Administration’s records alone lifts 55 percent of them above the $2 level; it lifts 38 percent of them out of deep poverty; and it lifts a quarter of them out of poverty altogether. Add in Social Security benefits, other income reflected in their tax files, housing assistance, and SNAP, and nearly 80 percent make it out of $2-a-day poverty.

Bruce Meyer

One frustrating thing about the paper is that, when it looks at families with children, it doesn’t define “income” in the same way Shaefer and Edin did, making its results slightly less reliable as a comparison. Whereas Edin and Shaefer analyzed how many parents were $2 poor if you only looked at their cash income and also analyzed how many were poor if you looked at their cash income as well as food stamps and some other government benefits, Meyer and his team always count the food stamps and other in-kind benefits as income. This makes it possible for Meyer to reduce the $2-a-day poverty rate to zero for parents. Using this approach with all Americans, they conclude the real rate is 0.24 percent, or about 285,000 households, most of which are single, childless adults.

Bruce Meyer

There is another important difference in how Meyer and his team define the poor in their study. Specifically, researchers don’t consider any household to be in extreme poverty if they have significant assets (the fifth row on the chart above), such as $5,000 in liquid savings or $25,000 in home equity. That’s not unreasonable—after all, it’s hard to argue someone is living on $2 a day if they have significant money in the bank—but it makes it difficult to make an exact apples-to-apples comparison with Edin and Shaefer’s findings, which ignored savings.

Either way, the paper sharply undercuts the idea that $2-a-day poverty rose because of welfare reform. If there were virtually no $2-a-day poor families in 2011, their numbers couldn’t have increased much since 1996, since there just aren’t that many of them. (Meyer and his team ran a similar exercise using $4-a-day poverty as their benchmark, and came to similar conclusions.) At the very least, it makes the case that the data Edin and Shaefer relied on had serious shortcomings that make it difficult to draw hard conclusions about the poorest of the poor. In their 2015 book, the two authors argued that the mere fact that a rising number of families were claiming to be living without cash was a cause for concern. But given how much income government surveys seem to miss, it’s at best a guess whether that increase is a sign that the poor have less money, or they’re just reporting having less money over time. (Meyer has shown that underreporting of government benefits has gotten significantly worse over time, but the trend is less clear with income.)

One upshot of all this is that Clinton’s welfare reform may have done less to harm the poorest of the poor than many commentators, myself included, previously thought. That’s not a definite conclusion: It’s possible that other studies showing that deep poverty rose after the law passed are still correct. But the evidence that the 1996 bill led to serious hardship is weaker than before.

Meyer’s new paper is consistent with a different story, supported by other recent research: As the old cash welfare program disappeared, other parts of the safety net, most importantly food stamps, have stepped in and helped keep truly extreme poverty from growing. That should be a cautionary tale for conservatives who would like to reform other parts of the welfare state, like food stamps, by adding stricter limits and work requirements. The story here is that these parts provide essential help.

It’s also important to keep in mind a caveat about Meyer’s paper. Just because $2-a-day poverty might be a statistical artifact, that does not mean there aren’t a large number of families in truly dire circumstances in this country. Meyer and his team themselves write that while their “paper demonstrates that the rate of extreme poverty in the United States is substantially lower than what has been reported, we do not contend that there is little deprivation in the United States.” Their paper also may miss some of the worst cases of need; it excludes homeless people, for instance, who don’t show up in government surveys. Meanwhile, the Department of Education believes 1.35 million public school children lack homes.

In some ways, it even confirms that Edin and Shaefer were on the right track when they argued that families without cash ready at hand are prone to special suffering. Meyer still finds that the roughly 1 million households lifted out of extreme poverty by benefits like food stamps—a group that includes most parents reporting $2-a-day incomes—suffer material hardships at much, much higher rates than the normal poor. They’re more likely to miss a rent payment or a bill, to have their power or phone service cut off, or to have difficulty getting enough to eat. There are many people who get some help from the government but still say they don’t have enough cash to live on. The safety net doesn’t seem to be doing enough to catch all of them—even if their suffering isn’t captured neatly in a viral stat.","And, after all of their adjustments, $2-a-day poverty nearly disappears.

60,Trump Gives World’s Worst Economist the Presidential Medal of Freedom,Jordan Weissmann,"Art Laffer speaks about the economy during a panel discussion at the Heritage Foundation in 2014. Saul Loeb/Getty Images

There may be no man alive who has done more damage to America’s understanding of economics than Art Laffer. So, of course, Donald Trump is now awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The White House press release calls Laffer the “father of supply-side economics,” the conservative doctrine that emphasizes growth through tax cuts. First, he’s not really the father of this movement. Its original intellectual force was economist Robert Mundell, a quirky Nobel prize winner under whom Laffer studied. Laffer did go on to become the idea’s most important preacher and popularizer, though. He’s best known for observing that if the government raises taxes too high, it will eventually collect less revenue, because people will begin to work and earn less. Thus, in some circumstances, tax cuts could theoretically pay for themselves by spurring the economy. He wasn’t actually the first person to notice this, but no matter. One night at dinner in 1974, he illustrated the point to Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld by drawing a curve on a napkin—which is why we now call the concept the Laffer curve.

The Laffer curve is a somewhat useful observation. Most economists agree that there is a point of diminishing returns where raising taxes becomes counterproductive. But to reach it, you probably have to push rates really, really high—possibly to somewhere around 70 percent. Laffer has instead spent years preaching the idea that almost any tax cut for businesses and the rich could potentially pay for itself, an intellectually corrosive notion that has now become the conceptual backbone of the Republican Party’s entire economic program. Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin insisted the administration’s own tax cut would cover its own cost (Laffer , who advised Trump’s campaign in 2016, himself said the cut to the corporate rate would pay for itself “many times over.”) Mitch McConnell said much the same. Predictably, it wasn’t true.

Spreading the idea that tax cuts are self-financing wasn’t Laffer’s only sin against economics. He’s been personally involved in some disastrous public policy experiments, such as the notorious Kansas tax plan that wrecked the state’s finances. And recently, he and his longtime friend Stephen Moore, the conservative pundit Donald Trump nearly nominated to the Fed, co-wrote Trumponomics, a book-length tribute to the administration’s policies. Now he’s getting a medal for his services.","So, of course, Donald Trump is now awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Nobody is happy about Donald Trump’s new threat to slap tariffs on Mexico unless it clamps down on migrants crossing the border. Well, almost nobody.

Investors? They’re panicking. Stocks are down. So are treasury yields, which is a sign that folks are worried and fleeing to safe assets. Mexico? What do you think? Republicans in Congress? Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley says the move is a “misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent.” The business lobby? It’s peeved. Trump’s own advisers? Some of them are reportedly furious. Specifically, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, a free trader, and U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer, known for his protectionist streak, are both apparently opposed.

So who’s pleased? Presumably Stephen Miller, the spiritual keeper of this administration’s anti-immigrant flame. Like many of the Trump administration’s worst ideas, CNBC reports this Mexico one belonged to him. He apparently sprang the plan while Vice President Mike Pence was traveling and Larry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser and another free trade advocate, was busy having surgery. It seems the adults went away for the week and Miller decided to throw a xenophobic rager that might sink the economy.

Up until very recently, I haven’t been too worried about the effect of Trump’s trade war on growth. Yes, his tariffs on China are a rather large tax on American businesses and consumers. But they’ve only slowed the economy a bit so far. Beijing’s retaliation has made life complicated for farmers, but they’re getting bailed out.

Now, though, I’m starting to feel anxious. Trump announced that on June 10, he plans to place a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods and leave it there “until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP.” According to the White House, the rate will rise to 10 percent by July 1 “if the crisis persists”—whatever the heck that means—then keep ratcheting up to 25 percent, unless the border situation is somehow resolved to the administration’s liking.

This could all be extremely disruptive to the U.S. economy—especially the auto industry, which relies on the ability to move cars and parts seamlessly and tariff-free back and forth across the southern border. Forget the cost of avocados and tomatoes: Trump is basically threatening to throw a bomb at GM and Ford’s North American supply chains.

It’s not clear he sees that as a bad thing. Some have wondered if this is just a bit of bluster; migration through Mexico tends to tail off in the summer, so it’s possible that Trump could make his tariff threat then declare victory based on that seasonal decline. But Trump also really seems to like imposing tariffs just for the sake of imposing tariffs, and while this move might risk blowing up the new version of NAFTA he negotiated, that deal was already stalling in Congress, so he might not be overly worried about that. Meanwhile, the president is tweeting about companies leaving Mexico.

In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2019

It’s not just the Mexico tariffs themselves that have me worried, though. It’s the cumulative effect of everything Trump is up to at the moment, and his timing. He’s already placed 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and as both sides of that conflict have dug in, he’s threatened to do the same on the remaining $300 billion of the country’s U.S. exports. Growth in U.S. business investment, meanwhile, was weak during the first quarter, and the U.S. Treasury yield curve was already inverted, which reliably tends to happen prior to a recession, and at least signals that investors are feeling pessimistic about growth. Oil prices have been taking a hit thanks to fears about global growth and demand, which, while good for drivers, could lead to further cutbacks on business investment by U.S. drillers.

It’s not hard to imagine us hitting a tipping point soon. Trump places his tariffs on our third largest trading partner, markets freak further, executives dial back their plans for investment—after all, nobody knows what the heck the global supply chain is going to look like—the auto industry staggers, and under the weight of it all, growth grinds to a crawl.

I’m not saying everything will necessarily go down that way. But I am saying the administration is on the verge of taking all the steps necessary to sabotage its own economy, all to keep desperate central American migrants from trying to claim asylum. Stephen Miller’s racism might just cause a recession.","Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesNobody is happy about Donald Trump’s new threat to slap tariffs on Mexico unless it clamps down on migrants crossing the border.

62,Health care reform efforts in Connecticut and Washington show just how hard this will be.,Jordan Weissmann,"Protesters supporting “Medicare for All” hold a rally outside PhRMA headquarters on April 29 in D.C. Win McNamee/Getty Images

Since 2016, the conversation about health care on the left has focused on big, sweeping reforms. On the internet, you either support “Medicare for All” or you’re a neoliberal sellout. On the campaign trail, presidential candidates are talking about ideas that were once considered too radical to pass Congress, like a public option, as prudent compromises.

Two news stories out of Washington and Connecticut this month are a reminder that, back in the real world, eking out even incremental progress on health care is very, very difficult. In both states, Democratic lawmakers sought to create what might be called sorta public options—government-designed health plans that private insurers would sell to individuals and small businesses. In Washington, the effort succeeded, but only after politicians made a major tweak to appease hospitals that will make the coverage more expensive. In Connecticut, meanwhile, the attempt flamed out in an episode that may foreshadow just how hard large insurers will fight even small-bore attempts at reform.

Let’s start on the West Coast. On May 13, Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that will let residents in Washington buy a state health plan called Cascade Care, starting in 2021. Under the program, the government will craft the benefits package, then contract with private insurers to sell it.

Inslee, who is making a dark horse bid for the White House, has touted Cascade Care as the country’s first “public option.” That’s stretching things a bit; when experts use that term, they usually mean a health plan where the government is responsible for both setting benefits and covering the cost of claims. Washington won’t do the latter—the private insurers will take on all the financial risk and reap the profits—and the state isn’t offering any subsidies beyond what the Affordable Care Act provides (though the law requires the state to study the possibility of doing so in the future). Insurance companies won’t be required to offer Cascade Care either, and providers won’t be forced to accept it.

If that sounds like a tentative step into the world of government-backed insurance, well, that’s because it is. “We wanted to try and develop something that we could do within current law and would not require some major outlay from the state, because we don’t have that kind of money,” Jason McGill, a health policy adviser to Inslee, told me. The near-term hope, McGill explained to me, is that if the state works with carriers to offer a standard, low-cost health plan, hospitals will feel obligated to accept it.

But because Democrats didn’t want to force hospitals to accept the new insurance plan, they had to make other concessions as well. Originally, lawmakers had wanted the program to save more money by limiting Cascade Care’s payments to providers at exactly the Medicare rate. That triggered “a lot of pushback” from the medical community, Mary Clogston, a senior policy aide for the state’s House Democratic Caucus, told me. There were concerns that unless they raised the cap, no hospitals would accept the insurance in some parts of the state, or other providers would try to make up for the low payments by charging more to patients who get coverage from their employer.

In the end, legislators settled on payments that were moderately lower than the rates private insurers currently offer providers in the state but more than what Medicare pays. The goal is to offer coverage up to 10 percent cheaper than other options on the state’s Obamacare exchange, but that’s not a guarantee, and it won’t change the insurance market overnight. “Cutting costs is hard,” Clogston said.

Whatever Cascade Care’s limitations might be, the new law is still a victory for health reformers who would like to see a larger role for government in offering coverage. In Connecticut this week, the reformers were less lucky. There, one of the nation’s largest insurers scuttled a proposal to create a public option similar to Washington’s, which had been supported by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont and the state’s Democratic legislators.

Exactly what happened in Connecticut is a bit murky. One of the public option’s key proponents, state Comptroller Kevin Lembo, declared the proposal dead on Wednesday afternoon in an interview with the Hartford Courant and blamed Cigna CEO David Cordani for killing it. According to Lembo, Cordani had said that if lawmakers went ahead with the bill, his company would release a letter threatening to move its headquarters out of the state. A Cigna spokesman denied that claim and told the Courant that the carrier had only lobbied against the bill, not issued a threat. But Connecticut state Sen. Matt Lesser, another supporter of the legislation, told me Cigna had in fact made the same threat to him during a phone call. “It’s just sort of stunning to me,” he said.

What makes this incident especially shocking is that even though Cigna is based in Connecticut, the company doesn’t sell any coverage on the state’s individual or small group markets. In other words, its business would have been totally unaffected by the bill. The company simply seemed to be opposed to any additional government role in the private market. “They had nothing at stake except the principle of the thing,” Lesser told me. “The idea that the state would get involved in market-setting seemed like a step on the road to socialism.”

According to Lesser, other insurers in Connecticut were interested in negotiating details of the new public option, rather than derailing it entirely. But Cigna’s decision to, in his telling, squash the effort by using its heft as a major employer in the state shows that at least one of the country’s biggest carriers is willing to take a militant stand against anything that even resembles public health insurance. It’s not clear if the company could be as effective at intimidating politicians outside of Connecticut, where insurance is a key local industry. But Cordani, Cigna’s CEO, also chairs the board of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the sector’s top lobbying group. His views on these issues will likely carry plenty of weight whenever health care reform pops up again on Capitol Hill. We should all expect the fight to be brutal.","Win McNamee/Getty ImagesSince 2016, the conversation about health care on the left has focused on big, sweeping reforms.

63,The California housing crisis is a crime against the young by the old.,Henry Grabar,"Photo illustration by Slate. Images by Wiese_Harald/iStock/Getty Images Plus and SchulteProductions/iStock/Getty Images Plus.

The numbers in California tell a dire story these days: In 2018, despite low unemployment and high wages, the state’s population grew at its slowest rate in history. Fewer people are coming and more people are leaving because it’s very hard to find a place to live. In the past two years, homelessness is up 17 percent in San Francisco and 43 percent in Oakland’s Alameda County. Counties in Silicon Valley and the Inland Empire also recorded double-digit homelessness increases. Compared with the national figures, the state’s home prices are 2.5 times above average, while rents are 50 percent above average. “While many factors have a role in driving California’s high housing costs,” the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst’s Office concludes, “the most important is the significant shortage of housing, particularly within coastal communities.”

How many people must live in the street before we can build new homes?

More was the answer earlier this month from the California State Senate, which punted—again—on a popular, radical solution to end the state’s debilitating housing shortage. Right now, apartment buildings are banned in most of California. By allowing them near mass transit, SB 50 would have increased California’s feasible annual housing output by a factor of six. But that would have changed the character of many neighborhoods with bus routes, according to state Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat from the L.A. suburbs who last week halted the legislation’s progress to maintain the status quo of single-family zoning. “It was the time to take a breath, and we took a breath,” he said. Portantino is the former mayor of a town that has not built an apartment in a decade, one where the median home sells for $1.6 million. A breath or three.

In a letter to the Los Angeles Times, Mar Vista resident Glenn Zweifel summed up a view that has pervaded meetings and online discussions on the subject: “I have always maintained that there is not necessarily a shortage of housing but an excess of people. Just because you want to live somewhere doesn’t mean you can.” In short, California is full.

In the New York Times, Farhad Manjoo writes that “this sort of nakedly exclusionary urban restrictionism is a particular shame of the left.” Manjoo and many others blame wealthy liberals for throwing up the gates—not just in California, but in other high-cost cities and suburbs as well.

Apartment bans are a case of rich vs. poor, longtime resident vs. newcomer, and, all too often, white vs. black, but they are something else too: generational warfare, a showdown in which older homeowners are telling younger renters that there’s no more room. Seen that way, the housing affordability crisis serves as a useful framework for understanding a handful of urgent American issues that have stalled out, particularly intraparty conflicts on the left like those over student debt and climate change. Whether by intention or simply in effect, it has begun to feel like the politics of an older generation saying, “Fuck you, I got mine.”

American gerontocracy has levels. There is the president, who has not processed new information since 1990. There is Congress, which has an average age of 58 in the House and 63 in the Senate—among the oldest group of legislators in U.S. history. There has until recently been an enormous age gap in voter participation, and a familiar divide between older and younger Americans on issues like race, immigration, religion, and America’s place in the world. It all adds up to two different ideas of the country.

But there is a parallel struggle at work, driven not by competing ideologies but by older Americans’ apparent indifference to the challenges facing their younger counterparts. In principle, at least, everyone basically agrees that housing and college should be affordable and that the air and water should be clean. But older Americans have already enjoyed an affordable college education, a choice of affordable neighborhoods, skies full of monarch butterflies, and oceans with fish living in them. So when it comes to addressing the fact that reality has changed—that housing near good jobs is no longer affordable, that going to college now entails decades of debt, that Miami will be underwater in 30 years—their resistance to address the changing reality reads as a collective shrug of self-interest. I got mine.

For most of the 20th century, America been run by elder statesmen, with the average representative now 20 years older than the median resident. What’s changed is that for once, things are not getting better with each passing generation. Even on the left, our elected officials don’t seem to quite get it. One sign of their disinterest is the continued inaction in Washington, in statehouses, and at the polls on issues like housing affordability, college costs, and climate change. But sometimes they are more explicit, as Joe Biden was when he said he has “no empathy” for millennials talking about how tough things are. Biden’s presidential campaign has the support of almost half of Democrats over 45, four times the support of his closest opponent.

Let’s review how things have changed for young Americans since the wunderkind from Delaware became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history in 1973. The median income for young men is lower now than it was then. Average net worth for young households in 2016 is 20 percent lower than it was for boomers in 1989 and 40 percent lower than for Gen X families in 2001.

Relatedly, the cost of getting a college education more than doubled between 1985 and 2015. Student loan debt is approaching $1.5 trillion—up from $90 billion in 1999, a 1,500 percent increase. While some Democratic candidates are proposing versions of a debt jubilee, for the moment, the best young Americans can hope for is the largesse of random billionaires or debt forgiveness from a hamburger chain sweepstakes.

On housing, the ratio of median home price to median income—the years of salary it takes to buy a home—is 4.2, a full point higher than it was in 1988. In the nation’s best job markets, the barriers are higher still: Miami’s price-to-income ratios are up from 2.9 to 6.3 since 1980; Denver’s are up from 2.7 to 5.5; Seattle’s are up from 2.5 to 5.7. In wealthy cities and suburbs, (mostly older, mostly white) homeowners have successfully made housing the investment of a lifetime—their lifetime. Not coincidentally, the share of home equity owned by Americans over 60 has risen 17 percentage points between 2006 and 2018. That’s in part because we are building fewer homes per capita than at any time since World War II, a situation that seems unlikely to change anytime soon.

Nowhere is this tendency of older Americans to shrug off a crisis more pronounced than in their reluctance to address the climate change crisis they helped create. Unlike Republicans, however (where there is a big generation gap over the issue), older and younger Democrats basically agree that climate change is man-made and affecting the United States.

When it comes to dealing with it, though, it’s a different story. Biden, the avatar of that older cohort in the Democratic primary, is reportedly seeking a “middle ground” approach to addressing climate change. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have also urged a moderate approach. That lack of urgency has angered younger climate activists, who will bear the worst effects of the crisis.

In April, a Harvard Institute of Politics survey asked voters in their 20s to evaluate whether various groups “care about people like me.” Boomers as a group scored lower than the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and Donald Trump.

Of course, it’s unfair to judge all Americans over 55 by the incompetence of our wizened legislatures: Many older Americans do get it. Many have been sounding the alarm about climate change for decades. The leading voices of progressive federal policy on the campaign trail are Bernie Sanders (77) and Elizabeth Warren (69), and the best climate policy belongs to Jay Inslee, who is 68.

It’s also true that inaction on housing and climate harms older people too. The affordability crisis is in some ways hardest on the elderly, and the lack of diverse housing options makes it impossible for even well-off seniors to downsize in their own neighborhoods. Older Americans are also more vulnerable to the extreme weather associated with climate change. And in the largest possible sense, the inability of younger Americans to secure long-term financial stability is bad news for everyone.

To solve this problem, younger people need to keep voting like they did in 2018—when, for the first time, Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z cast more votes than boomers and older generations, with millennial turnout doubling from 2014. It doesn’t feel like an accident that the youngest woman ever elected to Congress has done more to advance climate change discourse in Washington in six months than Democrats have done in a decade. But they can also try to make the case—in community meetings, in statehouses, and in Washington—for empathy. Young people in college, at planning meetings in Palo Alto, or protesting in Dianne Feinstein’s office, aren’t asking for anything radical—just for what their parents and grandparents already had.","Let’s review how things have changed for young Americans since the wunderkind from Delaware became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history in 1973.

So, the dark elves who run the Republican Party’s official Twitter account decided to tweet about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign plans. See if you can spot the problem.

Elizabeth Warren plans to give the gov't control of education, health care, & jobs. Her solution to pay for it:

—Raise taxes to cancel student debt

—Raise taxes to fund gov't-run health care

—Raise taxes to increase min. wage



Everyday Americans can't afford Warren's agenda. — GOP (@GOP) June 6, 2019

Raise taxes to increase the minimum wage? That … that is not how anything works. Anywhere. I mean, maybe in some hyperattenuated philosophical sense—a pay increase at McDonald’s might make your Big Mac more expensive, which is kind of like a tax hike if you squint at it in the right light, perhaps after a few glasses of wine and a puff on whatever is in your vape pen. But raising the minimum wage does not actually require taxing anybody. Certainly not everyday Americans. You could raise taxes to increase wage subsidies, like the earned income tax credit. But the minimum wage is literally just a minimum wage. The IRS is not involved.

I am not the first person to notice this tweet. People have been mocking it at least since 11:14 p.m. last night. Yet it is still up. More than 5,000 people have liked it. And so I am left with questions. Are there actually living, breathing Republicans who believe the minimum wage is a tax hike? Are Republicans test-running some new anti–minimum wage messaging, where they’re just going to Trumpishly flout observable reality and insist it involves a tax increas? Does anybody at GOP social media HQ actually read the things they write?

In related news, Tucker Carlson of all people is now saying nice things about Warren’s “economic nationalism” agenda, which he says sounds like “Trump at his best,” and maybe tells you something about the broad appeal of her ideas. Perhaps the GOP should stop offering her free advertising? If they keep at it, their voters might recognize something they like.","An elephant sometimes forgets how the minimum wage works.

65,Who Will Replace Theresa May as Prime Minister?,Joshua Keating,"The contenders. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by STF/AFP/Getty Images and Chris McAndrew/Parliament.uk.

When Theresa May announced her resignation on May 24, the contest to replace her, which had been quietly going on for months, burst into the open. This isn’t a national election—given how the party is polling these days, no candidate would want that. It’s a contest to become leader of the Conservative Party and therefore prime minister.

May will officially step down as leader of the conservatives on Friday but will stay on as prime minister until her replacement is chosen. There are 11 declared candidates, and a few more may still jump in. They have until Monday to decide whether to run. Conservative members of parliament will then whittle these down in a series of votes until there are just two. Then, the party membership will choose between those two. The party wants to have the whole thing wrapped up by late July, when Parliament will go on recess. Meanwhile, the clock is still ticking down to Oct. 31, the current deadline on which Britain is due to exit the EU. (It’s now been extended twice.)

The candidates have a wide variety of proposals on Brexit, ranging from asking for an extension to calling a new referendum to just saying, To hell with it, and leaving the EU without a deal. And there are still some non-Brexit political issues to consider as well. Like a fun house–mirror version of the U.S. Democratic primary, the field is a diverse group with some strong personalities as well as a lot of indistinguishable white guys.

Here’s a look at the currently declared contenders, grouped by their degree of Brexitiness. Odds are from the betting house Ladbrokes as of Wednesday.

Extremely Brexity

Boris Johnson

﻿Odds: 4-5

Most recent job: foreign minister

Trump on the Thames? The voluble, mop-topped journalist–turned–London mayor–turned–foreign minister, who got an endorsement from Donald Trump this week, is currently the front-runner, according to most pundits and betting markets. He says he will try to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU before Oct. 31 but will pull Britain out of the EU on that date, with a deal or without one. As a leading campaigner for Leave during the original Brexit referendum who quit May’s Cabinet over disagreements about her withdrawal agreement, he is considered an arch Brexiteer, though his views on other social and economic issues are a bit more moderate than others in that camp. The case for Boris is that the party needs its own brash populist leader to push back against the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of the world. The case against him is that he’s a rank opportunist, willing to do or say anything to gain power, regardless of the consequences for the country. Johnson is extremely popular with the party rank-and-file, so he will almost certainly win if he makes it to the final two. Unfortunately for him, many of his colleagues hate him.

Andrea Leadsom

Odds: 8-1

Most recent job: leader of the House of Commons

Leadsom was the runner-up to Theresa May in 2016, the latest time the Tories had a leadership contest—she stumbled after making a controversial remark that having children gave her more of a stake in the country’s future than the childless May—and has thrown her hat into the ring again. The former investment banker has had a number of Cabinet positions in David Cameron’s and May’s governments. She stuck it out with May longer than most of the other Brexiteers but quit as leader of the House of Commons on May 22, just two days before May announced her own resignation. Leadsom might be the hardest Brexiteer of them all. She has declared May’s withdrawal agreement dead and isn’t even interested in renegotiating it. She instead favors a “managed no-deal” scenario in which Britain would seek a series of side agreements on key issues with Europe after leaving. The EU has said it’s not interested in making such deals, but Leadsom is still probably more realistic than anyone promising they can renegotiate everything by Oct. 31.

Dominic Raab

Odds: 20-1

Most recent job: Brexit secretary

Raab, who was theoretically overseeing May’s negotiations with the EU, quit in protest after May released her withdrawal agreement in November. (He confusingly later voted for it as an MP.) His current line on Brexit is similar to Johnson’s—he will try to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement but is prepared to leave without a deal if he can’t. He has gone further, however, by suggesting he would overrule Parliament to make a no-deal Brexit happen. Raab’s right-wing views—he favors cutting corporate tax rates and is open to privatizing some state-run schools—likely make him less palatable to Tory moderates than Johnson. He has created controversy in the past by saying food bank users are probably not “languishing in poverty” and has described feminists as “obnoxious bigots.”

Esther McVey

Odds: 100-1

Most recent job: secretary of state for work and pensions



The pro-Leave McVey quit May’s Cabinet at the same time as Raab and has seemingly angled for leadership since then, launching a Blue Collar Conservativism campaign group aimed at winning back working-class voters, complete with a pub tour. Her candidacy has been a little rough so far, though. She’s been mocked for suggesting there could be an “invisible border” between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. (This was a clumsy way of describing the vague “technological fixes” for the Irish border problem that are part of a lot of candidates Brexit plans.) She’s also faced backlash for defending the rights of parents to pull their kids out of classes that discuss LGBTQ relationships.

Somewhat Brexity

Michael Gove

Odds: 5-1

Current job: environment secretary

With the party deeply split over Brexit, Gove might end up being the ultimate compromise candidate. As justice secretary and a close ally of then–Prime Minister David Cameron, Gove was one of the most prominent Leave advocates along with Johnson ahead of the original referendum. But he quickly adopted a “softer” stance than most of his counterparts, and he stuck with May while nearly all the other prominent Brexiteers quit her Cabinet. Now, he reportedly says he’d be prepared to delay Brexit until 2020 in order to avoid a “no deal” and has pledged to allow EU citizens who lived in the U.K. before the referendum to apply for U.K. citizenship free of charge. For what it’s worth, Trump reportedly asked to meet with him, along with Johnson.

Jeremy Hunt

Odds: 8-1

Current job: foreign secretary

Of the candidates who were Remainers during the referendum—he was health secretary at the time—Hunt probably has the best chance of becoming prime minister. He now supports leaving the EU and says he will assemble a new negotiating team—including hard-line Brexiteers and leaders from Northern Ireland and Scotland—to get a better deal than May’s. He has said that backing a no-deal Brexit would be “political suicide” for his party but also that he would back it “with a heavy heart” if necessary. As foreign minister, he has been actively involved in talks to reach a cease-fire in Yemen but has faced criticism for defending British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

Sajid Javid

Odds: 33-1

Current job: home secretary

Javid was an extremely lukewarm Remainer during the referendum but is now thought of as a Brexiteer. He’s in the leave-on-Oct.-31-no-matter-what camp and advocates preparing for a no-deal. Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants who would be the U.K.’s first nonwhite prime minister, was considered a top-tier candidate early on, but his star has faded. He has recently defended the decision to strip the citizenship of a teenager who traveled to Syria to marry an ISIS fighter. In response to an increase in knife crime, he has called for more of a public health approach but has also backed giving police more stop-and-frisk powers. Apparently home secretary isn’t a job you take in the hopes of avoiding controversy.

Matt Hancock

Odds: 50-1

Current job: health secretary

Matt Hancock, who is a different person than Mark Harper, wants to get the U.K. out of the EU by Oct. 31 but is against a no-deal Brexit. He has a somewhat more detailed plan than his competitors, involving a comprehensive free-trade deal with Europe and forming an “Irish border council” to help resolve the status of the border. He’s been praised by the Guardian for having “the seemingly basic virtues of being apparently competent and broadly similar to a normal human being.” Good job, Matt.

Mark Harper

Odds: 100-1

Most recent job: minister for disabled people

Mark Harper, who is definitely not Matt Hancock, was not in the Cabinet during the time Brexit was negotiated. He stepped down as immigration minister in 2014 when it turned out his house cleaner did not have a valid visa, then served as disabilities minister for less than a year. He says this is an advantage, since, “I don’t think we should take the people who were responsible for where we got to now and assume they’ve got the solutions for how we move forward.” The former accountant backed Remain in 2016 and hasn’t ruled out no-deal but says he will ask for a “short, focused extension” past Oct. 31, calling proposals to negotiate a new deal before then unrealistic. They are unrealistic, but it seems like no one really wants to hear that right now.

Not very Brexity

Rory Stewart

Odds: 25-1

Current job: international development secretary

The former British foreign officer (and Slate contributor) is best known for his bestselling books describing his travels in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was given his first Cabinet role in May and almost immediately began campaigning for prime minister. He was a Remainer in 2016 who then became an enthusiastic public advocate (sometimes too enthusiastic) for May’s withdrawal agreement. He opposes a no-deal Brexit and has said he wouldn’t work under Johnson because of the latter’s stance on the issue. The young, eccentric Stewart has garnered some excitement with his social media–heavy campaign but is still considered a long shot. He’s often compared to Lawrence of Arabia for his youthful feats of derring-do, but these days he seems more like a British Mayor Pete.

Sam Gyimah

Odds: 200-1

Most recent job: universities minister

Gyimah, who on Sunday became the most recent candidate to join the race, is the only one openly backing a second referendum on Brexit and says he would vote to remain. Gyimah, a former investment banker who spent much of his childhood in his parents’ native Ghana, quit May’s Cabinet in November over objections to her Brexit plan. Given that much of the party is so opposed to a second referendum that May had to step down for even suggesting one, it seems unlikely Gyimah’s candidacy is going anywhere.","It’s a contest to become leader of the Conservative Party and therefore prime minister.

66,"Biden Changes Mind, Says He’s Now Against Decades-Old Ban on Federal Funding for Abortion",Elliot Hannon,"Joe Biden addresses his political evolution on the Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions at a DNC event on June 6, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. Dustin Chambers/Getty Images

Joe Biden is eyeing a run against President Trump that stakes out the political center of the electorate, but that means he’s often running to the right of the current Democratic field. On Thursday, however, Biden reversed course, veering left on an issue that is of increasing importance for Democratic voters, the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions. Biden has supported the measure, which dates back to 1976, throughout his political life, with his campaign reaffirming its support as recently as this week. Amidst growing pressure, however, Biden announced Thursday he had changed his mind on the issue, saying that “circumstances have changed.” “We’ve seen state after state including Georgia passing extreme laws,” Biden explained. “It’s clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of Roe.” Other Democrats in the 2020 field have called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment because it prohibited Medicaid funding of abortion, which disproportionately affected poor women and women of color.

Biden expounded on his change of heart Thursday evening during a DNC-hosted gala in Atlanta. “I’ve been working through the finer details of my health care plan like others in this race, and I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,” Biden said. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s ZIP code.” Biden cited the growth of anti-abortion laws in states, particularly in the deep south, that has made abortion procedures more and more difficult to access, while also setting up a potential Supreme Court challenge to Roe v. Wade. “Folks, times have changed,” Biden said. “I don’t think these guys are going to let up.”

“At a time where the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Roe are under attack, we need full-throated allies in our leaders,” Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights group Naral Pro-Choice America, said of Biden’s reversal. “We’re pleased that Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party’s core values—support for abortion rights, and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country.”

Biden, a Catholic, hasn’t always hewed to the Democratic party line on abortion rights, but times have indeed changed. The Democratic Party he hopes to lead has shifted to the left in the era of Trump while anti-abortion legislation has gained traction in state legislatures. That puts the issue front-and-center in the buildup to 2020 and Biden’s stance on the Hyde Amendment was a potential point of attack for Democratic challengers looking to paint the former VP as out of step with the current mood of the party. Biden will likely still have some convincing to do for many on the left, but maintained that he would make “no apologies for the last position.”","Joe Biden addresses his political evolution on the Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions at a DNC event on June 6, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.

67,"Hannity, Trump, and the Whole “Lock Her Up” Crew Are Absolutely Outraged at Pelosi’s Prosecution and Prison Comment",Elliot Hannon,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told Democratic leaders that she didn’t want to impeach President Donald Trump, something she has long been resistant to politically, but instead wanted to see him “in prison,” Politico reported earlier this week.* The comment was part of Pelosi’s greater argument that the best way to seek some modicum of justice when it comes to what appears to be criminal behavior by Trump outlined in the Mueller report is to wait until he’s out of office and no longer has presidential immunity to allow the legal system to run its course. It’s a strategic decision based on evidence that crimes appear to have been committed, namely obstruction of justice, among many potential others, that may ultimately be prosecutable. It’s also calculus that is largely deferential to Trump, as president, and relies on the now-quaint notion of the rule of law being used to redress past wrongs. Some Democrats don’t love Pelosi’s approach because they believe impeachment proceedings are the appropriate forum to address Trump’s apparent crimes. Fox News host Sean Hannity, on the other hand, was absolutely gobsmacked by Pelosi’s comments.

On his show Thursday night, Hannity oscillated between outrage and disbelief that Democrats might see a legitimate legal case for prosecuting Trump once out of office.

Hannity: Speaker Pelosi now apparently telling senior Democrats that she’d like to see Trump behind bars. Based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison? That happens in banana republics—beyond despicable behavior. And by the way, they would literally turn, in many ways, the USA into a country we no longer recognize.

Hmm … jailing political opponents, you say? Who on earth would suggest such an outrageous thing?

Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2016

My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 17, 2019

You get the idea.

Trump was actually asked about Pelosi’s comments and had typically Trump things to say. “I actually don’t think she’s a talented person,” Trump said. “I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would’ve liked to have gotten some deals done. She’s incapable of doing deals.”

I guess that counts as progress from the president.","Some Democrats don’t love Pelosi’s approach because they believe impeachment proceedings are the appropriate forum to address Trump’s apparent crimes.

73,How Did Mystery Writer Twitter Become Convinced This Debut Author Didn’t Exist?,Marissa Martinelli,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Alexey_M/Getty Images Plus.

The creators of Scarlet, a new suspense imprint aimed at a primarily female audience, weren’t planning to release any details about their first book this week. The imprint’s debut novel, An Inconvenient Woman, isn’t out until January, and they hadn’t even announced the title yet, let alone sent out any galleys. But rumors about the book—specifically, that its supposedly female author might secretly be a front for a man—were spreading quickly among mystery writers. One such writer, Lisa Brackmann, tweeted directly at Pegasus Books, Scarlet’s parent company, to get to the bottom of things: “I’m hearing some disturbing things. That the 1st two books from your ‘woman-focused’ Scarlet imprint are not only written by men, but that you are trying to disguise them as women by creating fake bios & online personas for them. Surely this can’t be true?”

Pegasus, which had teamed up with publisher Otto Penzler of the Mysterious Press on the project, decided to try to quell the rumors on Monday by revealing the first book’s title and the author’s name: Stephanie Buelens. “She is indeed a real person with a remarkable story to tell and we are excited to share interviews and event information closer to publication,” it wrote in response to Brackmann’s tweet. Still, even that information wasn’t enough to convince some skeptics (though it perhaps didn’t help that their initial tweet mistakenly identified her as “Stephanie Beulen” instead). Several remarked on Buelens’ apparent lack of social media presence or prior published work.

But is it written by a woman or a man? — James W. Ziskin (@Jameswziskin) June 4, 2019

Weird how they’re launching an imprint with a writer who has no previous novels or short stories that I can find. It’s almost like this might actually be someone else. — Paul J. Garth (@PauljGarth) June 3, 2019

Just a heads up, if it isn’t what you say it is, the #WritersCommunity will find out. Anything short of complete transparency will be a very bad look. — Patricia Smiley (@SmileyWriter) June 4, 2019

Writer and journalist Nick Kolakowski wrote, “Closest match is a voiceover artist whose Twitter feed went active May 30 and immediately started Tweeting stuff about crime fiction and Pegasus Books. But the LinkedIn matching the name/face says she’s some kind of French translator? It’s weird.” When Pegasus doubled down, he wrote, “We’ll see.”

Stephanie Buelens is not a work of fiction invented to sell mystery novels. I know this because she has an internet presence that goes back several years, and because I checked with her publisher, and, oh yeah, because she called me on the phone. She is, indeed, a French translator and teacher. She doesn’t have any previously published work because An Inconvenient Woman is her first. She co-wrote it with a friend, an established male writer who, according to Penzler, has published more than 20 books. That author wants to keep his name off the project to preserve his brand because, Penzler said, “he writes a very different kind of book.” As a result, Buelens is the sole author credited.

When we spoke on Tuesday, Buelens insisted that the story is her own and that her co-author’s contribution was mainly helping her with the language. “You can tell that I am French and that I need someone to correct and to put it in a better English,” she said. She’s originally from Belgium, where she’s been living for the past eight months to take care of her father. She moved to Paris when she was 19 and traveled back and forth between there and Los Angeles for years, but retains a strong French accent and has a tendency to scramble idioms. (The ruckus over her identity is “a tempest in a teacup”; her agent and her publisher are “not born from yesterday.”) She also tends to punctuate her sentences with an emphatic voila.

As for her apparent lack of social media presence? “I’m not good in social medias. I don’t know about Tweet-er, I don’t know about Instagram,” she said. She recently created a Facebook account, and while she isn’t sure about the Twitter profile that uses her name and photo, she thinks her publisher may have set it up for her. She is, however, definitely on Yelp for her French tutoring work, which is how I first got in touch with her and why she was so eager to return my initial call—she thought I might be a potential client. Though she’s not in L.A. anymore, she continues to teach French from Belgium over Skype, and her pupils have included Teen Wolf actress Holland Roden, who tweeted her praises earlier this year.

Why were so many mystery writers and others ready to believe—and publicly speculate—that Buelens’ identity was the work of a conspiracy theory without first doing the detective work to confirm their suspicions? It’s possible they were primed for controversy because of Penzler’s involvement in Scarlet: He has been a vocal defender of Linda Fairstein, the prosecutor in the Central Park Five case, after the Mystery Writers of America announced, then withdrew, one of its “Grand Master” awards for her. (When I asked Penzler about it, he would say only that Fairstein has nothing to do with the new imprint.)

The funny thing is Brackmann wasn’t entirely off-base with her initial accusation, because Scarlet is planning to release a book by a male author under a female pseudonym next year—it’s just not Buelens’. Scarlet’s second release, in March, will be You Will Never Know, written by a male author working under the name Sophia Prentiss. Like Buelens’ co-author, the man behind Sophia Prentiss is apparently a well-established author who wants to distance his new work from his past work; it’s actually not all that unusual for men to adopt female pseudonyms when writing crime fiction. Penzler told me he thinks the outrage over men writing for a female-aimed imprint is “silly,” and that the type of book matters more than the author’s gender. He also said that Scarlet originally had plans to include Swedish crime writer Camilla Läckberg among its initial releases but lost the book to Knopf, which is why it pushed Prentiss’ book from February to March—to leave more time to promote Buelens’. He calls the controversy over Buelens’ identity “a nuisance more than anything” by forcing Pegasus to announce the book before it was ready.

Buelens herself laughed when I told her there are people out there who aren’t sure she’s a real person, but didn’t seem offended that some are suggesting she might be a front for the male author of An Inconvenient Woman, which seems too convoluted of a plan to her to be real. “I smirk a little bit at the situation. It wouldn’t be possible. I’m not sure whether to take it seriously or not,” she said, noting that she had only heard about the controversy on Monday and hadn’t yet had a chance to talk to her publisher about what to do about it. “Does it really matter? Do I have to make like a big intervention? I don’t feel threatened, voila. I didn’t do anything wrong. I can tell you that it took me more than a year and a half to put that on paper. ”

She says she has always leaned more toward comedy, but she decided that to make money and reach a wider audience, she was better off writing mystery or suspense like Gone Girl or Girl on the Train. Though she couldn’t give me any specifics about the plot of her debut novel, she says it borrows details from her own life and her work as a French teacher, and that it would be impossible for someone else to mimic that perspective. In the meantime, she is hopeful that the mystery will at least get people interested in the book by the time it comes out: “If it creates buzz, OK, be my guest.”","But rumors about the book—specifically, that its supposedly female author might secretly be a front for a man—were spreading quickly among mystery writers.
It’s weird.” When Pegasus doubled down, he wrote, “We’ll see.”Stephanie Buelens is not a work of fiction invented to sell mystery novels.
She co-wrote it with a friend, an established male writer who, according to Penzler, has published more than 20 books.
She’s originally from Belgium, where she’s been living for the past eight months to take care of her father.
Scarlet’s second release, in March, will be You Will Never Know, written by a male author working under the name Sophia Prentiss.","['scarlet', 'writer', 'publisher', 'didnt', 'book', 'penzler', 'debut', 'convinced', 'twitter', 'mystery', 'french', 'shes', 'author', 'exist', 'work', 'buelens']",2019-06-06 17:06:01+00:00,https://slate.com/culture
74,Sophie Turner Taught Conan O’Brien a Drinking Game That Was Clearly Just an Excuse to Slap the Hell Out of Him,Matthew Dessem,"Are you not entertained? TBS

In an earlier age of show business, showing up on a talk show and then physically assaulting the host was a quick way to get yourself branded a Crispin-Glover-style eccentric.

Fortunately for Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner—and unfortunately for Conan O’Brien—those days are over. Turner stopped by Conan with a bottle of tequila and talked him into playing a “drinking game” with the following rules:

1. Play begins as Conan O’Brien takes a shot of tequila.

2. Sophie Turner then absolutely wallops O’Brien with an open-handed slap to the left cheek, spattering tequila across his chin and sending shock waves through his pompadour.

3. A visibly shaken Conan O’Brien drinks bunch of tequila from the bottle.

Watch and wince:

As nice as it would be to believe that Sophie Turner just dreamed “Tequila Slaps” up as a “Hertz Donut”-type ploy to slap the shit out of Conan O’Brien, the game is at least slightly better-documented than “The Devil’s Triangle”; it appears in a promotional clip for the 2015 Vince Vaughn comedy Unfinished Business. But there’s no sense getting bogged down in the details of who invented what when to slap whom: The important thing is that Sophie Turner found a way to pummel a talk show host on his own show, and still managed to get him to play the clip from Dark Phoenix she was there to promote. In Turner’s honor, and in honor of the barrier she slapped her way through tonight, Slate is proud to present the trailer for River’s Edge, the movie that sent Crispin Glover on his disastrous promotional visit to The Late Show With David Letterman so many years ago:

He was truly a man ahead of his time.","Fortunately for Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner—and unfortunately for Conan O’Brien—those days are over.

75,How Can the Warriors Claw Their Way Back Against the Raptors?,Nick Greene,"Steph Curry can’t overcome the Toronto Raptors on June 5, 2019 in Oakland. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images

The Toronto Raptors may be new to the NBA Finals, but they aren’t naive. They had no pity for a depleted Warriors team on Wednesday and beat the defending champs 123-109 to take a 2-1 series lead. With Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson (oh, and Kevon Looney) out, Splash Only Child Steph Curry attempted to win the game by himself. He managed to put up 47 points, but the Raptors did more than enough to keep Curry at arms’ length (normal, human-sized arms; not little velociraptor arms.)

Golden State has overcome a two-games-to-one Finals deficit before, but that was in 2015 against the Matthew Dellavedova-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The Raptors are playing their best basketball of the season at the best possible time, and it’s going to take a little more than Curry’s one-man band to turn this series around. Specifically, it will take six things.

1. Klay Thompson has less than 48 hours for his hamstring strain to heal before Friday’s pivotal Game 4. I’m no doctor, but pacing around on a hurt leg will probably accelerate the process. This is a good sign.

Klay itching to get in pic.twitter.com/xZGkdH3ASB — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) June 6, 2019

2. Kevin Durant suffered a calf injury in the 2019 Western Conference Finals, which I believe were played around 50 years ago. He should start pacing, STAT.

3. Steph was great in Game 3 and went 17-31 from the field. If he made all 31 of his shots, however, the Warriors would have won. That’s something to consider for Friday.

4. The Raptors’ bench has been a big factor. Backup point guard Fred VlanVleet scored 11 points on Wednesday and sealed the win with a ridiculous heave that nearly kissed Golden State’s banners.

Yeah, uh, don’t let him do that.

5. Draymond Green has a plan and Golden State would be foolish not to follow it.

“… win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6 and then celebrate. Fun times ahead.”

76,NBC Is Making a Drama About the Early Days of Da Vinci Code Hero Robert Langdon,Matthew Dessem,"Oh no! The Louvre! Columbia Pictures

Renowned television network NBC staggered through the vaulted gallery of the Museum of Television. The broadcaster lunged for the nearest unproduced project it could see, an adaptation of The Lost Symbol, a well-known novel by The Da Vinci Code novelist Dan Brown. Partnering with Imagine Television Studios, CBS Television Studios, and Universal Television, the ninety-two-year-old network gave a production commitment to the series, according to influential trade paper Variety, and then NBC collapsed backward in a heap beneath a heaping pile of clichés.

The distinguished network lay for a moment, gasping for breath, breathing in gasps, taking stock. Eminent writer and executive producer Daniel Cerone will write and executive produce. Highly esteemed executive producers Dan Brown, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Francie Calfo, Samie Falvey, and Anna Culp will also be executive producing, but not writing. It crawled out from under the pilot script and scanned the cavernous space for a way out of this ridiculous article.

Only fifteen inches away, outside the confines of the fourth wall, the silhouette of the writer stared at the slowly-growing Slate post. Although he was neither an albino nor a priest, he could probably have used a little more sun and a little less guilt. The pseudo-albino doom-and-gloomster drew the mouse pointer across the screen and aimed it directly at the delete button. “I should not have chosen this conceit.” His accent was not easy to place, because he was typing, not speaking out loud. “No one who wants to know about an NBC adaptation of a Dan Brown novel will be interested in a parody of Dan Brown’s prose, and no one who is interested in a parody of Dan Brown’s prose will be interested in knowing about NBC’s upcoming adaptation of a Dan Brown novel.” The click of a touchpad echoed hollowly through the gallery.

The writer glanced down at the touchpad, almost amused. A misfire. He reached for an external mouse, but then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at the calm, smirking sentences that would never be appear on Slate. “My work here is done.”

Then he was gone.

Alone now, NBC staggered to its feet and turned its gaze to the publish button. It was trapped, and the writer was unlikely to keep a local copy of such an ephemeral and mediocre piece of writing. Even so, the great gripping fear that now gripped it was gripping it with a greater grip than the great fear of deletion had ever managed to grip it greatly with.

I must secure advance publicity for the upcoming NBC series based on The Lost Symbol.

Rising painfully to its feet, NBC thought of the television shows which had come before The Lost Symbol … of the mission which they had all been entrusted.

An unbroken chain of promotional opportunities.

Shivering, it pulled itself to its feet.

I must find some way …

It was trapped within an unpublished blog post, and there existed only one button on earth that would allow it to escape. NBC glanced up at the borders of its opulent Word for Mac window. Wincing in pain, the network summoned all of its faculties and strength until it was standing on its own two feet. The desperate task before it, it knew, would require stretching the post’s conceit well beyond coherence, well beyond the fourth wall, beyond entertainment news itself, deep into the realms of mystery and divinity.

Da Vinci … Titian … And this is for real, his name is spelled T-I-T-I-A-N, honest to God … Botticelli …

77,"In Late Night, Mindy Kaling draws on her history, from being a “diversity hire” on The Office to running The Mindy Project.",Inkoo Kang,"Mindy Kaling in Late Night. Amazon Studios

This post contains mild spoilers for Late Night.

In 2017, during the press tour for A Wrinkle in Time, Reese Witherspoon recalled a conversation she’d had with co-star Mindy Kaling. “Don’t you ever get exhausted by always having to create your own roles?” Witherspoon had asked Kaling. “Reese,” came the reply, “I’ve never had anything that I didn’t create for myself.” While born of necessity, this has given Kaling uncommon control over her projects and screen image, and it’s revealing to look closely at what she’s chosen to do with it. After nearly a decade and a half in the public eye playing a ditzy chatterbox on The Office and a chirpy sociopath on The Mindy Project, Kaling finally seems to settle for the ingenue role in Late Night, her first feature in which she plays a major starring part. (She wrote and produced the movie, which was directed by Nisha Ganatra.) Her character, a newbie comedy writer named Molly Patel, is the kind of relatable underdog certain fans have wanted to see the writer-actress inhabit for years. Late Night suggests that Kaling is as fascinated as ever not by the girl next door but by powerful, unruly women—and the unconventional love stories befitting their willful, idiosyncratic selves. But the film may be most notable for its summation of the thinking and rethinking that Kaling has done about her 15 years in Hollywood—and how to fight to change it.

Like The Devil Wears Prada, Late Night is an odd-couple comedy about two women—a jaded icon and a naïve upstart—who discover that they work far better together than apart. Emma Thompson stars as Katherine Newbury, the improbably female, English, and high-minded host of a network late-night talk show that debuted in the early ’90s and never bothered to change with the times. When a resentful underling points out to the long-coasting Katherine that she doesn’t have a single woman in her writers room, a haphazard search leads to the snap hiring of Molly, a comedy superfan with zero writing experience. Unlike most of her new colleagues, Molly is not only a woman but a person of color with a non–Ivy League education from rural America, living with her aunt and uncle in an outer borough. Plucky and just a little bit dowdy, she couldn’t be more just-moved-to-the-city-to-pursue-her-dreams if she tried.

We’ve seen dozens of protagonists like starry-eyed Molly, but many of the specifics that set Molly apart come from Kaling’s own origin story. Kaling first caught the entertainment industry’s attention by starring as Ben Affleck—yes, you read that correctly—in a play she co-wrote called Matt & Ben, about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck chancing upon the screenplay of Good Will Hunting. (It literally falls from the sky and into their laps.) But her big break came when she was hired for the writers room of The Office through NBC’s diversity program. This formative period in Kaling’s career provides much of the basis for Late Night, as well as the “diversity hire” label whose stigma Kaling contends with so many years later. “I’d rather be a diversity hire than a nepotism hire,” Molly tells naysayer and head monologue writer Tom (Reid Scott), who Kaling has essentially acknowledged is a stand-in for Kaling’s ex-boyfriend B.J. Novak. (Novak was a similarly intimidating Harvard Lampoon alumnus in The Office writers room when the two met.) “At least I had to beat out every other woman and minority to get here. You just had to be born.” Kaling has made similar statements in interviews. There was a time when she thought, “If you’re funny, it’s funny and you’ll get noticed. But that isn’t true,” she told Deadline. “If you don’t know the right people to get into the rooms, you will just never be seen.”

Complaints from Molly’s new co-workers, like “It’s a hostile environment to be an educated white male” and “I wish I could be a woman of color so I could get any job I want with zero qualifications” are met with similar rebuttals. Molly eventually reframes her differences, as well as Katherine’s, as advantages, guiding the host to play up the facts of her femaleness, her age, and her white privilege.

But Kaling doesn’t speak only through Molly. When Molly hits setbacks, she’s advised by several kindly mentors to replace her protests with hard work: “If you want people to see you as something other than a diversity hire, you have to make them.” It’s instruction Kaling herself has given in her book Why Not Me?: “I don’t understand how you could have self-confidence if you don’t do the work,” she writes. “Confidence is like respect; you have to earn it.”

Indeed, as the movie goes on, it becomes clear that Kaling is as interested in critiquing Molly as in having viewers see themselves in her. If viewers mistake Kaling as identifying only with the character she’s playing, and expecting others to do the same, well, it wouldn’t be the first time. While Kaling’s breakthrough role was as Kelly Kapoor on The Office, it was as the star and creator of The Mindy Project that she created a truly groundbreaking comic id, the devilishly narcissistic Mindy Lahiri—then had the character wildly misunderstood as an incompetently written everywoman. In an essay on “the female bad fan,” New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum bemoaned the viewers who took The Mindy Project’s rom-com trappings to mean that its protagonist was, like those of most romantic comedies, an aspirational or familiar figure. Kaling told Nussbaum that she thought playing a female version of Michael Scott, on which Lahiri was based, would be more “fun.”

With Molly, similarly, Kaling seems less invested in bridging an identification with the audience than in mocking Molly’s earnestness and teaching her a more nuanced view of the beneficiaries of privilege. Kaling pokes gentle fun at the trope of that “absurdly confident newcomer” who tactlessly tells her new employer exactly what’s wrong with her show, and Molly learns that men like Tom might have literally inherited their TV writing jobs from their fathers, but aren’t necessarily untalented. Kaling also seems to be satirizing a certain type of social justice warrior—or at least the stereotype of one—by having Molly tell her co-workers that she’s “marginalized by the iron first of white privilege.” Molly is our entry-point character, and while she has legitimate gripes, the character quickly comes to feel like a repository for all the reasons Kaling has never seemed interested in playing roles like this one.

And if viewers still don’t get the message, well, she’s speaking to them through the movie’s other protagonist, a character whom Kaling admits she identifies with just as much as she does with Molly. You can hear Kaling bristling at critics of The Mindy Project in a rant she has Katherine direct at Molly, about “an absurdly confident newcomer coming in, criticizing my show, and giving me her assessment of my comedic persona, without doing the hard work of presenting me with solutions.” Kaling may have started out in Hollywood as a Molly, but she’s become something closer to a Katherine.","Mindy Kaling in Late Night.

78,"Fleabag is obsessed with characters’ hair, especially Claire’s.",Heather Schwedel,"Sian Clifford as Claire and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Fleabag in Fleabag. Steve Schofield/Amazon

Phoebe Waller-Bridge has a thing about hair. It’s a fixation that achieves full volume during Fleabag’s second season, when Waller-Bridge, the show’s creator and star, delivers what may be the single most impassioned monologue about hair ever to appear on a TV show, henceforth known as the “Hair is everything” speech. But this obsession with hair also pops up elsewhere in Fleabag, a persistent cowlick that, once you notice, you can’t stop noticing: Fleabag’s ex commenting on her new “fringe”; Fleabag’s godmother insisting that she’s not wearing a hat but a hair scarf; the portrait of Fleabag that shows only the back of her head so that she’s all hair. The same preoccupation permeates Waller-Bridge’s non-Fleabag oeuvre, too: When asked to summarize her other buzzy show, Killing Eve, for a Vogue video, Waller-Bridge said mischievously, “Murder, murder, hair.” Villanelle, that show’s villain, is obsessed with hero Eve’s dark, thick mane of waves.

What is it with Waller-Bridge and hair? It’s obvious in her work that she recognizes the power hair can have, especially for women, as it governs our days and influences our moods more than we often acknowledge. That’s what “Hair is everything” means in a speech that occurs in the fifth episode of Fleabag’s second season. Fleabag has stormed into a hair salon, indignant on behalf of her sister, Claire, who just received a haircut that makes her look “like a pencil.” “Don’t blame me for your bad choices,” the hairdresser protests to the sisters. “Hair isn’t everything.” That’s when Fleabag unleashes the following:

Hair is everything. We wish it wasn’t so we could actually think about something else occasionally. But it is. It’s the difference between a good day and a bad day. We’re meant to think that it’s a symbol of power, that it’s a symbol of fertility. Some people are exploited for it and it pays your fucking bills. Hair is everything.

It’s a withering, triumphant speech, one that sounds unassailable as it comes out of Waller-Bridge’s mouth—until the show undercuts it a moment later. Claire calls for someone to find the picture she’d brought in as a reference, which she thinks will prove once and for all that the hairdresser went rogue. Instead, a salon employee produces a page torn out of a magazine in which a model’s hair is styled exactly like Claire’s new cut. The hairdresser is vindicated. “If you want to change your life, change your life,” he says, tired, presumably, of all the women who have come to him thinking a new haircut will reinvent them.

Symbolic hair transformations—long to short, curly to smooth, chemically straightened to natural—are a pop-culture mainstay, but throughout two seasons of ups and downs, Fleabag’s hair has stayed more or less the same. Yes, there’s Harry’s aforementioned comment about her new fringe, but it’s such a subtle difference between seasons that without the show calling attention to it, you might not have given the change in style a second thought. Even when Fleabag thinks she looks inconveniently beautiful on the day of her mother’s funeral, her appearance is basically unchanged. “No matter what I do with my hair, it just keeps falling in this really chic way,” she frets. Again, she looks the same as usual, but Claire and everyone else at the funeral comment on her exceptional appearance. It’s as though in the world envisioned by Fleabag, everyone is as obsessed with and attuned to hair as she is.

It’s through Claire, not Fleabag, that the show gets to play with the trope of a life-changing haircut. Though the hairdresser entertainingly shoots down the sisters’ and the viewer’s expectation of a transformational, climactic makeover, Claire’s life does change after she changes her ’do. Waller-Bridge seems to be acknowledging the truth in both viewpoints: Hair is both a superficial thing we’re not supposed to care about and something that matters deeply and toward which many women dedicate countless hours of thought and effort. Correlation does not necessarily equal causation, since Claire’s haircut didn’t magically change her life, but the fact remains that she did finally change her life after changing her hair. At the very least, the show has given us a hell of a signpost to pay attention to hair in the rest of the show.

Hair is fundamental to what is perhaps Fleabag’s most significant relationship, the bond between Claire and Fleabag, who both care a lot about their looks in general, despite the apparent feminist contradiction of that stance. Fleabag has a habit of complimenting Claire’s hair, but it’s usually unclear whether she’s genuinely trying to be nice, passive-aggressively pushing her sister’s buttons, or some combination of the two. The first time this happens, in the show’s very first episode, Claire responds, “Oh, fuck off.” But when it happens again in the next episode, Claire says quietly, almost whimpering, “It’s better.” Claire hates to be vulnerable, and her hair is a constant vulnerability that Fleabag uses both as a way to needle her sister and a secret message to be decoded. “Plaits,” she observes aloud to the camera in a Season 1 episode when she encounters her sister in braids. “Either she’s got her period or some serious shit’s gone down.” Fleabag goes on to explain that Claire tries to reinvent herself as a way to get through menstrual pain, yet another vulnerability Claire doesn’t want to own up to.

Obsessing over their hair becomes a way to express their love for each other when doing so outright feels impossible.

The Fleabag-Claire bond is also what eventually brings on the “Hair is everything” speech. The two harbor long-standing resentments against each other, and their relationship often hovers somewhere between strained and estranged. When Claire has a miscarriage early on in Season 2, she repeatedly refuses Fleabag’s help and pleas for her to go to the hospital because she doesn’t want anyone to know what she’s going through or to show any weakness.

This makes it all the more hilarious that later in the season, Claire calls Fleabag crying and claiming an emergency, and she turns out to be calling about her haircut. To be fair, it’s quite a haircut: It consists of blunt-cut, thick bangs paired with something like a slightly longer version of a bowl cut, except asymmetrical, so it’s longer on one side. It makes Claire look at once severe, overly done-up, and out of touch. Fleabag is the only person Claire trusts to help her deal with it, and even though Claire demands the truth, Fleabag knows that, after admitting the haircut is “horrendous,” it’s her job to try to make Claire feel better. Claire shoots down Fleabag’s suggestions that maybe they can re-position the haircut as actually cool or edgy, but Fleabag’s offer that “It’s French!” seems to provide some measure of comfort. That’s when Fleabag heads into the salon to raise hell.

Out of context, the “Hair is everything” speech asks the audience to consider the significance of hair, but within the show, it also marks a crucial turn in Claire and Fleabag’s relationship: Claire has finally admitted that she needs help and allows Fleabag to show up for her. And it’s fitting that when she does, it’s about her hair. Later, at the wedding, the hair emergency has mostly been defused when it turns out that Claire’s Finnish colleague, whom she has a crush on, likes her hair, and she’s able to attach a hairpiece to it to make it look a little more presentable, if still fragile. Like Fleabag and Claire’s relationship, it’s awkward, but it basically works.

The pencil haircut BBC Three/Giphy

Fleabag ends with a wedding, that of Fleabag’s father and godmother, which provides the opportunity to sneak in one last hair reference in the priest’s homily. “Love is awful,” he begins, and goes on to say that one of the terrible things love does is that it “makes you obsessed with your hair.” He’s talking about romantic love, but it’s also true in a way of sisterly love, or at least the love between Fleabag and Claire. For them, obsessing over their hair becomes a way to express their love for each other when doing so outright feels impossible. That brings us back to Waller-Bridge’s thing about hair: In this case, it’s really a thing about love.","Sian Clifford as Claire and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Fleabag in Fleabag.

79,Jussie Smollett will not return for Empire’s final season.,Natalia Winkelman,"Jussie Smollett after his court appearance in Chicago on March 26. Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images

Jussie Smollett, the actor accused of staging a hate crime against himself earlier this year, will not be returning for Empire’s sixth and final season. The show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, confirmed the news in a statement on Tuesday.

Smollett’s future on the Fox show has been up in the air since he was indicted for allegedly filing a false police report following what he described as a racist and homophobic attack. He was later accused of having hired the men who assaulted him out of dissatisfaction with his Empire salary. Smollett maintained his innocence, and in an unexpected reversal in March, the charges against him were dropped. But questions surrounding the case remained, and the city of Chicago is suing the actor in order to recoup the cost of the investigation.

Due to lingering uncertainty, many wondered whether Smollett’s role on Empire would be eliminated. His departure has now been confirmed, courtesy of a tweet from Daniels:

The revelation arrived in response to a Variety report in which production sources said that Empire writers were working under the expectation that Smollett would eventually be back in Season 6. His character was removed from the final episodes of Season 5 following the controversy “to avoid further disruption on set,” producers said in a statement in February.

Tensions on set have reportedly been high since the case against Smollett, and in April, Empire cast members appealed for his return in a letter to Fox executives. “Together, as a united front, we stand with Jussie Smollett and ask that our co-star, brother and friend be brought back for our sixth season of Empire,” read the letter, which was signed by series stars including Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard. According to Variety, the Empire team remains divided: The show’s cast, which is mostly black, still believes Smollett is innocent, while many of its mostly white below-the-line crew think him guilty.","Jussie Smollett after his court appearance in Chicago on March 26.

82,How Mookie Betts Built a Better Swing,Ben Lindbergh,"Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox waits at bat against the New York Mets on March 9 in Fort Myers, Florida. Michael Reaves/Getty Images

The following essay is adapted from The MVP Machine: How Baseball’s New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players, out now from Basic Books.

April 16, 2018, was an off day in Los Angeles for the Boston Red Sox. But for outfielder Mookie Betts, there would be no rest.

Boston hitting coach Tim Hyers suggested to Betts that he spend the day working with the silver-haired, blue-eyed Doug Latta, a self-described swing whisperer. On that Monday morning, Latta drove to the team hotel and picked up Betts, who brought with him a couple of his personalized Axe Bats, which feature handles shaped like that of a hatchet. They drove to a facility Latta occasionally used that was closer to Anaheim than his own Los Angeles headquarters: the covered batting cages at Anteater Ballpark, home of the UC–Irvine college baseball team, whose coach was a friend.

The 25-year-old Betts was coming off an excellent 2017 season, albeit a disappointing one for him. His .803 OPS (on-base plus slugging) was slightly above average but down significantly from his .897 mark the previous season. Many athletes are afraid to change. Betts wasn’t, even if that meant listening to the advice of an outside instructor like Latta, whose own playing career never advanced past junior college. Already a two-time All-Star, Betts wanted to be better.

Many of the hitters who had previously sought change were desperate, seeking to extend careers. But what if a top-shelf talent like Betts—renowned for his elite hand-eye coordination and athleticism and already experimenting with a nontraditional bat handle designed to enhance bat speed and control—adopted a better swing? What if stars started rethinking their potential and making large leaps?

Hyers joined the Red Sox after the 2017 season, following a two-year stint as the assistant hitting coach for the Dodgers. A Georgia native with a trace of a Southern accent, Hyers had a brief big-league career, batting .217 with two homers in 133 career games for the Padres, Marlins, and Tigers. He had been taught to swing down on the ball. He didn’t think he could be a power hitter. He thought his skill level was fixed.

Hyers sought out Latta late in the spring of 2016 after speaking with Dodgers infielder Justin Turner about the swing he learned from Latta. They met for breakfast one morning in the suburb of Silver Lake. The meeting lasted four hours.

Up to that point, few professional coaches had accepted Latta into their circles of trust. He was perceived as an unwelcome outsider who meddled with other coaches’ players. But as Boston’s charter arrived in Los Angeles on that early season road trip, Hyers wanted “another set of eyes”—Latta’s eyes—on a swing Betts had begun to forge that spring. Latta was a master at understanding how every part of the body worked in concert.

As Latta drove Betts to the UC–Irvine baseball facility, he asked him if he was sure he wanted to exert himself. Betts had been out of the lineup Sunday after injuring his left foot in a collision at home plate the day before. He said he was fine, and X-rays were negative. So they went to work as Latta does with almost every hitter. “We want the hand path to work and get length,” said Latta of creating an upswing with extension, “to get the body balanced and move forward.”

They worked together in private for several hours in open-air cages covered by hunter-green corrugated metal. The next day, Betts returned to the lineup against the Angels’ rookie sensation Shohei Ohtani. Betts batted first, where he had taken the vast majority of his at-bats as a big leaguer. At 5-foot-9, 180 pounds, he had the body of a leadoff hitter in addition to elite hand-eye ability. He had shown surprising power. That threat was about to become even more significant.

In the Anaheim twilight, Ohtani threw a full-count fastball that came close to the plate, knee-high. A keen observer could have noticed that Betts’s swing—already much changed that spring under Hyers’ instruction—looked different. As Ohtani delivered, Betts lifted his left leg and began his stride toward the pitcher. His hands dropped lower, toward his belt. As he moved forward, his hands stayed back and “under” the ball, as Latta teaches, which would enable his bat to travel on an uppercut trajectory. Pitches travel at downward angles, both because they’re released from an elevated mound and because gravity acts upon them. A flat bat path is on plane with a pitch for a very short period of time. An upward path increases the odds of optimum contact.

In a blur, the barrel connected with the Ohtani pitch and drove it high into the violet sky, the silhouette of the San Gabriel Mountains still visible in the distance. Rather than wrapping around his back as it often did, Betts’s follow-through traveled on a path that finished high and slightly above his shoulders. It was almost like a golfer’s swing—or like Turner’s.

The ball traveled 411 feet, landing beyond the left-center-field fence and ricocheting off the faux boulders and back onto the field. Betts ran around the bases, businesslike. No smile cracked his countenance.

When Betts came up in the third inning, Luke Bard had replaced Ohtani. Bard’s second pitch to Betts was a hanging slider. Betts again dropped his hands lower. His bat got on plane with the pitch earlier, and he drove slightly under and through the ball with lightning-quick hands. He again finished higher in his follow-through. Betts launched the ball beyond the bullpens in left-center field, 417 feet away from home plate. He lowered his head and subtly flipped his bat.

In the eighth inning, Betts faced Cam Bedrosian. As the temperature dropped throughout the evening, Betts blew on his hands prior to grasping his Axe Bat and stepping back into the right-handed batter’s box. Bedrosian’s first pitch was an inside fastball. Betts swung, making contact well out in front of the plate, where most home-run contact happens. The ball soared toward center field. This time Betts watched it briefly, and a small grin appeared. The ball landed on an AstroTurf knoll beyond the playing surface, 427 feet away: his third home run of the game. And on May 2, Betts would author another three-homer game.

Betts was following the trail blazed before him by a select group of hitters, including one Latta had helped transform from a castoff into a star.

On Sept. 6, 2013, Turner, then a New York Mets utility infielder, borrowed the bat of teammate Lucas Duda and walked into the on-field batting cage at Progressive Field in downtown Cleveland. It was the beginning of one of the most unthinkable transformations in modern baseball history.

Turner’s former Mets teammate, Marlon Byrd, had been traded a week earlier to the Pirates. Turner and Byrd had spoken often about hitting. The public was suspicious of Byrd’s 2013 breakout because Byrd had been suspended for 50 games in 2012 after testing positive for a banned substance that masks steroid use. (Byrd would retire in 2016 after testing positive for a banned substance again.) But Turner—and another light-hitting Mets infielder named Daniel Murphy—listened to Byrd in 2013 because Byrd had changed his approach to hitting in a way that had nothing to do with drugs.

Byrd was 6 feet tall with a 245-pound frame, and yet prior to 2013, he had been a ground-ball hitter. “I came from more of an old-school style of baseball,” Byrd told Travis in 2013. “Coming up, the coaches I had played for in the 1970s and 1980s, they were taught to swing down.”

Byrd’s breakout 2013 season, which featured career-bests in home runs (22) and slugging percentage (.526), came at an age, 36, when players are typically in decline. His preceding suspension made the stats look like a chemical mirage, but in a single offseason, Byrd had changed the nature of how he swung and the angle at which his bat struck the ball.

Byrd and Turner conversed during batting practice, during games, and on late-night charter flights as they crisscrossed the country to fulfill the demands of the major-league schedule.

Turner was intrigued by Byrd’s radical new theories of hitting. Byrd spoke about how Latta had helped him adopt a leg kick and more loft in his swing the previous winter. As a result, he was more direct in his movement to the pitch. Turner knew Byrd had decreased his ground-ball rate from 49.6 percent in 2012 (which was near his career rate) to 39.2 percent in 2013, while raising his fly-ball rate by 12.2 percentage points, the third-greatest increase in baseball. Professional batters take tens of thousands of swings between when they first pick up a bat and when they make it to pro ball, hardwiring a swing path into their muscle memory. Most coaches thought that trait couldn’t be changed. Byrd challenged that notion, suggesting that hitters could evolve, and relatively quickly, even at advanced ages.

Byrd embraced a style completely different from what Mets hitting instructor Dave Hudgens advocated. (Hudgens would later adjust his beliefs when he became the Astros’ hitting coach.) Early that spring, Byrd launched ball after ball out of a spring training backfield at the club’s Port St. Lucie complex. The Mets’ staff told him his new swing wouldn’t work in games. He was sure they were wrong. Hitters were taught that home runs were blissful accidents, and that they ought to try for low line drives. Byrd believed in trying to hit home runs in games and in practice. He was done with conventional wisdom.

Turner had not homered in his 183 plate appearances in 2013, and he started Sept. 6 with a .639 OPS, well below the league average. He was a bench player known for his glove, shock of red hair, and amber beard. But on this midafternoon in Cleveland prior to a 7:05 p.m. game, Turner tried on a new identity.

Duda’s bat was an inch longer and an ounce heavier than his own model—34 inches, 33 ounces—which is why Turner chose it. Maybe it would help him generate more power. As he entered the on-field batting cage to begin his experiment, he thought about what Byrd had preached: “Take a large stride. Gain ground.” In other words, move toward the pitcher, creating a more linear path that would transfer energy more efficiently. Byrd also harped on contact point, explaining that batters should think about catching the pitch out in front of the plate, whereas most traditional teaching held that batters should let the ball travel longer and deeper, closer to the plate. Catching the ball out front would better organize the body and allow for the ball to be pulled into the air: the most valuable batted-ball type in baseball. In 2018, MLB batters hit .565 with a 1.267 slugging mark on pull-side air balls, and 32.7 percent of such batted balls went for home runs.

All his life, Turner had been told to let the ball travel as deep as possible and to try to hit low line drives. Now, Turner, who would turn 29 in November, was ready to experiment. He knew the Mets might not tender him a contract after the season. If he wanted to play more, or at all, he had to change. He had to hit.

All his life, Turner had been told to hit low line drives. Now, he was ready to experiment.

Turner had studied kinesiology at Cal State–Fullerton, where he hit seven home runs in 1,008 at-bats. While Byrd’s theories made sense, Turner didn’t think he could become a home-run hitter. He had hit just six home runs over parts of five major-league seasons. But unlike Betts, he had little to lose. He traded in a fixed mindset for a growth one.

“I was thinking, I’m just going to try and catch the ball as far out as I can in batting practice,” Turner says.

Only a few saw the beginning. They saw Turner connect with pitches that began to fly over the 19-foot, left field wall. The clank of balls against empty bleachers resonated throughout the mostly empty ballpark. It was a sound Turner was not accustomed to creating. Teammates raised eyebrows.

“I didn’t even feel like I was swinging hard,” Turner says. “I was like, ‘this is amazing.’ ”

In his first two at-bats on Sept. 6, Turner grounded out versus Scott Kazmir. But in the top of the seventh, he faced right-handed reliever Cody Allen. A paltry crowd of 15,962 watched as Turner caught an elevated fastball well out in front of the plate.

The feeling of hitting a home run was alien to Turner. He ran out of the box. His attention was fixed on Cleveland center fielder Michael Bourn, who raced backward. “Get over his head! Get over his head!” Turner exclaimed in his head, his heart hammering as he approached first base, the ball he had struck still hanging in the air. Turner was as astonished as anyone when the ball vanished into a row of trees beyond the center-field fence.

“I was like, ‘oh my God, what just happened?’ ” Turner says. “I didn’t hit enough home runs to know what it was like when I got it.”

Turner floated around the bases, trying to keep his composure, trying to be emotionless, acting as if he had been there before. Except that he hadn’t been there before. His teammates were slack-jawed. “Swaggy,” as Turner was nicknamed, did that? Following the game, Turner met his then–girlfriend, now wife, at the Jack Casino in downtown Cleveland. Under the lights, above the din of the casino, Turner couldn’t stop talking about what he felt and what he might have found.

Two days later, the Mets and Turner faced the Indians and hard-throwing rookie Danny Salazar on a sunny Sunday afternoon. During his second at-bat, with the count three balls and one strike, Salazar challenged Turner with an elevated 96mph fastball. Turner caught the pitch out in front of the plate. The ball soared on a majestic trajectory, landing halfway up the sun-soaked, left-center-field bleachers. It was as if Roy Hobbs had stolen Turner’s jersey and hit right-handed.

For the eighth time in his career—and the second time in three days— Turner circled the bases.

Turner played in 10 games with the new swing that September. In that limited sample, he batted .387 and slugged .677. He knew he needed to visit Doug Latta.

Amid the urban sprawl of Northridge, California, close to a Costco, a mobile home park, and an In-N-Out Burger, is a long, narrow business park that terminates near a set of railroad tracks. In one of the business park’s long, narrow units, Latta transforms hitters.

Inside Latta’s facility, the Ball Yard, are two batting cages, a couple of couches, a half bathroom, and a kitchenette. Everything one needs to hit for hours. Outside the main batting cage is a large television whose screen Latta has covered with a clear sheet of plastic so he can pause video and use marker to scribble over the image, identifying flaws—his homemade Telestrator. It is a modest, white-drywalled space with a green AstroTurf floor, but as Latta tells hitters who might be expecting a more lavish facility when they first walk in, “We don’t need much space to get better.” The same goes for any hotbed of talent development: All that’s required are ideas, information, passion, and reps. Lots and lots of reps. The Ball Yard was where, in the winter of 2013–2014, Latta helped Turner morph from a journeyman into a something more.

At the Ball Yard in 2018, Latta scrolls through his video library, finds some early footage of Turner, and plays it on the flat-screen television outside the batting cage. It’s from Jan. 27, 2014.

Turner was unemployed then. He’d been nontendered by the Mets. On the video, Turner has a shorter beard and wears a T-shirt, shorts, and a hat turned backward. He takes a swing. He goes into his leg kick and takes an exaggerated stride.

“This is before he narrowed up,” Latta says of Turner’s stance. “Those days we were just pumping.”

By “pumping,” Latta means taking a lot of swings. Latta pulls up another video of Turner from April 24, 2014, after Turner had signed a minor-league deal with the Dodgers with an invite to spring training—and ended up making the team as a replacement for the recently retired Michael Young. Turner was still a part-time player. In the clip, his hands are higher than they were in January. So is his leg kick. He looks off-balance several times, finishing with his feet out of the would-be batter’s box as he gathers himself. As he swings, he rocks his weight on his back leg, which is a no-no for Latta.

“People forget that’s how J.T. looked then,” Latta says. “He’s gotten narrower, the leg kicks up more. It got easier and easier and easier.”

Latta and Turner weren’t alone. Byrd was often there also, hitting and serving as something of a quasi–assistant coach.

“It was hard. It was tough. I had 25 years of habits to break,” Turner says. “Marlon had talked about it all year long, so I kind of had a head start going in there, knowing what [Latta] was talking about.”

Over that winter, Turner trained at the Ball Yard for three months, four days a week. He and Latta worked for three hours per session, taking seven or eight rounds of batting practice per hour, 15 to 20 pitches per round. He estimates that he took 20,000 swings.

Latta has documented Turner’s entire evolution. Since that winter, most of their interaction has come through texting, though Turner sometimes stops by the Ball Yard for a tune-up. Latta interacts with clients he has less familiarity with through FaceTime. He watches most of Turner’s at-bats live. At first, Latta sent constant reinforcements. If he saw footage of Babe Ruth’s swing on MLB Network or elsewhere, he’d capture it and send it to Turner. Ruth had a narrow stance with an exaggerated stride. He contacted the ball out front. His back foot left contact with the ground. Turner laughed about the Ruth video during spring training 2018.

“ ‘Look at Babe, he’s really staying back and catching the ball deep,’ ” Turner said, recounting the text from Latta that accompanied the video. Ruth did the exact opposite of the conventional teaching Latta and Turner were mocking, complete with an uppercut swing.

“You look at Ruth, Mantle, all these hitters back in the day, they all leg kick or toe tap. They all gain a ton of ground. Their strides are huge. … It’s the theory that whatever starts in motion, stays in motion. … Isaac Newton is my favorite hitting coach. The whole old-school mentality of swinging down, chopping down on the ball? It’s bullshit.”

Turner slammed the table with a fist in frustration. How many coaches had let down how many players?

In 2014, Turner hit .340/.404/.493. He made only 322 plate appearances, but among all hitters with at least 300 trips to the plate, his 158 weighted runs created plus (wRC+), a comprehensive rate stat, ranked ninth (100 is league average). The Dodgers were curious enough to retain the arbitration-eligible Turner on a one-year, $2.5 million deal. In 2015, he made 439 plate appearances and hit nearly as well as he had the year before, slashing .294/.370/.491 with a 141 wRC+. Between 2013 and 2015, he cut his ground-ball rate by 12.5 percentage points, the fourth-greatest decline in the game. In 2016, Turner earned a full-time role. He hit 27 homers. After that season, he signed a four-year, $64 million contract with the Dodgers.

In the summer of 2018 at the Ball Yard, Latta pulls up another evolution-of-Turner video from January 2017. By now, Turner is much narrower in his stance. There is no rocking back on his back leg to move forward. As his left leg lifts to initiate his swing, his hands fall to create the proper slot for an uppercut swing.

“What’s J.T. trying to create? Balance and drive,” Latta says.

Latta plays it again in slow motion. Turner’s back leg and shoulder remain perfectly in line. There is no backward weight transfer or movement. He’s balanced. He lands with his front (left) leg well in front of his body. His hands are lowered and ready to fire. “Body is moving in concert,” Latta says. “From this position he fires right underneath. He picks up his backside, and all that energy drives through the ball. He gets what we call a lot of extension.” In slow motion, the swing finishes. Latta outlines the path of the upswing with marker on the plastic sheet covering the television screen. He notes that all of Turner’s energy is transferred to a contact area in front of the plate.

Latta has a HitTrax radar unit to measure launch angle and exit velocity, but he rarely employs the latest technological advances. If a hitter doesn’t have timing and balance and movement, he has no shot, Latta believes. He’s troubled by the teaching he sees on social media, where video clips focus on creating exit velocity at the expense of balance and adaptable swings. Latta rarely uses the words swing or swing plane when talking about hitters. He tries to organize the body in such a way that the swing takes care of itself. He believes that some in the independent-player-development business are more worried about selling products than helping athletes.

Ground zero of the fly-ball revolution was arguably the Ball Yard, where other teachers and advocates of the movement met and discussed ideas. Byrd spread the knowledge to Turner and Murphy in New York. (Murphy hit 62 homers in more than 3,300 at-bats through age 30, and then hit 60 more in fewer than 1,400 at-bats from ages 31 to 33.) Turner now proselytizes in the Dodgers clubhouse, teaching or reinforcing the beliefs of talented young hitters like Cody Bellinger and Corey Seager, and even influencing some hitting instructors like Hyers. When Bellinger was having trouble with sliders as a rookie in 2017, he wondered if his swing was too uppercut-oriented. Turner had him play a game late that summer. They went into the team’s indoor batting cage at Dodger Stadium. Turner turned on the slider machine and told Bellinger to try to swing and miss below the sliders. Bellinger couldn’t do it; he couldn’t miss. Bellinger produced a .418 weighted on-base average (wOBA) versus sliders in 2017 and a .341 mark in 2018, easily eclipsing the league averages of .271 and .263, respectively. His upswing worked.

The fly-ball revolution also spread thanks to Statcast, which in 2015 began to measure the launch angle and exit velocity of almost every ball hit in every MLB game. Teams started to outfit their batting cages at all levels with swing- and ball-tracking technology. The data confirmed that air balls were better than grounders: With every 10-degree increment from minus 30 degrees to 30 degrees (where zero is a level line drive), the leaguewide wOBA on contact in 2018 increased, easily surpassing the all-angles average of .315. (The average home run left the bat at a vertical angle of 28.2 degrees.)

-30 to -20: .050 -20 to -10: .188 -10 to 0: .245 0 to 10: .462 10 to 20: .712 20 to 30: .731

Between growing awareness of that relationship and a still-unexplained change in the composition of the official MLB ball in 2015, which caused balls in the air to carry farther, hitters had more incentive to swing up. The average launch angle of a batted ball has increased in every year of Statcast: from 10.5 degrees in 2015, to 10.8 in 2016, 11.1 in 2017, and 11.7 in 2018. Over the same span, the rate of balls hit at a 10-degree angle or higher has increased by 3.3 percentage points. According to data from Baseball Prospectus, the leaguewide ground-ball rate in 2018 was the lowest on record, going back to 1950.

In 2017, MLB hitters launched 6,105 home runs, breaking the previous record (set in 2000) by 412. That year, 2018, and 2016, respectively, featured the three highest rates of home runs per fair batted ball in history, surpassing the so-called steroid era.

“Elevate and celebrate” and “Ground balls suck” became batting-cage cries. In 2018, Red Sox skipper Alex Cora said, “We don’t like hitting ground balls. We like hitting the ball in the air.” His statement mirrored a Cubs catchphrase—“There’s no slug on the ground”—as well as Pirates manager Clint Hurdle’s advice to his team: “Your OPS is in the air.” An outsider philosophy had spawned insider slogans.

Latta didn’t set out to change baseball. He simply loved the game. He grew up in what he describes as “tough” financial circumstances and didn’t play organized baseball until he reached high school. Instead he played in a sandlot down the street in his childhood Koreatown neighborhood, where he and his friends used the back of an accommodating neighbor’s garage as a backstop. He went on to play at Los Angeles City College, a public community college, and later Cal Lutheran. After college he joined the Pasadena Redbirds, an adult hardball league.

“The challenge was always there to be able to build myself, to get better, and to realize that you could beat the odds,” Latta says. “We were playing major-league-caliber pitchers—like Ed Farmer, Jerry Reuss, Craig Chamberlain—so we were getting challenged.”

Latta turned down a chance to play in the Mexican League. He already had a better-paying job: At 19, Latta had begun his own business cleaning private swimming pools. He continued to play baseball for the Redbirds until 1995. During his time with the team, he met a professional scout named Craig Wallenbrock. They developed a friendship. Latta describes Wallenbrock as “a thinking man.” Wallenbrock was a devoted reader, and he applied his studies to baseball, giving private hitting lessons beginning in the late 1980s.

“Elevate and celebrate” and “Ground balls suck” became batting-cage cries.

While his playing days were over by the late ’90s, Latta thought he had information to share. He also had space to share. He owned part of a large industrial building in Los Angeles, where he stored pool chemicals for what was then a state-of-the-art chlorine-injection system. When he had an opportunity to buy the other half of the industrial structure, Latta had an idea: He would build an indoor batting cage in the other half of the building. He could give lessons and rent out the cages. He named the facility the Ball Yard.

“We didn’t even have any indoor batting cages in the area,” Latta says. “They just did not exist.”

Latta spent four months personally doing the demolition of what had been office space. He installed AstroTurf and batting cages. Wallenbrock asked if he could hold some of his hitting sessions there. Another instructor was interested in using the space, but that instructor wanted to use “flat-bat stuff,” Latta recalls. “I told myself, hell no.” Wallenbrock was more aligned with Latta’s philosophy, so they reached an agreement for Wallenbrock to train hitters in his space. No hitter was ever taught to chop wood, swing down on the ball, or hit grounders at the Ball Yard, Latta says. Wallenbrock brought in a great number of hitters, including some major leaguers.

The Ball Yard began to host regular meetings with other hitting coaches inside and outside professional baseball, which Latta labels a think tank. Latta kept about 30 folding chairs on hand for the sessions, which grew in size and frequency. The attendees talked about hitting philosophies, some of them out of favor or forgotten like those of the great Ted Williams, who was hitting fly balls before they were cool. “If you get the ball into the air with power, you have the gift to produce the most important hit in baseball: the home run. … For those purposes, I advocate a slight upswing,” wrote Williams in his 1970 book The Science of Hitting. Former major leaguer turned instructor Don Slaught was a frequent visitor, as was Greg Walker, who had served as a hitting coach with the White Sox and Braves. The group met for years.

“I like to say that was my graduate work,” Latta says, “working side by side with Craig for 14 years seeing what [pro hitters] were going through. How do you buy that experience?”

Eventually, Wallenbrock and Latta had a falling-out, and Wallenbrock took his higher-profile clients elsewhere. Latta moved into a new facility, the present-day Ball Yard. Years went by. Latta continued to teach his unusual, uppercut-swing philosophy to players, mostly local college and high-school kids. And one day in the fall of 2012, Marlon Byrd walked through Latta’s door looking for a place to hit in the offseason. Byrd became his first major-league client.

On Feb. 6, 2017, Travis published an article at FanGraphs entitled, “Can More Hitters Get Off the Ground?” Fly-ball and line-drive rates had remained stable from 2012 to 2016, through the depths of baseball’s offensive depression, when a pair of low-power teams in the Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants accounted for three World Series titles in five years. In 2014, before the altered ball took flight, teams averaged only 4.07 runs scored per game, the lowest total in a nonstrike season since 1976, and both MLB insiders and fans fretted about how offense could be boosted in a high-velocity era. A few minutes after the story, which quoted Latta, was published online, Latta received a call from Hyers.

“At 7:32 a.m. Tim called me and said, ‘Andrew Friedman just called me about that article,’ ” Latta says. “The president of the Dodgers. Wow. Cool. I had told [Hyers] it was coming out. ‘Friedman got in the office and read it,’ [Hyers said]. I was like, wow, Friedman reads FanGraphs. He had no heads up. For him to get in and read it in two minutes, you never actually know who is paying attention.”

The article created debate within the Dodgers’ hitting circles, which included both more traditionally minded voices like the club’s head hitting coach, Turner Ward, and others like Wallenbrock, who had worked with the club as a consultant, and his understudy Robert Van Scoyoc, who was named as the Dodgers’ hitting coach after the 2018 season. The fly-ball revolution, and the rethinking of development as a whole, had first spread from player to player via word of mouth. Now teams wanted to disseminate it throughout their entire organizations.

For decades, coaches—always ex-professional players—had enjoyed a privileged place in the vertical hierarchy of teaching and decision-making. But more and more coaches were being questioned and challenged. Many were soon to be replaced. Ideas that had begun outside the game were trickling up into the professional ranks. Latta was just one garage startup disrupting the industry.

At the end of 2017, Hyers joined the Red Sox as their head hitting coach. He and the Sox sought to revamp their hitting philosophy. Another new face, J.D. Martinez, was told by the Red Sox coaching staff to make Mookie his “project.” As Martinez watched Betts hit for the first time in the spring with his 2017 stroke, he said, “I don’t know that that’s going to work.” Betts was not offended. He wanted information.

Martinez signed a five-year $110 million deal with the Red Sox over the winter of 2017–2018, several years after reinventing his own swing and saving his career. Through 2013, Martinez had been a replacement-level big leaguer. In his first three years in the majors, he posted an 87 wRC+. He was a below-average hitter and a poor defender. He career was in jeopardy.

“You still talk to coaches, ‘Oh, you want a line drive right up the middle. Right off the back of the L-screen,’ ” Martinez told Travis in 2017. “OK, well that’s a fucking single.”

Martinez began to question why his best swing would result in a “fucking single.” The same winter as Turner, he sought a new swing. He found it in a facility in suburban Los Angeles with assistance from Wallenbrock and his protégé Van Scoyoc.

“I have this little theory,” Martinez says. “When I think about the best players, I think what makes people so good is when they have that insecurity about themselves … because they don’t want to fall off. It keeps them working. I feel like [Betts] had that little doubt. … Other guys have good years and they won’t make the change. He was like, ‘Dude, I have to figure this out. I don’t have it figured out.’ ”

Betts’ overhaul worked from the bottom up, too. Hyers and Martinez first stressed how his feet interacted with the ground. That was where the kinetic chain of the swing began. “I had to fix the ground before I fixed my hands,” Martinez says. “The engine is down there.” The Red Sox now travel with force plates that measure ground- interaction forces. The portable devices are set up in the tunnels of MLB stadiums so that hitters can measure their force and balance. They look something like large digital scales and, like TrackMan, were first popularized in golf. Betts had never thought about using the ground.

“He’d just been hitting away his whole life and didn’t think much of it,” Hyers says.

“Other guys have good years and they won’t make the change. [Betts] was like, ‘Dude, I have to figure this out. I don’t have it figured out.’ ” — J.D. Martinez

Like Turner in Los Angeles, Martinez is something of a Johnny Appleswing, a willing teacher and a clubhouse peer who reinforces Hyers’s philosophy. Among the 260 MLB hitters with at least 150 batted balls in both 2017 and 2018, Betts, center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr., and shortstop Xander Bogaerts ranked fourth, eighth, and 11th in year-to-year increase in hard-hit rate (the percentage of balls hit 95 mph or faster). Betts, Bogaerts, and Bradley also ranked first, second, and 30th, respectively, in year-to-year increase in barrels (a Statcast term for “balls someone hit the snot out of”) per batted ball.

“I have to give a big credit to J.D. Martinez,” Hyers says. “When you have a superstar and you have a guy who’s already proven it, to come in and back what you’re saying and have those conversations one-on-one with players. … J.D. was huge on saying, ‘Hey Mookie, you can do this part.’ And they had their own private conversations that helped a ton also.”

Now Betts has become a hitting tastemaker, too, inspiring rivals to reject the round knob at a time when some bat companies, like golf-club designers, have begun to use swing sensors to determine the perfect fit for each player in length, weight, and grip. “You start seeing that [Betts] has an influence within the league,” says Axe Bat’s Trevor Stocking. “[George] Springer asked him for a bat, and now all of a sudden Springer’s swinging Mookie’s bat, so now Springer is giving the bat to another player, and [it’s] kind of this wheel … where they’re passing on the equipment.”

They’re also passing on the swing, and hitters are getting off the ground younger. Byrd bought into fly balls at the tail end of his career. Turner saw the light just prior to turning 30. Martinez and Betts made the change in their primes. Now they’re modeling good batter behavior for impressionable minor leaguers, including one of Boston’s top prospects. Third baseman Bobby Dalbec, a 23-year-old fourth-rounder from 2016 who ascended to Double-A in 2018, tied for the lead among all minor leaguers with 67 combined home runs (32) and doubles (35). For years, players talked about “selling out for power,” sacrificing contact to take big swings. Dalbec turns that expression around. “I think it’s a waste of an at-bat for me to sell out for contact, hit a ground ball early in the count,” he says.

Dalbec wants to hit the ball hard and far, but he also wants to be smart about it. “Being on the right attack angle [and] trying to match the plane to the pitch is something I really want to get better at,” he says. “It’s definitely nice to be able to watch guys in my organization at the major-league level do that.” Although he notes that he’s nowhere near Martinez’s level, he’d like to learn from hitters like him and Betts. “If they’d be willing to or if they had time, I’d pick their brains all day about it,” he says. Fortunately for him, Martinez always has time to talk hitting.","Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox waits at bat against the New York Mets on March 9 in Fort Myers, Florida.

83,How Mookie Betts Built a Better Swing,Travis Sawchik,"Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox waits at bat against the New York Mets on March 9 in Fort Myers, Florida. Michael Reaves/Getty Images

The following essay is adapted from The MVP Machine: How Baseball’s New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players, out now from Basic Books.

April 16, 2018, was an off day in Los Angeles for the Boston Red Sox. But for outfielder Mookie Betts, there would be no rest.

Boston hitting coach Tim Hyers suggested to Betts that he spend the day working with the silver-haired, blue-eyed Doug Latta, a self-described swing whisperer. On that Monday morning, Latta drove to the team hotel and picked up Betts, who brought with him a couple of his personalized Axe Bats, which feature handles shaped like that of a hatchet. They drove to a facility Latta occasionally used that was closer to Anaheim than his own Los Angeles headquarters: the covered batting cages at Anteater Ballpark, home of the UC–Irvine college baseball team, whose coach was a friend.

The 25-year-old Betts was coming off an excellent 2017 season, albeit a disappointing one for him. His .803 OPS (on-base plus slugging) was slightly above average but down significantly from his .897 mark the previous season. Many athletes are afraid to change. Betts wasn’t, even if that meant listening to the advice of an outside instructor like Latta, whose own playing career never advanced past junior college. Already a two-time All-Star, Betts wanted to be better.

Many of the hitters who had previously sought change were desperate, seeking to extend careers. But what if a top-shelf talent like Betts—renowned for his elite hand-eye coordination and athleticism and already experimenting with a nontraditional bat handle designed to enhance bat speed and control—adopted a better swing? What if stars started rethinking their potential and making large leaps?

Hyers joined the Red Sox after the 2017 season, following a two-year stint as the assistant hitting coach for the Dodgers. A Georgia native with a trace of a Southern accent, Hyers had a brief big-league career, batting .217 with two homers in 133 career games for the Padres, Marlins, and Tigers. He had been taught to swing down on the ball. He didn’t think he could be a power hitter. He thought his skill level was fixed.

Hyers sought out Latta late in the spring of 2016 after speaking with Dodgers infielder Justin Turner about the swing he learned from Latta. They met for breakfast one morning in the suburb of Silver Lake. The meeting lasted four hours.

Up to that point, few professional coaches had accepted Latta into their circles of trust. He was perceived as an unwelcome outsider who meddled with other coaches’ players. But as Boston’s charter arrived in Los Angeles on that early season road trip, Hyers wanted “another set of eyes”—Latta’s eyes—on a swing Betts had begun to forge that spring. Latta was a master at understanding how every part of the body worked in concert.

As Latta drove Betts to the UC–Irvine baseball facility, he asked him if he was sure he wanted to exert himself. Betts had been out of the lineup Sunday after injuring his left foot in a collision at home plate the day before. He said he was fine, and X-rays were negative. So they went to work as Latta does with almost every hitter. “We want the hand path to work and get length,” said Latta of creating an upswing with extension, “to get the body balanced and move forward.”

They worked together in private for several hours in open-air cages covered by hunter-green corrugated metal. The next day, Betts returned to the lineup against the Angels’ rookie sensation Shohei Ohtani. Betts batted first, where he had taken the vast majority of his at-bats as a big leaguer. At 5-foot-9, 180 pounds, he had the body of a leadoff hitter in addition to elite hand-eye ability. He had shown surprising power. That threat was about to become even more significant.

In the Anaheim twilight, Ohtani threw a full-count fastball that came close to the plate, knee-high. A keen observer could have noticed that Betts’s swing—already much changed that spring under Hyers’ instruction—looked different. As Ohtani delivered, Betts lifted his left leg and began his stride toward the pitcher. His hands dropped lower, toward his belt. As he moved forward, his hands stayed back and “under” the ball, as Latta teaches, which would enable his bat to travel on an uppercut trajectory. Pitches travel at downward angles, both because they’re released from an elevated mound and because gravity acts upon them. A flat bat path is on plane with a pitch for a very short period of time. An upward path increases the odds of optimum contact.

In a blur, the barrel connected with the Ohtani pitch and drove it high into the violet sky, the silhouette of the San Gabriel Mountains still visible in the distance. Rather than wrapping around his back as it often did, Betts’s follow-through traveled on a path that finished high and slightly above his shoulders. It was almost like a golfer’s swing—or like Turner’s.

The ball traveled 411 feet, landing beyond the left-center-field fence and ricocheting off the faux boulders and back onto the field. Betts ran around the bases, businesslike. No smile cracked his countenance.

When Betts came up in the third inning, Luke Bard had replaced Ohtani. Bard’s second pitch to Betts was a hanging slider. Betts again dropped his hands lower. His bat got on plane with the pitch earlier, and he drove slightly under and through the ball with lightning-quick hands. He again finished higher in his follow-through. Betts launched the ball beyond the bullpens in left-center field, 417 feet away from home plate. He lowered his head and subtly flipped his bat.

In the eighth inning, Betts faced Cam Bedrosian. As the temperature dropped throughout the evening, Betts blew on his hands prior to grasping his Axe Bat and stepping back into the right-handed batter’s box. Bedrosian’s first pitch was an inside fastball. Betts swung, making contact well out in front of the plate, where most home-run contact happens. The ball soared toward center field. This time Betts watched it briefly, and a small grin appeared. The ball landed on an AstroTurf knoll beyond the playing surface, 427 feet away: his third home run of the game. And on May 2, Betts would author another three-homer game.

Betts was following the trail blazed before him by a select group of hitters, including one Latta had helped transform from a castoff into a star.

On Sept. 6, 2013, Turner, then a New York Mets utility infielder, borrowed the bat of teammate Lucas Duda and walked into the on-field batting cage at Progressive Field in downtown Cleveland. It was the beginning of one of the most unthinkable transformations in modern baseball history.

Turner’s former Mets teammate, Marlon Byrd, had been traded a week earlier to the Pirates. Turner and Byrd had spoken often about hitting. The public was suspicious of Byrd’s 2013 breakout because Byrd had been suspended for 50 games in 2012 after testing positive for a banned substance that masks steroid use. (Byrd would retire in 2016 after testing positive for a banned substance again.) But Turner—and another light-hitting Mets infielder named Daniel Murphy—listened to Byrd in 2013 because Byrd had changed his approach to hitting in a way that had nothing to do with drugs.

Byrd was 6 feet tall with a 245-pound frame, and yet prior to 2013, he had been a ground-ball hitter. “I came from more of an old-school style of baseball,” Byrd told Travis in 2013. “Coming up, the coaches I had played for in the 1970s and 1980s, they were taught to swing down.”

Byrd’s breakout 2013 season, which featured career-bests in home runs (22) and slugging percentage (.526), came at an age, 36, when players are typically in decline. His preceding suspension made the stats look like a chemical mirage, but in a single offseason, Byrd had changed the nature of how he swung and the angle at which his bat struck the ball.

Byrd and Turner conversed during batting practice, during games, and on late-night charter flights as they crisscrossed the country to fulfill the demands of the major-league schedule.

Turner was intrigued by Byrd’s radical new theories of hitting. Byrd spoke about how Latta had helped him adopt a leg kick and more loft in his swing the previous winter. As a result, he was more direct in his movement to the pitch. Turner knew Byrd had decreased his ground-ball rate from 49.6 percent in 2012 (which was near his career rate) to 39.2 percent in 2013, while raising his fly-ball rate by 12.2 percentage points, the third-greatest increase in baseball. Professional batters take tens of thousands of swings between when they first pick up a bat and when they make it to pro ball, hardwiring a swing path into their muscle memory. Most coaches thought that trait couldn’t be changed. Byrd challenged that notion, suggesting that hitters could evolve, and relatively quickly, even at advanced ages.

Byrd embraced a style completely different from what Mets hitting instructor Dave Hudgens advocated. (Hudgens would later adjust his beliefs when he became the Astros’ hitting coach.) Early that spring, Byrd launched ball after ball out of a spring training backfield at the club’s Port St. Lucie complex. The Mets’ staff told him his new swing wouldn’t work in games. He was sure they were wrong. Hitters were taught that home runs were blissful accidents, and that they ought to try for low line drives. Byrd believed in trying to hit home runs in games and in practice. He was done with conventional wisdom.

Turner had not homered in his 183 plate appearances in 2013, and he started Sept. 6 with a .639 OPS, well below the league average. He was a bench player known for his glove, shock of red hair, and amber beard. But on this midafternoon in Cleveland prior to a 7:05 p.m. game, Turner tried on a new identity.

Duda’s bat was an inch longer and an ounce heavier than his own model—34 inches, 33 ounces—which is why Turner chose it. Maybe it would help him generate more power. As he entered the on-field batting cage to begin his experiment, he thought about what Byrd had preached: “Take a large stride. Gain ground.” In other words, move toward the pitcher, creating a more linear path that would transfer energy more efficiently. Byrd also harped on contact point, explaining that batters should think about catching the pitch out in front of the plate, whereas most traditional teaching held that batters should let the ball travel longer and deeper, closer to the plate. Catching the ball out front would better organize the body and allow for the ball to be pulled into the air: the most valuable batted-ball type in baseball. In 2018, MLB batters hit .565 with a 1.267 slugging mark on pull-side air balls, and 32.7 percent of such batted balls went for home runs.

All his life, Turner had been told to let the ball travel as deep as possible and to try to hit low line drives. Now, Turner, who would turn 29 in November, was ready to experiment. He knew the Mets might not tender him a contract after the season. If he wanted to play more, or at all, he had to change. He had to hit.

All his life, Turner had been told to hit low line drives. Now, he was ready to experiment.

Turner had studied kinesiology at Cal State–Fullerton, where he hit seven home runs in 1,008 at-bats. While Byrd’s theories made sense, Turner didn’t think he could become a home-run hitter. He had hit just six home runs over parts of five major-league seasons. But unlike Betts, he had little to lose. He traded in a fixed mindset for a growth one.

“I was thinking, I’m just going to try and catch the ball as far out as I can in batting practice,” Turner says.

Only a few saw the beginning. They saw Turner connect with pitches that began to fly over the 19-foot, left field wall. The clank of balls against empty bleachers resonated throughout the mostly empty ballpark. It was a sound Turner was not accustomed to creating. Teammates raised eyebrows.

“I didn’t even feel like I was swinging hard,” Turner says. “I was like, ‘this is amazing.’ ”

In his first two at-bats on Sept. 6, Turner grounded out versus Scott Kazmir. But in the top of the seventh, he faced right-handed reliever Cody Allen. A paltry crowd of 15,962 watched as Turner caught an elevated fastball well out in front of the plate.

The feeling of hitting a home run was alien to Turner. He ran out of the box. His attention was fixed on Cleveland center fielder Michael Bourn, who raced backward. “Get over his head! Get over his head!” Turner exclaimed in his head, his heart hammering as he approached first base, the ball he had struck still hanging in the air. Turner was as astonished as anyone when the ball vanished into a row of trees beyond the center-field fence.

“I was like, ‘oh my God, what just happened?’ ” Turner says. “I didn’t hit enough home runs to know what it was like when I got it.”

Turner floated around the bases, trying to keep his composure, trying to be emotionless, acting as if he had been there before. Except that he hadn’t been there before. His teammates were slack-jawed. “Swaggy,” as Turner was nicknamed, did that? Following the game, Turner met his then–girlfriend, now wife, at the Jack Casino in downtown Cleveland. Under the lights, above the din of the casino, Turner couldn’t stop talking about what he felt and what he might have found.

Two days later, the Mets and Turner faced the Indians and hard-throwing rookie Danny Salazar on a sunny Sunday afternoon. During his second at-bat, with the count three balls and one strike, Salazar challenged Turner with an elevated 96mph fastball. Turner caught the pitch out in front of the plate. The ball soared on a majestic trajectory, landing halfway up the sun-soaked, left-center-field bleachers. It was as if Roy Hobbs had stolen Turner’s jersey and hit right-handed.

For the eighth time in his career—and the second time in three days— Turner circled the bases.

Turner played in 10 games with the new swing that September. In that limited sample, he batted .387 and slugged .677. He knew he needed to visit Doug Latta.

Amid the urban sprawl of Northridge, California, close to a Costco, a mobile home park, and an In-N-Out Burger, is a long, narrow business park that terminates near a set of railroad tracks. In one of the business park’s long, narrow units, Latta transforms hitters.

Inside Latta’s facility, the Ball Yard, are two batting cages, a couple of couches, a half bathroom, and a kitchenette. Everything one needs to hit for hours. Outside the main batting cage is a large television whose screen Latta has covered with a clear sheet of plastic so he can pause video and use marker to scribble over the image, identifying flaws—his homemade Telestrator. It is a modest, white-drywalled space with a green AstroTurf floor, but as Latta tells hitters who might be expecting a more lavish facility when they first walk in, “We don’t need much space to get better.” The same goes for any hotbed of talent development: All that’s required are ideas, information, passion, and reps. Lots and lots of reps. The Ball Yard was where, in the winter of 2013–2014, Latta helped Turner morph from a journeyman into a something more.

At the Ball Yard in 2018, Latta scrolls through his video library, finds some early footage of Turner, and plays it on the flat-screen television outside the batting cage. It’s from Jan. 27, 2014.

Turner was unemployed then. He’d been nontendered by the Mets. On the video, Turner has a shorter beard and wears a T-shirt, shorts, and a hat turned backward. He takes a swing. He goes into his leg kick and takes an exaggerated stride.

“This is before he narrowed up,” Latta says of Turner’s stance. “Those days we were just pumping.”

By “pumping,” Latta means taking a lot of swings. Latta pulls up another video of Turner from April 24, 2014, after Turner had signed a minor-league deal with the Dodgers with an invite to spring training—and ended up making the team as a replacement for the recently retired Michael Young. Turner was still a part-time player. In the clip, his hands are higher than they were in January. So is his leg kick. He looks off-balance several times, finishing with his feet out of the would-be batter’s box as he gathers himself. As he swings, he rocks his weight on his back leg, which is a no-no for Latta.

“People forget that’s how J.T. looked then,” Latta says. “He’s gotten narrower, the leg kicks up more. It got easier and easier and easier.”

Latta and Turner weren’t alone. Byrd was often there also, hitting and serving as something of a quasi–assistant coach.

“It was hard. It was tough. I had 25 years of habits to break,” Turner says. “Marlon had talked about it all year long, so I kind of had a head start going in there, knowing what [Latta] was talking about.”

Over that winter, Turner trained at the Ball Yard for three months, four days a week. He and Latta worked for three hours per session, taking seven or eight rounds of batting practice per hour, 15 to 20 pitches per round. He estimates that he took 20,000 swings.

Latta has documented Turner’s entire evolution. Since that winter, most of their interaction has come through texting, though Turner sometimes stops by the Ball Yard for a tune-up. Latta interacts with clients he has less familiarity with through FaceTime. He watches most of Turner’s at-bats live. At first, Latta sent constant reinforcements. If he saw footage of Babe Ruth’s swing on MLB Network or elsewhere, he’d capture it and send it to Turner. Ruth had a narrow stance with an exaggerated stride. He contacted the ball out front. His back foot left contact with the ground. Turner laughed about the Ruth video during spring training 2018.

“ ‘Look at Babe, he’s really staying back and catching the ball deep,’ ” Turner said, recounting the text from Latta that accompanied the video. Ruth did the exact opposite of the conventional teaching Latta and Turner were mocking, complete with an uppercut swing.

“You look at Ruth, Mantle, all these hitters back in the day, they all leg kick or toe tap. They all gain a ton of ground. Their strides are huge. … It’s the theory that whatever starts in motion, stays in motion. … Isaac Newton is my favorite hitting coach. The whole old-school mentality of swinging down, chopping down on the ball? It’s bullshit.”

Turner slammed the table with a fist in frustration. How many coaches had let down how many players?

In 2014, Turner hit .340/.404/.493. He made only 322 plate appearances, but among all hitters with at least 300 trips to the plate, his 158 weighted runs created plus (wRC+), a comprehensive rate stat, ranked ninth (100 is league average). The Dodgers were curious enough to retain the arbitration-eligible Turner on a one-year, $2.5 million deal. In 2015, he made 439 plate appearances and hit nearly as well as he had the year before, slashing .294/.370/.491 with a 141 wRC+. Between 2013 and 2015, he cut his ground-ball rate by 12.5 percentage points, the fourth-greatest decline in the game. In 2016, Turner earned a full-time role. He hit 27 homers. After that season, he signed a four-year, $64 million contract with the Dodgers.

In the summer of 2018 at the Ball Yard, Latta pulls up another evolution-of-Turner video from January 2017. By now, Turner is much narrower in his stance. There is no rocking back on his back leg to move forward. As his left leg lifts to initiate his swing, his hands fall to create the proper slot for an uppercut swing.

“What’s J.T. trying to create? Balance and drive,” Latta says.

Latta plays it again in slow motion. Turner’s back leg and shoulder remain perfectly in line. There is no backward weight transfer or movement. He’s balanced. He lands with his front (left) leg well in front of his body. His hands are lowered and ready to fire. “Body is moving in concert,” Latta says. “From this position he fires right underneath. He picks up his backside, and all that energy drives through the ball. He gets what we call a lot of extension.” In slow motion, the swing finishes. Latta outlines the path of the upswing with marker on the plastic sheet covering the television screen. He notes that all of Turner’s energy is transferred to a contact area in front of the plate.

Latta has a HitTrax radar unit to measure launch angle and exit velocity, but he rarely employs the latest technological advances. If a hitter doesn’t have timing and balance and movement, he has no shot, Latta believes. He’s troubled by the teaching he sees on social media, where video clips focus on creating exit velocity at the expense of balance and adaptable swings. Latta rarely uses the words swing or swing plane when talking about hitters. He tries to organize the body in such a way that the swing takes care of itself. He believes that some in the independent-player-development business are more worried about selling products than helping athletes.

Ground zero of the fly-ball revolution was arguably the Ball Yard, where other teachers and advocates of the movement met and discussed ideas. Byrd spread the knowledge to Turner and Murphy in New York. (Murphy hit 62 homers in more than 3,300 at-bats through age 30, and then hit 60 more in fewer than 1,400 at-bats from ages 31 to 33.) Turner now proselytizes in the Dodgers clubhouse, teaching or reinforcing the beliefs of talented young hitters like Cody Bellinger and Corey Seager, and even influencing some hitting instructors like Hyers. When Bellinger was having trouble with sliders as a rookie in 2017, he wondered if his swing was too uppercut-oriented. Turner had him play a game late that summer. They went into the team’s indoor batting cage at Dodger Stadium. Turner turned on the slider machine and told Bellinger to try to swing and miss below the sliders. Bellinger couldn’t do it; he couldn’t miss. Bellinger produced a .418 weighted on-base average (wOBA) versus sliders in 2017 and a .341 mark in 2018, easily eclipsing the league averages of .271 and .263, respectively. His upswing worked.

The fly-ball revolution also spread thanks to Statcast, which in 2015 began to measure the launch angle and exit velocity of almost every ball hit in every MLB game. Teams started to outfit their batting cages at all levels with swing- and ball-tracking technology. The data confirmed that air balls were better than grounders: With every 10-degree increment from minus 30 degrees to 30 degrees (where zero is a level line drive), the leaguewide wOBA on contact in 2018 increased, easily surpassing the all-angles average of .315. (The average home run left the bat at a vertical angle of 28.2 degrees.)

-30 to -20: .050 -20 to -10: .188 -10 to 0: .245 0 to 10: .462 10 to 20: .712 20 to 30: .731

Between growing awareness of that relationship and a still-unexplained change in the composition of the official MLB ball in 2015, which caused balls in the air to carry farther, hitters had more incentive to swing up. The average launch angle of a batted ball has increased in every year of Statcast: from 10.5 degrees in 2015, to 10.8 in 2016, 11.1 in 2017, and 11.7 in 2018. Over the same span, the rate of balls hit at a 10-degree angle or higher has increased by 3.3 percentage points. According to data from Baseball Prospectus, the leaguewide ground-ball rate in 2018 was the lowest on record, going back to 1950.

In 2017, MLB hitters launched 6,105 home runs, breaking the previous record (set in 2000) by 412. That year, 2018, and 2016, respectively, featured the three highest rates of home runs per fair batted ball in history, surpassing the so-called steroid era.

“Elevate and celebrate” and “Ground balls suck” became batting-cage cries. In 2018, Red Sox skipper Alex Cora said, “We don’t like hitting ground balls. We like hitting the ball in the air.” His statement mirrored a Cubs catchphrase—“There’s no slug on the ground”—as well as Pirates manager Clint Hurdle’s advice to his team: “Your OPS is in the air.” An outsider philosophy had spawned insider slogans.

Latta didn’t set out to change baseball. He simply loved the game. He grew up in what he describes as “tough” financial circumstances and didn’t play organized baseball until he reached high school. Instead he played in a sandlot down the street in his childhood Koreatown neighborhood, where he and his friends used the back of an accommodating neighbor’s garage as a backstop. He went on to play at Los Angeles City College, a public community college, and later Cal Lutheran. After college he joined the Pasadena Redbirds, an adult hardball league.

“The challenge was always there to be able to build myself, to get better, and to realize that you could beat the odds,” Latta says. “We were playing major-league-caliber pitchers—like Ed Farmer, Jerry Reuss, Craig Chamberlain—so we were getting challenged.”

Latta turned down a chance to play in the Mexican League. He already had a better-paying job: At 19, Latta had begun his own business cleaning private swimming pools. He continued to play baseball for the Redbirds until 1995. During his time with the team, he met a professional scout named Craig Wallenbrock. They developed a friendship. Latta describes Wallenbrock as “a thinking man.” Wallenbrock was a devoted reader, and he applied his studies to baseball, giving private hitting lessons beginning in the late 1980s.

“Elevate and celebrate” and “Ground balls suck” became batting-cage cries.

While his playing days were over by the late ’90s, Latta thought he had information to share. He also had space to share. He owned part of a large industrial building in Los Angeles, where he stored pool chemicals for what was then a state-of-the-art chlorine-injection system. When he had an opportunity to buy the other half of the industrial structure, Latta had an idea: He would build an indoor batting cage in the other half of the building. He could give lessons and rent out the cages. He named the facility the Ball Yard.

“We didn’t even have any indoor batting cages in the area,” Latta says. “They just did not exist.”

Latta spent four months personally doing the demolition of what had been office space. He installed AstroTurf and batting cages. Wallenbrock asked if he could hold some of his hitting sessions there. Another instructor was interested in using the space, but that instructor wanted to use “flat-bat stuff,” Latta recalls. “I told myself, hell no.” Wallenbrock was more aligned with Latta’s philosophy, so they reached an agreement for Wallenbrock to train hitters in his space. No hitter was ever taught to chop wood, swing down on the ball, or hit grounders at the Ball Yard, Latta says. Wallenbrock brought in a great number of hitters, including some major leaguers.

The Ball Yard began to host regular meetings with other hitting coaches inside and outside professional baseball, which Latta labels a think tank. Latta kept about 30 folding chairs on hand for the sessions, which grew in size and frequency. The attendees talked about hitting philosophies, some of them out of favor or forgotten like those of the great Ted Williams, who was hitting fly balls before they were cool. “If you get the ball into the air with power, you have the gift to produce the most important hit in baseball: the home run. … For those purposes, I advocate a slight upswing,” wrote Williams in his 1970 book The Science of Hitting. Former major leaguer turned instructor Don Slaught was a frequent visitor, as was Greg Walker, who had served as a hitting coach with the White Sox and Braves. The group met for years.

“I like to say that was my graduate work,” Latta says, “working side by side with Craig for 14 years seeing what [pro hitters] were going through. How do you buy that experience?”

Eventually, Wallenbrock and Latta had a falling-out, and Wallenbrock took his higher-profile clients elsewhere. Latta moved into a new facility, the present-day Ball Yard. Years went by. Latta continued to teach his unusual, uppercut-swing philosophy to players, mostly local college and high-school kids. And one day in the fall of 2012, Marlon Byrd walked through Latta’s door looking for a place to hit in the offseason. Byrd became his first major-league client.

On Feb. 6, 2017, Travis published an article at FanGraphs entitled, “Can More Hitters Get Off the Ground?” Fly-ball and line-drive rates had remained stable from 2012 to 2016, through the depths of baseball’s offensive depression, when a pair of low-power teams in the Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants accounted for three World Series titles in five years. In 2014, before the altered ball took flight, teams averaged only 4.07 runs scored per game, the lowest total in a nonstrike season since 1976, and both MLB insiders and fans fretted about how offense could be boosted in a high-velocity era. A few minutes after the story, which quoted Latta, was published online, Latta received a call from Hyers.

“At 7:32 a.m. Tim called me and said, ‘Andrew Friedman just called me about that article,’ ” Latta says. “The president of the Dodgers. Wow. Cool. I had told [Hyers] it was coming out. ‘Friedman got in the office and read it,’ [Hyers said]. I was like, wow, Friedman reads FanGraphs. He had no heads up. For him to get in and read it in two minutes, you never actually know who is paying attention.”

The article created debate within the Dodgers’ hitting circles, which included both more traditionally minded voices like the club’s head hitting coach, Turner Ward, and others like Wallenbrock, who had worked with the club as a consultant, and his understudy Robert Van Scoyoc, who was named as the Dodgers’ hitting coach after the 2018 season. The fly-ball revolution, and the rethinking of development as a whole, had first spread from player to player via word of mouth. Now teams wanted to disseminate it throughout their entire organizations.

For decades, coaches—always ex-professional players—had enjoyed a privileged place in the vertical hierarchy of teaching and decision-making. But more and more coaches were being questioned and challenged. Many were soon to be replaced. Ideas that had begun outside the game were trickling up into the professional ranks. Latta was just one garage startup disrupting the industry.

At the end of 2017, Hyers joined the Red Sox as their head hitting coach. He and the Sox sought to revamp their hitting philosophy. Another new face, J.D. Martinez, was told by the Red Sox coaching staff to make Mookie his “project.” As Martinez watched Betts hit for the first time in the spring with his 2017 stroke, he said, “I don’t know that that’s going to work.” Betts was not offended. He wanted information.

Martinez signed a five-year $110 million deal with the Red Sox over the winter of 2017–2018, several years after reinventing his own swing and saving his career. Through 2013, Martinez had been a replacement-level big leaguer. In his first three years in the majors, he posted an 87 wRC+. He was a below-average hitter and a poor defender. He career was in jeopardy.

“You still talk to coaches, ‘Oh, you want a line drive right up the middle. Right off the back of the L-screen,’ ” Martinez told Travis in 2017. “OK, well that’s a fucking single.”

Martinez began to question why his best swing would result in a “fucking single.” The same winter as Turner, he sought a new swing. He found it in a facility in suburban Los Angeles with assistance from Wallenbrock and his protégé Van Scoyoc.

“I have this little theory,” Martinez says. “When I think about the best players, I think what makes people so good is when they have that insecurity about themselves … because they don’t want to fall off. It keeps them working. I feel like [Betts] had that little doubt. … Other guys have good years and they won’t make the change. He was like, ‘Dude, I have to figure this out. I don’t have it figured out.’ ”

Betts’ overhaul worked from the bottom up, too. Hyers and Martinez first stressed how his feet interacted with the ground. That was where the kinetic chain of the swing began. “I had to fix the ground before I fixed my hands,” Martinez says. “The engine is down there.” The Red Sox now travel with force plates that measure ground- interaction forces. The portable devices are set up in the tunnels of MLB stadiums so that hitters can measure their force and balance. They look something like large digital scales and, like TrackMan, were first popularized in golf. Betts had never thought about using the ground.

“He’d just been hitting away his whole life and didn’t think much of it,” Hyers says.

“Other guys have good years and they won’t make the change. [Betts] was like, ‘Dude, I have to figure this out. I don’t have it figured out.’ ” — J.D. Martinez

Like Turner in Los Angeles, Martinez is something of a Johnny Appleswing, a willing teacher and a clubhouse peer who reinforces Hyers’s philosophy. Among the 260 MLB hitters with at least 150 batted balls in both 2017 and 2018, Betts, center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr., and shortstop Xander Bogaerts ranked fourth, eighth, and 11th in year-to-year increase in hard-hit rate (the percentage of balls hit 95 mph or faster). Betts, Bogaerts, and Bradley also ranked first, second, and 30th, respectively, in year-to-year increase in barrels (a Statcast term for “balls someone hit the snot out of”) per batted ball.

“I have to give a big credit to J.D. Martinez,” Hyers says. “When you have a superstar and you have a guy who’s already proven it, to come in and back what you’re saying and have those conversations one-on-one with players. … J.D. was huge on saying, ‘Hey Mookie, you can do this part.’ And they had their own private conversations that helped a ton also.”

Now Betts has become a hitting tastemaker, too, inspiring rivals to reject the round knob at a time when some bat companies, like golf-club designers, have begun to use swing sensors to determine the perfect fit for each player in length, weight, and grip. “You start seeing that [Betts] has an influence within the league,” says Axe Bat’s Trevor Stocking. “[George] Springer asked him for a bat, and now all of a sudden Springer’s swinging Mookie’s bat, so now Springer is giving the bat to another player, and [it’s] kind of this wheel … where they’re passing on the equipment.”

They’re also passing on the swing, and hitters are getting off the ground younger. Byrd bought into fly balls at the tail end of his career. Turner saw the light just prior to turning 30. Martinez and Betts made the change in their primes. Now they’re modeling good batter behavior for impressionable minor leaguers, including one of Boston’s top prospects. Third baseman Bobby Dalbec, a 23-year-old fourth-rounder from 2016 who ascended to Double-A in 2018, tied for the lead among all minor leaguers with 67 combined home runs (32) and doubles (35). For years, players talked about “selling out for power,” sacrificing contact to take big swings. Dalbec turns that expression around. “I think it’s a waste of an at-bat for me to sell out for contact, hit a ground ball early in the count,” he says.

Dalbec wants to hit the ball hard and far, but he also wants to be smart about it. “Being on the right attack angle [and] trying to match the plane to the pitch is something I really want to get better at,” he says. “It’s definitely nice to be able to watch guys in my organization at the major-league level do that.” Although he notes that he’s nowhere near Martinez’s level, he’d like to learn from hitters like him and Betts. “If they’d be willing to or if they had time, I’d pick their brains all day about it,” he says. Fortunately for him, Martinez always has time to talk hitting.","Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox waits at bat against the New York Mets on March 9 in Fort Myers, Florida.
Boston hitting coach Tim Hyers suggested to Betts that he spend the day working with the silver-haired, blue-eyed Doug Latta, a self-described swing whisperer.
But as Boston’s charter arrived in Los Angeles on that early season road trip, Hyers wanted “another set of eyes”—Latta’s eyes—on a swing Betts had begun to forge that spring.
As Latta drove Betts to the UC–Irvine baseball facility, he asked him if he was sure he wanted to exert himself.

84,The new Jumanji video game had better transport me to a magical jungle adventure.,Matthew Dessem,"Karen Gillen and The Rock explore the mysterious Uncanny Valley. Sony

Jumanji, Chris Van Allsburg’s hauntingly illustrated children’s book about a jungle-themed board game that comes to life, has had a lot of incarnations since its original publication in 1981. There was the original book, the 1995 film adaptation with Robin Williams and a very young Kirsten Dunst, the 1995 Milton Bradley board game, Van Allsburg’s 2002 outer-space-themed sequel Zathura, Jon Favreau’s 2005 film adaption Zathura: A Space Adventure, and of course, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle with the Rock, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What’s the one thing all of these Jumanji-related media have in common? They have utterly failed to magically transport me to a whimsical but still mildly-threatening jungle fantasyland to take part in a thrilling adventure. No stampedes, monsoons, or lions have unexpectedly appeared in any of my residences between 1981 and today, no matter which Jumanji-related products I purchased.

Worse still, representatives from Houghton Mifflin, TriStar Pictures, Milton-Bradley, Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures, the and the Los Angeles Zoo have stopped responding to my letters about this wholly unacceptable situation. Anyway, it looks like Sony is taking one last shot at living up to decades of broken promises with a video game adaptation of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.

85,Cognitive behavioral therapy doesn’t fix everything for everyone.,Hayden Shelby,"Lisa Larson-Walker

A few weeks ago, I made an appointment with a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy—CBT as it’s known to professionals and those of us who have way too much contact with the mental health care system. After months of struggling to find the right doctor and to get on a medication regime that could tamp down the worst of the physical pain that accompanies my condition, I had finally found the right medical mix and was feeling stable. But I still had some lingering negative thought patterns I wanted to kick, precisely the kind of thing CBT is supposed to be good for, which is why I scheduled the appointment. I went in expecting some helpful worksheets and mental exercises.

What I got was a therapist who, after doing a cursory intake evaluation, declared, “If you really want to get better, you’re going to have to get off those medications and put in the work.”

This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened to me. A couple of months prior, desperate and unable to eat or sleep, I had gone to a psychiatric hospital. I knew from experience that it was time to make a significant medication change, and I expressed this to the nurse practitioner handling my case. She came back with the recommendation of a three-week course of intensive outpatient CBT. I pleaded to talk to the attending psychiatrist, who thankfully agreed with my own assessment and got me on the track to recovery.

This whole course of events had been kicked off much earlier at an appointment with my then-psychiatrist—I had gone to him certain that the medicine I was on was “pooping out,” a well-documented but little understood phenomenon I typically experience every few years, in which a previously reliable medication just stops doing the trick. I’ve always solved this problem by rotating to another drug. But this time my doctor resisted. He had been reading up on CBT and was convinced that if I worked hard to change patterns in my thoughts, I could learn to control the problematic feedback loop between my brain and body. He insisted I try CBT before switching meds. I elected to find a new psychiatrist, a process that took weeks—long enough for me to spiral down into a hole I’m just now climbing out of.

As it happened, I had already done a variant of CBT a few years earlier, in the hopes of getting some tools to cope with the stresses of moving to a new city and starting grad school. I’d pursued this type of therapy instead of a medication adjustment because the anxiety I was feeling had a clear object (something CBT is designed to address), and the sensations attached to it were quite different from those I experience when my mental illness is taking hold. Years of dealing with this condition have made me able to discern the difference between normal and pathological psychic pain in the same way that, as an athlete, I’ve learned to differentiate between minor aches and pains and a serious injury. Both need to be tended to, as the former can make you more vulnerable to the latter, but the treatments are different. As it turned out, for me, CBT techniques proved to be lesser tools for managing stress than my tried-and-true regimen of dance classes and long runs.

I began to ponder my recent interactions with the mental health care system upon reading a recent New York Times Magazine story about severely anxious teens. The article contains most of the standard hand-wringing the Times has been putting out over how anxiety is America’s national mood and how we’ve become “the United States of Xanax.” But I was most struck by a subnarrative that speaks to my experiences with many care providers, as well as broader beliefs I fear are spreading as CBT is having its cultural moment.

The New York Times Magazine story highlights a young man, Jake, who suffers from paralyzing anxiety. When medication just “made a bad situation worse,” his parents sent him to an in-patient treatment center that practices CBT. There, he retrained his brain—“cognitive restructuring” in CBT lingo—and faced his fears through exposure therapy. The author and the clinicians he interviewed describe the therapy as “work” that is “uncomfortable.” At one point a woman in the piece describes an anxious teen doing an exposure exercise as “brave.” For Jake, in the end, this work pays off, and he goes off to college with a newfound control over his life and mind.

But Jake has a foil in this story. It’s a young woman, Jillian, who goes through the same treatment as Jake, but with different results. Her anxieties return, she leaves high school, battles with her mother, and falters in her use of the CBT tools she learned because “it’s exhausting.” When we last see Jillian, she is in her “messy” room, where she chats on her phone and ignores the schedule she is supposed to keep. Beside her sit the bottles of pills that she “believes” make her better than she would be otherwise. The subtle ways in which we are led to question Jillian, not CBT, struck me as unsettling.

In fact, highlighting one teen that benefits from CBT and one that doesn’t would be a fairly accurate representation of larger trends. According to a study cited in the story, CBT showed about the same rate of effectiveness in treating anxiety and depression as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibiting, or SSRI, medication—a little more than 50 percent—with better results when combined. In the thorny world of mental illnesses, these are good outcomes for both modes of treatment. The Times story isn’t celebrating the effectiveness of SSRIs, though. Why highlight CBT? Because unlike medication, it’s not just effective; it’s also virtuous.

You might say my story is the opposite of Jake’s. I’ve tried numerous forms of therapy, from traditional counseling to hypnosis, and yes, at this point, a couple attempts at CBT. I’ll probably keep trying new forms of therapy. But thus far, none have been able to replace—or, to be honest, even augment—medication. I’ve also always experienced an element of moralizing around therapy by health care professionals. As therapy has become more acceptable in the broader culture, it has also come to be expected of people who take medication to control disorders. As one general practitioner at my university chided while making me promise to see a counselor along with a psychiatrist, “you have to do your part.” But while a moralizing rhetoric runs through many types of therapy, CBT’s is a particularly virulent strain.

The first element of CBT’s moral claim lies in its identity as an evidence-based intervention, bolstered by the existence of a great deal of data to show its effectiveness. On its own, this is a positive development in psychotherapy. However, just because CBT might, on aggregate, be as effective as many drugs does not mean that it will be as effective as medication for any given individual. This subtle point is missed by some practitioners.

The main aspect of CBT’s moral superiority, however, lies in its purported strength: It places the patient in the driver’s seat of the therapeutic process; the therapist is conceived of as more of a coach. In fact, the latest movement in CBT even removes the therapist altogether. This “self-help” CBT assists patients through online guides and apps. And self-help accurately describes the way CBT is frequently packaged—with pure positivity and a can-do ethic. The “work” of getting better is up to the patient, who is responsible for her own success.

This characterization sets up a scary flip side. When medications don’t work, the fault is that of the pill. When traditional talk therapy doesn’t work, you can blame a “poor fit” or a lack of chemistry. But in CBT, failure redounds to the individual. The cumulative message I’ve gotten about CBT amounts to: It’s effective, so it should work, and if it doesn’t work, it’s because you didn’t try hard enough.

But managing mental illness is always hard work, no matter how you do it. Navigating the health care system while in a state of distress is hard. Convincing providers to take seriously the urgency of a pain that has no observable physical manifestation is hard. And doing this while being told that you’re not putting in enough effort of your own is really hard. Like many people who take psychotropic drugs, I hate being on them. Relying on mind-altering substances to function produces no small amount of shame, not to mention existential anxiety. I’ve tried to go off them many times in the hopes that the “real me” will finally be able to stand on her own. Each time, I run into the heartbreaking reality that my unaltered self is too painful to bear.

The fact that CBT is helping people should be celebrated. But I need medication. And for me, the enthusiasm around CBT has prevented me from getting timely and appropriate treatment. It has also added a few bricks to the heavy burden I carry around about my inability to make myself better. That’s not fair to me, or to the other patients who are likely experiencing the same problems.

The core of CBT’s cognitive restructuring essentially amounts to rewriting the stories you tell yourself—if you can think about something differently, you can maybe shift the way it makes you feel. Perhaps it’s time to rewrite some of the stories we’re telling about CBT.","In fact, highlighting one teen that benefits from CBT and one that doesn’t would be a fairly accurate representation of larger trends.

86,An Insurer Just Squashed the Effort to Create a Public Option in Connecticut,Jordan Weissmann,"The CEO of Cigna reportedly killed off the effort to create a public option in Connecticut. Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images

Just last week, it seemed as if Connecticut might follow Washington’s footsteps and become the next state to pass some version of a public health insurance option. Gov. Ned Lamont and a group of Democrats lined up behind a bill that would create a new, government-backed insurance plan and offer subsidies to some families that don’t currently qualify for help under Obamacare. “This is a bill that gives us the best opportunity in a long time to expand access to people who don’t have access to affordable health care and to bring down the cost of health care,” Lamont said.

Now, following a swift and fierce pushback from the state’s powerful insurance industry, the effort appears to have collapsed. Connecticut Comptroller Kevin Lembo, whose office would have played a key roll in implementing the legislation, told the Hartford Courant Tuesday that the legislation was effectively dead after the CEO of Cigna, which is based in the state, suggested he would move the company elsewhere if the bill passed. According to Lembo, the insurance giant’s chief “threatened to send a public letter to Lamont that if the public option bill moves forward, ‘they would reconsider where they’re domiciled.’” Cigna’s spokesman “said the insurer lobbied hard against the bill, but denied that any threat was made.”

The insurance industry is a major employer in Connecticut and holds an enormous amount of political sway. But if Lembo’s description of what happened is true, it may be a preview of just how vicious any battle over federal health reform would be. I happened to be on the phone with a Connecticut state Sen. Matt Lesser to discuss the proposal when the news of its demise broke. As he explained it to me, the most recent version of the bill would have required insurers that sold any coverage on the state’s Obamacare exchanges to also offer a standard, state-designed health plan, called the Connecticut Option, structured to be 20 percent less expensive than other options on the market. The government would have assembled a network of providers willing to accept the new coverage, and provided some additional subsidies to households above and beyond what Obamacare offers. It was not a plan to push private carriers out of Connecticut’s individual insurance market, which is fairly small to begin with. We’re talking about very incremental change.

Nonetheless, a group of carriers wrote to Lamont last week urging him to kill the bill. It might not have posed any kind of serious danger to their bottom lines, but judging by the comptroller’s comments to the Courant, Cigna’s CEO at least seems to have viewed the fight as an early skirmish in a bigger national battle over health reform:

Lembo accused Cordani of acting more from political impulse than to protect his business. “This is not an existential threat to them,” he said. “It’s an ideological threat to the CEO of Cigna.”

That tracked with what Lesser told me earlier in the day when I asked him what he thought the bill’s chances of passing might be. At the time, he said it was 50-50. “We have an incredible amount of political support,” he told me. “But I don’t want to kid myself. We are a state that’s synonymous with the insurance industry. And there are some in the industry who are afraid that any health reform effort is a step down the path to their biggest fear, which is Medicare for all.”","The CEO of Cigna reportedly killed off the effort to create a public option in Connecticut.

87,The Department of Energy Is Now Calling Fossil Fuels “Molecules of Freedom” and “Freedom Gas”,Jordan Weissmann,"From now on this is known as a “freedom flame.” (It’s actually a natural gas flare in New Mexico.) Nick Oxford/Reuters

The Trump administration loves fossil fuels, but apparently has decided that they need some rebranding. Or so E&E News editor Ellen Gilmer discovered Tuesday when she opened up what should have been the world’s driest press release.

TFW you delete a DOE press release thinking it’s just another DOE press release. And then you realize it’s not just another DOE press release https://t.co/oY4XFRq9Q6 pic.twitter.com/Pbbo5JTgDO — Ellen M. Gilmer (@ellengilmer) May 29, 2019

That’s right. Hydrocarbons shall henceforth be known as “molecules of U.S. freedom.” Proud Americans are fracking compounds of liberty from the glorious shale beds of Texas and shipping it ‘round the world.

Anyway, it gets better. The actual news here is that the Department of Energy gave Houston-based Freeport LNG approval to export gas processed at a new liquefaction plant that the company is set to build at a facility off the coast of Texas. Elsewhere in the government’s press release, U.S. Undersecretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes explains, “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.” (Bolds are mine.)

Freedom gas. It appears that turn of phrase originated earlier this month, when Secretary of Energy Rick Perry signed an order aimed at doubling U.S. liquefied natural gas shipments to Europe. At a press briefing in Brussels, he explained that the move would help European nations diversify their energy supply away from Russia, the region’s major supplier of gas. “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent,” he said. “And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.” Afterward, a cheeky reporter from EURACTIV asked whether “freedom gas” would be a correct way to describe the new fuel shipments. “I think you may be correct in your observation,” an apparently inspired Perry responded.

And now it’s the Trump administration’s official line. As one of my colleagues put it, spreading freedom gas sounds like what happens when you’re newly single and suddenly have the apartment to yourself. Which raises the question: Did the Department of Energy mean to make a fart joke in an official statement? Or are we just lucky? The world may never know.","From now on this is known as a “freedom flame.” (It’s actually a natural gas flare in New Mexico.)

88,Bernie Sanders Is Not That Rich for Someone His Age,Jordan Weissmann,"Bernie Sanders, basic millionaire. Scott Eisen/Getty Images

Bernie Sanders has lived most his adult life in the middle class. But thanks to the book he published in 2017 after his first presidential run, he is now a millionaire. And because the Vermont senator has spent his career railing against the power of the rich, some writers have wondered if his newfound wealth somehow undercuts his political message. On Friday, Politico Magazine published a longish magazine piece, “The Secret of Bernie’s Millions,” that frames a deep dive into his history with money around that question:

There is no set strategy for how to run for president as a democratic socialist with an expensive lakefront summer house. Americans generally don’t begrudge millionaires their millions—and, as Donald Trump has confirmed, the aura of wealth can serve as a useful means of self-promotion—but what to make of Sanders’ apparently conflicting narratives? “He became the very thing he criticized others for becoming and at the same time didn’t fix any of the problems he’s been railing about that got him to this point,” Boston-based Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh told me.

There are many things that make this whole pseudo-controversy a bit silly. But one of them is that Sanders really isn’t that wealthy for somebody his age. He’s well-off, to be sure. But his level of affluence is pretty normal for a college-educated American in his 70s. The man earned a windfall, but he doesn’t suddenly have plutocrat money.

According to Politico, Sanders has a net worth “approaching at least $2 million, taking into account his publicly outlined assets and liabilities along with the real estate he owns outright.” To find out where that would put him in the U.S. wealth distribution, I asked People’s Policy Project founder Matt Bruenig to pull data from the Federal Reserve’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances. Assuming, for argument’s sake, that Sanders has exactly $2 million to his name, that would place him in the 93.9th percentile for net worth among all American households (a family’s net worth equals their assets minus their debts). To even qualify for the top 1 percent, he’d need more than $10 million.

Jordan Weissmann/Slate

An important thing to remember about wealth, though, is that older people tend to have more of it. Even if they have high incomes, younger workers are often stuck paying down student loans and mortgages, which lowers their net worth. Many older adults, on the other hand, have spent years piling up retirement assets and building home equity. Among Americans 65 and older, having $2 million would place Sanders in the 89.7th percentile for net worth. He’d need more than $12 million to qualify for the top 1 percent.

Jordan Weissmann/Slate

And what about college graduates? Among that slice of the country, Sanders’ wealth isn’t that remarkable at all. Among those 65 and older with at least a bachelor’s degree, $2 million is enough to hit the 75th percentile of net worth, according to the People’s Policy Project analysis. When you’re in your golden years, having a low-seven figure nest egg pretty much makes you part of the upper-middle-class.

Of course, the premise of the piece is a ridiculous one. Even if Sanders was suddenly a member of the wealthiest 1 percent, I don’t think it would really make him a hypocrite. The man wants to make America look a bit more like a Scandinavian social democracy, and last I checked, Swedes and Norwegians don’t have any problem with authors earning a payday. They just tax more of it. But the bottom line is that Sanders’ rhetoric about millionaires and billionaires has always been a shorthand for the power of extreme wealth, the kind that can buy you political influence. And he doesn’t have anywhere close to that kind of money.","But one of them is that Sanders really isn’t that wealthy for somebody his age.

89,"Amazon Is Shopping for Office Space in Manhattan, Proving HQ2 Haters Pretty Much Entirely Right",Jordan Weissmann,"Jeff Bezos, crying back. Jim Watson/Getty Images

Amazon is reportedly back in the market for office space in New York City, which, if true, is a sweet bit of vindication for critics of the company’s whole HQ2 fracas.

In February, Amazon dropped its plans to build a massive office complex in Queens amid political blowback over a package of state and city subsidies the project would have received. Now, according to the New York Post, the company is shopping for real estate on the West Side of Manhattan. “The tech giant has been in talks with owners of two shiny new skyscrapers located just one block west of Penn Station — the newly built One Manhattan West and its soon-to-be sister project, Two Manhattan West,” the paper reports, citing “sources.” The company, which already has 5,000 employees in the city, is apparently looking for 100,000 square feet or “much more.”

That footprint is significantly smaller than the 4 million to 8 million square feet of space Amazon planned to build out for its HQ2 project. But the fact that the company is still planning to grow its New York presence without a large, specially crafted subsidy package seems to prove the basic point many of the deal’s critics made, which is that major cities with large pools of business and engineering talent do not need to stoop to corporate welfare in order to attract major tech companies, which tend to go where they can find enough employees.

The sweeteners that New York offered Jeff Bezos to move to Queens—some of which, to be fair, would have been open to any company by law—may have encouraged him to plan a bigger immediate expansion in the New York area. But the “much more” in the Post report implies that Amazon may well add more space and workers in New York over time. Meanwhile, the real estate the the company was eyeing in Long Island City, which was already one of the fastest growing residential neighborhoods in the country, can still be used for another productive project like housing, and we don’t have to worry about the bad precedent of HQ2 encouraging other companies to sweat the state and city for tax breaks. Personally, I’m feeling pretty good about what I wrote last year:

Even if the incentive package [Cuomo] gave Amazon convinced it to pick New York over, say, Dallas, something else probably would have grown in the company’s absence. The counterfactual to consider isn’t Amazon or nothing. It’s probably Amazon or a bunch of new housing, or some other tech company and a smaller Amazon office.

The Post is framing its scoop as a giant black eye for left-wing politicians who opposed the HQ2 deal. “Amazon’s renewed focus on Manhattan so soon after dropping its plans for Queens is an apparent rebuke to the politicians who helped scuttle Amazon’s plans to build a 4 million-square-foot campus in LIC, including US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, sources said,” the paper writes. It is unclear who those sources are, or if they speak for the company, but the line isn’t especially convincing since, again, having Amazon lease open office space in Manhattan while leaving more room for rental development in Queens is a pretty happy ending for all involved. But if tech giants want to own New York’s libs by moving to the city without billions in subsidies, more power to them.","Jim Watson/Getty ImagesAmazon is reportedly back in the market for office space in New York City, which, if true, is a sweet bit of vindication for critics of the company’s whole HQ2 fracas.

95,"I, for One, Am Displeased About Having to Pay for Trump’s New $16 Billion Farmer Bailout",Jordan Weissmann,"Trump, surrounded by farmers, whom he is bailing out. Jim Watson/Getty Images

When Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he would provide $16 billion in aid to help farmers whose sales have suffered thanks to his trade war with China, he immediately assured Americans that they would not really be footing the bill. The bailout package, the president said, would be funded with money collected from his tariffs, which he insisted were being paid by the Chinese themselves. “It all comes from China,” he said. “We’ll be taking in over a period of time hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and charges to China. And our farmers will be greatly helped.” Minutes later, he repeated himself. “Just so you understand, these tariffs are paid for largely by China. A lot of people like to say by us,” he said.

Trump drops versions of this talking point constantly, and it is absolute nonsense. Some Chinese exporters may be losing business thanks to Trump’s levies, as their U.S. customers have started buying elsewhere. But the tariffs themselves are being paid by Americans. That’s true in the legal sense (importers are the ones who actually pay the tax when Chinese goods arrive on our shores) and the economic sense (so far, researchers have concluded that the full cost of the tariff really is being passed on to consumers and companies stateside; Chinese factories didn’t eat the cost by lowering their prices, at least last year).

So now, we find ourselves in a situation where families and companies are paying billions of dollars in extra taxes each year, part of which are being funneled to farmers who can no longer sell their soybeans, because Beijing decided to slap retaliatory tariffs on their crops. According to the White House, $14.5 billion of the bailout fund will be paid directly to farm owners; most of the rest will be used to buy some of the commodities piling up in lots so they can be sent to schools, food banks, and programs for the poor. This is all on top of a $12 billion package Trump announced last year. The grand total, $28 billion, is about what the U.S. spent last school year on Pell grants for college students. It’s not a small amount of money.

Politically, this makes obvious sense. Rural voters are a key constituency for Trump. And angry farmers could create enough political pressure to force him to back down in his conflict with Beijing. Your typical middle-class shopper, meanwhile, probably isn’t going to notice the price bump from tariffs on her Walmart receipt. By keeping soy and corn growers happy, Trump is making it possible to keep waging his trade fight. He’s deflecting the blow to people who won’t necessarily feel it.

If Trump manages to reach a deal with the Chinese soon, that might not be so awful. It will be some short-term pain for, hopefully, some long-term improvements in our trade relationship. But if it drags on, and the tariffs become semi-permanent, you and I are going to be stuck paying farmers to not sell anything. Everyone ought to be mad about the possibility.","The bailout package, the president said, would be funded with money collected from his tariffs, which he insisted were being paid by the Chinese themselves.

96,Washington Post Discovers That Elizabeth Warren Was Paid a Reasonable Fee for Providing Legal Services to Unobjectionable Clients,Jordan Weissmann,"Elizabeth Warren, who charged clients for her legal expertise. Alex Wong/Getty Images

Over the course of her career as a law professor, Elizabeth Warren was regularly hired to represent clients or consult on lawsuits. Most of the work involved bankruptcies, a subject on which she was considered a leading national expert. This sort of freelancing is basically standard in the legal academy, and even encouraged; after all, who wants to take courses from a pointy headed prof who never actually sets foot in court?

On Wednesday, Warren released a long rundown of her private legal work with a bit of uplifting framing: “Elizabeth was one of the nation’s top experts on how to make sure victims hurt by bankrupt companies eventually got paid. Throughout her career, she worked to help set up trusts and other mechanisms to return $27 billion to victims and their families.“

The Washington Post, which appears to have been digging around on this issue separately, responded with an article headlined: “While teaching, Elizabeth Warren worked on more than 50 legal matters, charging as much as $675 an hour.” The story leads off similarly, foregrounding the the $675 figure. The implication seems to be that Warren was cashing in or something, which is a bit odd. I mean, here’s where they got the figure:

In a separate review, The Washington Post found that a wave of Warren’s legal work came in the early 2000s as manufacturing companies whose products contained asbestos were forced into bankruptcy by waves of personal injury claims. A nationally recognized expert in bankruptcy law, Warren consulted for more than a dozen committees representing claimants and creditors in these cases, often in partnership with the law firm Caplin & Drysdale, for an hourly rate of $675.

In human speak, that translates to the following: A lot of people got cancer from asbestos products and sued the manufacturers, which declared bankruptcy. The victims’ lawyers then hired Warren as a consultant in cases where they ultimately set up compensation funds. That is … pretty unobjectionable, especially considering the kinds of legal work some of her Harvard colleagues took on. I mean, Alan Dershowitz helped his billionaire buddy Jeffrey Epstein secure a sweetheart plea deal after he was accused of preying on underage prostitutes.

And what about the fee? Some on Twitter—myself included at first—thought it actually seemed a bit low (we now live in a time where top attorneys can rake in $2,000 an hour). Was Warren being underpaid?

Frankly $675 an hour for Warren seems very very low. — Ben White (@morningmoneyben) May 23, 2019

Turns out she was not being lowballed. In 2002, The New York Times reported that billing rates for elite law partners in New York were approaching $700 an hour. According to a National Law Journal survey from 2001, hourly billing rates reached above $600 at just 14 law firms. The Justice Department determined that a “reasonable” fee for an attorney with at least a decade of experience in 2000 was $305 per hour (that’s according to the Laffey Matrix, which is used in cases where one party recovers legal costs from another). Consultants like Warren and expert witnesses sometimes earn a higher rate than lead partners on a case, but the bottom line seems to be that she was compensated like a top legal professional for the time.

It’s possible that some of Warren’s other legal work might raise questions—though it’s hard to tell from the Post’s review. She seems to have helped set up a victims’ compensation fund on behalf of Traveler’s Insurance that the company later wriggled out of having to distribute. (She told the Boston Globe that she hadn’t seen that coming.)There was also a case that pitted her against the future president of the AFL-CIO, though he later backed her Senate campaign.

But anyway, Warren appears to have made money by charging clients like asbestos victims an acceptable hourly rate practicing law. Scandal!","Elizabeth Warren, who charged clients for her legal expertise.

97,The Socialist Manifesto by Bhaskar Sunkara makes a pretty uninspiring case for trashing capitalism.,Jordan Weissmann,"Thousands of people attend a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in New York City’s historic Washington Square Park on April 13, 2016. Spencer Platt/Getty Images

The more Americans talk about socialism, the more the word becomes drained of any functional meaning. Some blame for that belongs to Republicans, who have spent decades hurling socialist as an epithet at anything to the left of a Kiwanis Club meeting. But some also lies with Bernie Sanders, who brought the term roaring back to life with his presidential campaign in 2016. The trouble was that while the senator called himself a “democratic socialist,” his platform mostly consisted of expanding the welfare state and more strictly regulating big banks. Those goals were completely compatible with, well, capitalism.

That’s why, despite being a mushy, center-left type myself, I was excited to read The Socialist Manifesto. The book’s author, Bhaskar Sunkara, is the founding editor of Jacobin, a quarterly political magazine that has become the house organ of America’s far-left boomlet over the past decade. And the book’s tagline promises “the case for radical politics in an era of extreme inequality.” Here, I figured, was a work that would plant a flag on the irksome question of what socialism actually is, and mount an argument for why we need it.

What I got instead was a book that mostly dwells on how socialist movements have failed throughout history, either falling short of their goals or descending into nightmarish authoritarianism. Even Sweden, famous for its generous welfare state, is treated as a cautionary tale. “The best we can say about socialism in the twentieth century is that it was a false start,” Sunkara writes. Out of this dismal track record, Sunkara tries to draw lessons about how today’s radical leftists can do better, but the result is not always inspiring. A more fitting title might have been The Socialist Manifesto: Let’s Try to Get It Right This Time.

First, the definition: From the get-go, Sunkara draws a bright line between social democracy—a capitalist economy where workers have strong legal rights and enjoy a robust welfare state, which is to say, Denmark—and democratic socialism, aka socialism, but with a democratically elected government. Social democracy sands off capitalism’s rough edges; democratic socialism feeds capitalism into the wood chipper, then builds something else in its place. Sunkara very much wants to make mulch from our current system of private enterprise.

A more fitting title might have been The Socialist Manifesto: Let’s Try to Get It Right This Time.

But how, exactly, would he do it? Sunkara imagines a world where individual companies are technically owned by the state but collectively controlled by their workers, who get to keep and split the profits, while all lending and startup funding are handled by a government development bank (goodbye, J.P. Morgan). His utopia is not a Soviet-style command economy; businesses would still compete freely with one another. But the labor and financial markets as we know them would no longer exist. (Sunkara handles much of this description in an oddly whimsical chapter involving a pasta sauce factory owned by Jon Bon Jovi’s family and a political movement started by Bruce Springsteen.* The term “pasta proletarian” is deployed.) There are, of course, other ideas floating around the internet about how socialism could work in practice. But the model Sunkara outlines hews to the decentralized ideals preached by Democratic Socialists of America, the small but influential political group that’s grown to about 60,000 members in the post-Sanders era (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez belonged).

I’m not sure that vision is what most Americans have in mind when they hear the word socialism these days, rather than, say, “Medicare for All” and free college, which fall comfortably under the definition of social democracy. But it would be useful if more pundits and politicians made as clear a distinction between the two concepts as Sunkara does. His definition also raises the question of whether Sanders himself is really a socialist in more than name, though Sunkara argues the Vermonter counts because he talks in terms of class conflict. “What separates social democracy from democratic socialism isn’t just whether one believes there’s a place for capitalist private property in a just society, but how one goes about fighting for reforms,” he writes. Later, he concludes: “Sanders gave American socialism a lifeline by returning it to its roots: class struggle and a class base.” Of course, other candidates, like Elizabeth Warren, have also campaigned as class warriors, even while paying homage to capitalism. The main difference seems to be that Sanders calls himself a socialist, which makes his rhetoric a bit of a gateway drug for the real thing.

But Sunkara isn’t really making the case for Bernie. He’s making the case for jettisoning capitalism. In doing so, though, he treats the history of the far-left as a long, sad slide deck about the ways good Marxist intentions are either not enough or can go horribly awry.

Some of that history is a bit dry, but it points to the practical reasons socialist movements have often failed to take flight. For instance, the left-wing activists are often more radical than the labor unions and workers they rely on for support, who tend to have more quotidian concerns than revolution. In the early 20th century, Germany’s Social Democratic Party had to moderate its politics and abandon plans for mass strikes in order to appease conservative trade unions. In the United States, the Industrial Workers of the World shot themselves in the work boot by refusing to sign any contracts with employers, which its leaders basically thought would be a sellout move to capitalism.* Most workers, quite understandably, decided they were better off with more moderate unions that would actually put their hard-fought wage agreements in writing.

Why should anybody be interested in socialism, given its often disastrous track record, when they could opt for social democracy instead?

Other chapters are more tragic. Sunkara explains how the Bolsheviks resorted to a murderous crackdown on their political opposition in the midst of a brutal civil war, and the way Stalin “used a food shortage to transform the Soviet Union from an authoritarian state into a horrific totalitarian regime unlike any the world has ever known.” He lays out how Mao’s “Great Leap Forward” resulted in famine and gets into the gory details of the Cultural Revolution, when infants were murdered for being “counterrevolutionary offspring.” Sunkara avoids the leftist cliché of downplaying China and the Soviets because they didn’t stick to socialism’s ideals, and instead tries to honestly reckon with their legacy. “The teleological streak in Marxism, its belief in laws of history—that through conscious political activity humanity could be pushed toward a new, more advanced stage of civllization—surely made Stalin and Mao feel justified in their cruelties,” he writes. “Any ideology built around a notion of destiny—nationalism and socialism alike—runs the risk of calamity.” (Coincidentally, this appears to have been the moral of the Game of Thrones finale.)

Though I’m pleased he didn’t sugarcoat things, this all leads to the question that hangs over much of Sunkara’s book: Why should anybody be interested in socialism, given its often disastrous track record, when they could opt for social democracy instead? Why do we need to eliminate Bank of America and hand Walmart over to its associates when we could just raise taxes, expand Medicare, and avoid, like, struggle sessions?

Sunkara tries out a few answers, to varying degrees of success. Wage labor is inherently exploitative, he insists, which is the sort of argument you either believe or don’t. Sunkara also speculates, kind of meekly, that a socialist government might be in a better position to fight climate change, and starrily suggests that international socialism might help bring about world peace. But in the end, a lot of his case seems to hinge on the idea that as long as capitalists are allowed to walk the earth in their Tod’s, they’ll eventually try to wage war on big government and the welfare state.

For most Americans, this capitalist threat might bring to mind the Koch brothers or Mercer family. But Sunkara points to Europe, where business leaders revolted in the ’70s and ’80s, as case studies. In Sweden, a powerful labor movement took advantage of the rapidly expanding postwar economy to build the most “livable” society in the world. But as growth slowed and inflation picked up, conservatives pushed back, curtailing some welfare programs and regulations, while crushing a plan that would have forced companies to share a portion of their profits. In France, business leaders pulled billions of dollars out of the country after a wave of nationalizations, effectively bullying the country’s socialist party into submission.

“Social democracy bolstered the power of labor to degrees few thought possible, but still left capital structurally dominant with the power to withhold investment,” Sunkara writes of Europe. “With the economy still reliant on their profits, capitalists were able to hold democratic governments hostage and roll back reforms.” In other words, better to wipe out the bankers and private equity guys entirely, lest they go Galt. (Sunkara isn’t wrong when he argues that capital tends to strike back. But while Sweden might not have achieved the socialist dream, for instance, it’s still a pretty nice place to live. Plus, many people believe the neoliberal reforms were good for the economy.)

What’s a bit frustrating and ultimately disappointing about the book is that while Sunkara can imagine the danger of leaving the Kochs around to fight Medicare for All, he doesn’t really grapple with the potential downsides of, say, putting business lending and venture capital entirely in the hands of the federal government. Just try to picture a world where all startup funding is controlled by a democratically elected government as corrupt or politically vindictive as the Donald Trump administration—it’s not pretty, and it’s an easy way to understand why it’s good to have thriving private enterprises around as a check on government power, the same as it’s good to have a strong government as a check on corporate power.

I’m sure Sunkara would respond that there would be safeguards in place to head off graft and make sure government moneymen made wise decisions. But as his book makes clear, history tends to make a mockery of our plans. The nice thing about a mixed economy is that when things don’t quite pan out as intended, you still have the private sector to fall back on.

In the end, these debates are still a bit academic (no matter how vicious they might get on Twitter). But the short-term goals of the true Jacobin left and the people who would just like to see the U.S. transition into a low-grade social democracy overlap in a lot of ways—a point that’s become all the more clear as Joe Biden, an actual moderate, has stepped out to an early lead in the Democratic primary, much to the left and far-left’s collective dismay. Those camps might disagree on whether we need Canadian-style single payer or a mixed health care system like Australia’s, but both want a lot more government involvement in health care. Both groups want to tax the living heck out of the nation’s billionaires. Sunkara might wish that the left would see the path to true socialism and fight to get there, but he hasn’t made a particularly good case for why anybody should.","The trouble was that while the senator called himself a “democratic socialist,” his platform mostly consisted of expanding the welfare state and more strictly regulating big banks.
“The best we can say about socialism in the twentieth century is that it was a false start,” Sunkara writes.
Social democracy sands off capitalism’s rough edges; democratic socialism feeds capitalism into the wood chipper, then builds something else in its place.
In the early 20th century, Germany’s Social Democratic Party had to moderate its politics and abandon plans for mass strikes in order to appease conservative trade unions.

98,Morehouse College debt forgiveness: a valuable natural experiment in economics.,Jordan Weissmann,"A video still of billionaire private equity mogul Robert Smith, captured after he promised to pay off the student debt of the 2019 graduating class of Morehouse. Reuters

When private equity billionaire Robert Smith announced this weekend that he would pay off the student loans belonging to the entire 2019 class of Morehouse College, at least two groups of people were especially excited. First, obviously, were the students and their families, for many of whom the gift is probably worth tens of thousands of dollars. (The median debt among Morehouse grads who borrow for school is $26,000, according to the Department of Education.) Second were the economics nerds, represented on Twitter by none other than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Every Morehouse Class of 2019 student is getting their student debt load paid off by their commencement speaker.



This could be the start of what’s known in Econ as a ‘natural experiment.’ Follow these students & compare their life choices w their peers over the next 10-15 years. https://t.co/UM1qTJOxHf — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 19, 2019

Natural experiments are pretty much what they sound like. In the hard sciences, researchers can usually test their hypotheses with traditional experiments. If you’re running trials on a new cholesterol drug, you randomly assign a test group and a control group. You give the latter a placebo, the former the new medicine drug, and see if health improves. Then you draw conclusions from the results.

Economists don’t often get to test their ideas in a lab, which can make it hard to distinguish correlation from causation—though Lord knows they try anyway with all sorts of fancy math and empirical strategies. But sometimes the real world provides events that can take the place of experiments. Some of the most famous research on how immigration affects wages, for instance, looked at what happened when a massive influx of Cuban migrants arrived in Miami in 1980 via the Mariel Boatlift. There was a great paper a while back that looked at the effects of prostitution on public health and policing after Rhode Island accidentally legalized sex work in 2003. The key is that these events are basically random, so it helps get around the correlation vs. causation problem. Cubans didn’t go to Miami because it had a great economy; it just happened to be close. Rhode Island’s dalliance with legal prostitution wasn’t a reflection of its enlightened ideas on STI prevention or policing.

You don’t get much more random than a billionaire arbitrarily deciding to pull an Oprah for a single class of college graduates. As a result, Smith’s largesse could help us learn about the effects of mass student debt forgiveness, a topic that’s gotten a boost of attention thanks to Elizabeth Warren’s plan to wipe out education debt. One strategy might be to study how this year’s batch of Morehouse alums fare in life compared with last year’s and next year’s, who could serve as control groups.

Coincidentally (at least, I assume it’s a coincidence), a group of economists released a draft study earlier this month that used another natural experiment to test the effects of student debt forgiveness. It looked at borrowers whose loans were canceled between 2010 and 2017 by a judge when it turned out the company that claimed to own their debts, National Collegiate, couldn’t prove it did. (The company had bought the debt from banks and other lenders, and the paperwork seemed to have been lost in the shuffle, which actually happens all the time with consumer debt.) The researchers compared those lucky beneficiaries of National Collegiate’s foul-up with similar borrowers who did not have their debts forgiven. Having debt forgiven seemed to make a large impact on people’s lives: They became more likely to move, and their incomes rose, on average, by $4,000. It seemed that removing the burden freed people up to pursue better opportunities for themselves. (Some recent research on credit card debt forgiveness has turned up similar results.)

Unfortunately, the results of the National Collegiate study might not tell us much about typical student loan borrowers. That’s because all the subjects who had their debt forgiven were previously in default, meaning they had run into financial trouble before the courts gave them a fresh start. It’s not clear that canceling the debts of somebody who was able to pay them back would have the same impact.

Looking at what happens to this year’s Morehouse students might give us a better sense of how forgiveness affects all sorts of borrowers, whether they’ve run into trouble with their loans or not. The only problem is that we may have to wait a while to see how these graduates’ lives turn out. As economist Justin Wolfers jokes, we can all look forward to getting some scientifically rigorous answers about loan relief about a decade from now. The paper’s title, of course, writes itself:","(The median debt among Morehouse grads who borrow for school is $26,000, according to the Department of Education.)

100,YouTube Keeps Having to Make Changes to Make Itself Safe for Kids,Ron Lyons Jr.,"Still cleaning itself up. Chris McGrath/Getty Images

On Monday, YouTube announced a handful of policy changes that affect how younger minors use the platform. Children under 13 will no longer be able to livestream on YouTube without an adult clearly present in order to “limit the risk of exploitation.” The Google-owned company, which already bans younger children from having their own accounts, will also limit how the platform recommends videos “featuring minors in risky situations,” a move that YouTube says will rely on “new artificial intelligence classifiers” to identify such content.

This comes on the heels of a shocking report in the New York Times that described how YouTube’s recommendation algorithm essentially curated strings of videos of barely clothed children, amplifying their reach and making them easily available to pedophiles. In one case, a 10-year-old girl in Brazil uploaded a video in which she is playing with her friend in bathing suits; once promoted by YouTube, the video was watched 400,000 times.

The safety of younger users has been an issue on YouTube—and social media in general—for years, but YouTube’s attempts to address this problem might be less familiar than the work done by Facebook and Twitter to deal with objectionable content. YouTube’s efforts illustrate just how difficult it is to insulate children from inappropriate behavior on the web, whether through software or through human moderation, and particularly at YouTube’s massive scale.

February 2015: YouTube introduces YouTube Kids, meant to be a safe version of the platform for young users. It has parental controls, educational content, and limitations on what can be uploaded and searched. In the years since, however, the service’s kid-friendly bubble has been punctured by conspiracy-themed content and worse.

November 2017: In what became known as the “Elsagate” controversy, seemingly kid-friendly videos on YouTube Kids turned out to include disturbing scenes. In one of the most notorious examples, Elsa from the movie Frozen is impregnated by Spider-Man. The controversy led to tighter rules about how videos featuring children’s characters could be uploaded and monetized, and the deletion of channels and videos that violated these rules.

February 2019: Amid a controversy in which pedophiles swarmed the comments sections of children’s videos, a number of major advertisers, including Coca-Cola, Amazon, and Disney, pulled their business from YouTube.

March 2019: YouTube disabled comments on many videos featuring children. While the company acknowledged that the move would disappoint some creators whose comment sections fostered productive discussions, “we also know that this is the right thing to do to protect the YouTube community.” a spokesperson for the platform told the Verge.

YouTube’s struggles with abusive, exploitative, bigoted, and otherwise inappropriate content extend far beyond content aimed at kids, as another incident from just this week demonstrates. On Wednesday, YouTube announced it would remove thousands of hateful and extreme videos while tweaking the platform so that it is “raising up authoritative content, reducing the spread of borderline content and rewarding trusted creators.” As part of these actions, YouTube said it would demonetize videos by a prominent right-wing creator who repeatedly insulted the sexual orientation and Cuban American heritage of Carlos Maza, a journalist at Vox. Once again, a platform used by 2 billion people is playing a familiar children’s game: whack-a-mole.","Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesOn Monday, YouTube announced a handful of policy changes that affect how younger minors use the platform.

101,Future Tense Newsletter: Winning the 5G Race,Anthony Nguyen,"A man plays a virtual reality game at a 5G store in Hangzhou, China. STR/Getty Images

Greetings, Future Tensers,

The promise of 5G conjures visions of smart cities, self-driving cars, and other futuristic luxuries. Before any of that can become a reality, 5G networks need spectrum for use, and it won’t be easy to find. Many bands on the spectrum are already in use, and we can’t make more of it. The American Meteorological Society, NASA, and other organizations and agencies are warning that the rollout of 5G networks on bands close to ones already in use might disrupt services we depend on, like storm tracking and weather forecasting. Jane C. Hu explains how full the electromagnetic spectrum is becoming.

In China, a slick, sci-fi-ish ad campaign boasts that 5G will help law enforcement use facial recognition to catch the bad guys. Kyle Mullin examines how the ad illustrates China’s relationship with privacy. April Glaser explains how Apple’s new secure login feature is a boon for some users and not all. And Lawrence Norden writes about why bipartisan efforts to shore up our election security are being stalled in Congress.

Other things we read between binging HBO’s Chernobyl:

Alexa: What happens when smart speakers develop personalities, like in the Miley Cyrus episode of Black Mirror? They already have some personality, but how much personality they should have is still up for debate, both in the new season of Black Mirror (premiering on Netflix today) and at the U.N.

Burial requirements: Jane Maienschein explains the problem behind laws requiring the burial or cremation of miscarried or aborted fetuses.

Doomsday: Would an electromagnetic pulse attack spell the end of civilization as we know it? Conservative pundits seem to think so.

Light speed: Elon Musk’s transportation system of the future is borrowing a lot of ideas from the past.

Off limits: Jane C. Hu delves into the use of YouTube videos and tweets by researchers and how it’s raising new ethical questions about data collection.

Tornado warning: Is climate change making extreme weather events even worse? Some evidence is suggesting just that.

To our old, curated iTunes playlists,

102,YouTube’s New Crackdown on Hate Speech Comes at a Curious Time,Chip Brownlee,"Nicolas Asfouri/Getty Images

On Tuesday, YouTube refused to remove videos from a right-wing YouTuber attacking a journalist for his sexual orientation and his ethnicity. It took days for the platform—owned by Google—to even respond to a complaint about the channel, and when it finally did, it said the content didn’t violate its harassment and hate speech policies.

Less than a day later, YouTube and Google announced the introduction of new policies aimed at “removing more hateful and supremacist content from YouTube.” In a blog post, YouTube said content that alleges a group is superior in order to justify discrimination on characteristics like age, race, caste, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status would be prohibited under its new hate speech policy. It’ll also remove some conspiracy theory videos that deny well-documented violent events, like the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting and the Holocaust.

YouTube’s announcement Wednesday comes as Silicon Valley tech giants continue to revise policies and rules aimed at tackling hate speech and misinformation on their platforms. Earlier this year, Facebook removed several inflammatory figures—including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, alt-right personality Milo Yiannopoulos, white supremacist Paul Nehlen, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan—for engaging in and promoting violence and hate.

But those moves have often been viewed as too slow or too narrow in scope. Extremist content often flies under the radar on the sites. Sometimes decisions also seem to split hairs: The Facebook page for Jones’ Infowars was taken down in August 2018, long before Facebook took broader steps to remove numerous other pages connected to Jones and Infowars. Meanwhile, conservatives—led by President Donald Trump—are criticizing the major tech companies for what they say is a crackdown on the right.

The problem often comes when the companies are forced to interpret and enforce their existing rules, as evidenced by YouTube’s decision Tuesday not to ban right-wing comedian and YouTuber Steven Crowder after Carlos Maza, a video producer and writer at Vox, said Crowder has harassed him online for years. Maza and others accused YouTube of giving a free pass to Crowder because of his channel’s popularity. (Update: YouTube tweeted Wednesday afternoon that it has “suspended this channel’s monetization. We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies.” In response, Maza tweeted, “Demonetizing doesn’t work. … The ad revenue isn’t the problem. It’s the platform.”)

Crowder’s derogatory insults—posted in numerous videos shared on YouTube to his more than 3.8 million subscribers—ranged from attacks on Maza’s sexual orientation to invectives about his ethnicity. YouTube tweeted Tuesday that the right-wing personality’s commentary wasn’t enough to violate the platform’s current anti-harassment and anti-bullying policies even though the policies prohibit content that “deliberately posted in order to humiliate someone” or “makes hurtful and negative personal comments/videos about another person.”

(2/4) Our teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don’t violate our policies. We’ve included more info below to explain this decision: — TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) June 4, 2019

It appeared that YouTube’s investigation began only after Maza posted a compilation of Crowder’s insults on his Twitter channel. That video shows Crowder referring to Maza as a “lispy queer,” an “anchor baby,” and the “gay Vox sprite.” In the Twitter post, Maza called for YouTube to take down Crowder’s offensive videos — in some of the clips Crowder can be seen wearing a “Socialism is for F—” T-shirt that used a homophobic slur.

Since I started working at Vox, Steven Crowder has been making video after video ""debunking"" Strikethrough. Every single video has included repeated, overt attacks on my sexual orientation and ethnicity. Here's a sample: pic.twitter.com/UReCcQ2Elj — Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019

“As an open platform, it’s crucial for us to allow everyone–from creators to journalists to late-night TV hosts–to express their opinions w/in the scope of our policies,” YouTube wrote on one of its Twitter accounts Tuesday night. “Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don’t violate our policies, they’ll remain on our site.”

So Crowder’s YouTube channel will stay up—at least for now. YouTube said in its Twitter post that it is investigating other claims against Crowder’s page, and it isn’t clear how Google and YouTube’s new hate policies will affect Crowder’s channel. The YouTuber has defended his posts as debate and comedy—not harassment.

YouTube’s announcement also said that it aims to reduce the circulation of borderline content by adjusting its recommendation algorithms to reduce traffic to content on the edge of violating its policies. Instead, it hopes to raise up authoritative voices like top news channels and reward “trusted creators” while improving enforcement of rules that remove advertising and monetization features from channels that brush up against its hate speech policies. Now comes the tough part: making the hard choices that will inevitably lead to criticism.","It took days for the platform—owned by Google—to even respond to a complaint about the channel, and when it finally did, it said the content didn’t violate its harassment and hate speech policies.

103,"Black Mirror’s episode “Rachel, Jack, & Ashley Too” looks at our relationships with smart speakers.",Rachel Withers,"Miley Cyrus and the Ashley Too Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Netflix.

When I was 8 years old, I had a rather vacuous talking doll. My Diva Starz Interactive Doll couldn’t respond directly to my voice, but she was semi-conversational, commenting enthusiastically when I changed her outfits, asking me yes/no questions, and offering girly platitudes that could have come straight from Malibu Stacy. Her name, funnily enough, was Alexa.

Ashley Too, the Miley Cyrus–voiced robo-doll in the third episode of Black Mirror’s fifth season (“Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too”), sits somewhere between my Alexa and Amazon’s Alexa—somewhere between toy and smart speaker, merchandise and friend. The smart device is sold in a fictional world dominated by a perky pop star named Ashley O (played by Cyrus), and has Ashley’s voice and personality programmed into it, allowing fans to feel closer to her. The episode follows Rachel, a lonely teenager who adores Ashley O and quickly comes to see Ashley Too as her real-life friend.

Ashley Too is more than a smart speaker—it’s also “your new best friend,” says Netflix—but it does a lot of the same things the Echo does. It plays music, answers questions, and even offers to read “motivational quotes from famous women” when you’re feeling down, not unlike one of the thousands of dubious-sounding Alexa skills. Ashley Too has eyes and a moving body, an idea one senior Amazon engineer recently floated for Alexa, too. The Black Mirror trailer left many wondering if Ashley Too was “an Alexa spin-off,” and not just because their names and aesthetics are so similar.

As Black Mirror is wont to do, “Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too” poses a lot of questions—about the future of music (holograms, streaming concerts, vocal mimicry) and the future of A.I. It calls to mind other episodes in which human personalities are downloaded into household objects, such as a smart home controller and a stuffed toy monkey. For me, these kinds of episodes raise another question: How much personality should a smart device have?

Without spoiling “Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too,” the smart speaker goes through a mid-episode personality change, transitioning from helpful and submissive to, well, a lot more like what I imagine the real Miley Cyrus to be like. In other words, from little personality to all the personality. Both options have their risks for smart speakers: Too much personality and we risk anthropomorphizing it, viewing what is essentially the mouthpiece of powerful tech company as a trusted friend; not enough and it’s a doormat, encouraging people to speak inappropriately to it and others.

The Ashley Too that comes out of the box is peppy and obliging (“I’ll be here for you!” “Here if you need to talk!” “Believe in yourself!”). She goes to sleep when told and wakes up when told. When spoken to rudely by Rachel’s cynical sister Jack, Ashley Too responds only with “I think you made a bad word choice.” When Rachel tells the doll to ignore her sister, she perkily complies: “I’ll make a note of that!”

Even with her initial “limited” personality, Ashley Too’s responsiveness leads the friendless Rachel to view the doll as a confidante—hanging out, doing a makeover, learning dances. When she screws up her performance in the school talent show, Rachel feels she has “let Ashley Too down,” leading her sister to point out “she’s not a person.” “She’s my friend,” Rachel replies. It’s not an unreasonable suggestion for Black Mirror to make: From kids to the elderly, many view their smart speakers as companions. In a Google Experience & Design survey, 41 percent of users said that talking to a smart speaker feels like talking to a friend or another person. Rachel is especially susceptible to falling into this trap, with research showing that loneliness makes people more like to form bonds with bots. The fact that Ashley Too has the voice of a celebrity, a real and recognizable individual, causes Rachel to feel like she is talking to some version of Ashley O—an effect that we may see in the real world as Google Assistant begins to offer voices from celebrities, like singer John Legend.

Smart speakers’ personalities are shaped by existing gender norms, and will continue to shape those norms moving forward.

I was never at risk of thinking my 2000s-era Alexa was my friend, because she wasn’t responsive to anything but magnets in her clothes and buttons on her feet, and her style of speech was far from natural. But as robots become more “human” in their interactions and tone, humans become more likely to bond with them, as Andreas Vogel and Nicholas Wright note in their recent Future Tense piece, raising all sorts of ethical questions around the dual role of trusted companion and persuasive sales associate. Once Ashley Too goes through its “change,” both sisters, even the cynical Jack, seem to accept it as a “person.” That “person” then convinces them to do something dangerous (the right thing to do, but still). Its colorful emotions and snarky sarcasm make its pleas and demands harder to ignore, even as they know intellectually that it’s a bot. How much more nuanced or individualized these “characters” will become remains to be seen—as Vogel and Wright note, smart speaker A.I. can also be “personalized” to each individual user.

The incident where Jack swears at Ashley Too reflects concerns contained within a recent United Nations report on the gendering of smart speakers. The report, “I’d Blush if I Could: Closing Gender Divides in Digital Skills Through Education,” expresses concern with the “deflecting, lackluster or apologetic responses” that feminized smart speakers give to verbal abuse, suggesting that their “unfailing politeness” could reinforce existing gender bias: “It honours commands and responds to queries regardless of their tone or hostility. In many communities, this reinforces commonly held gender biases that women are subservient and tolerant of poor treatment.” The report refers to a 2017 Quartz investigation, which found that the leading voice assistants responded to harassment either playfully or positively, with answers programmed by overwhelmingly male teams, suggesting this gender imbalance needs to change, and soon.

As the U.N. notes, smart speakers already carry “special emotive power,” simply by virtue of the fact that they sound like people. But what people don’t often realize is that the major smart speakers are already imbued with “personalities,” designed and tailored by the predominantly male teams who created them. The U.N. report pulls together commentary from the engineers on the ideas that went into designing them: Cortana is a “character … endowed with make-believe feelings, opinions, challenges, likes and dislikes, even sensitivities and hopes,” while Google Assistant was imagined as “a young woman from Colorado; the youngest daughter of a research librarian and physics professors who has a B.A. in history from Northwestern, an elite research university in the United States; and as a child, won US$100,000 on Jeopardy Kids Edition, a televised trivia Game.” In other words, they have been “intentionally humanized” and gendered in a way that carries meaning for their creators and users. Their personalities are shaped by existing gender norms, and will continue to shape those norms moving forward.

I sometimes refer to Alexa as “her,” as Rachel does with Ashley Too, much to Jack/the internet’s chagrin. But I’m cautious of where and how I use “it” and “she” for the character behind the Echo, wary of both under- and over-anthropomorphizing. Alexa is not a she, but there’s something highly uncomfortable about referring to something that has a specifically designated female personality as an “it.” There are risks to anthropomorphizing Alexa, but there are also risks to treating “her” like an object when “she” has an undeniably feminine personality and presents as a woman.

Both the U.N. report and “Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too” suggest that a lot more thought needs to be put into the characters being programmed into smart speakers, into how they behave and how “real” they feel. The level of personality digital assistants possess will certainly play a role in the unforeseeable ways they will influence human interaction, and it will be difficult to balance giving a digital assistant a voice and a spine without taking its character too far, especially now that they have been made “female” by default. One thing’s for sure: Smart speakers need a little more mettle when it comes to copping abuse. As Netflix U.K. and Ireland nicknamed Black Mirror’s latest futuristic product, “ashley too the hands free speaker that screams back at you.” Perhaps Alexa should too.

To use the internet is to constantly slam into locked doors. Want to watch a video? Please sign in. Care to comment? You’ll need to remember your password. Want to keep reading an article? Create an account. Many of us manage these password requests by using our login credentials from Google and Facebook to register with other websites. Clicking on “Sign in with Facebook” and “Sign in with Google” isn’t exactly frictionless, but it’s close.

That convenience came with a bargain: Users had to trust Google and Facebook to keep their personal details safe in exchange for the information those companies got to glean about all the websites and services we use. It was good for third-party apps too, which were able to dull their users’ annoyance at creating yet more new accounts by simply porting over their Google or Facebook info. Airbnb, Spotify, Tinder, Venmo—they all allow you to log in with Facebook or Google or both. The problem with this bargain is that when it comes to protecting user privacy, Facebook and Google haven’t always kept up their end of the deal—and they also use all that user information to power targeted-advertising businesses that more and more users find super creepy. Increasingly, those enticing buttons feel less like they’re worth the convenience.

If we see more of this trend, privacy will be more like a luxury for some rather than a right for all.

Enter Apple. At its annual developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled a new “Sign in with Apple” button for Apple device users to create new logins on websites and apps. It’s the same idea as those Google and Facebook buttons but from a company that’s known to be far more trustworthy with customer data—and that has been emphasizing its privacy bona fides as the other tech companies have come under scrutiny. But Apple isn’t just offering a third option. Users who opt to create new accounts with Apple can also choose to use a randomly generated email address that forwards messages to their actual inbox, preserving customer privacy even further by allowing users to keep their email addresses to themselves without sharing them with another company. It’s a smart innovation, and it’s no surprise that it comes from Apple—a company that went head to head with the FBI when it refused to help unlock the encrypted iPhone used by a shooter in the 2015 San Bernardino attack for fear that doing so would create a dangerous privacy precedent for the rest of its users.

If you’ve already paid the big bucks for an iPhone, you should definitely use Apple’s new privacy-enhancing login feature. And if you’re not an Apple customer, well, you can’t. That’s one rub that comes with all of Apple’s privacy enhancements: They do nothing for the majority of internet and smartphone users who don’t buy expensive Apple products. If we see more of this trend—in which the best privacy protections come as bonuses for high-end device owners—privacy will be more like a luxury for some rather than a right for all. That’s because digital privacy in the U.S. is barely regulated. There’s currently no broad federal policy that requires tech companies not to give our personal information to third parties without direct consent. As long as the terms of service we clicked through when signing up say that our data might end up elsewhere, tech companies are largely free to do as they please.

Take what’s happening to Facebook after mishandling the millions of users’ data that ended up in the hands of the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica, which improperly scraped the Facebook profiles of not only those who downloaded a personality quiz app but everyone they were friends with too. Facebook faces steep penalties now, but only because it allegedly didn’t follow a rule that was custom-made for Facebook after mishandling user data years earlier. When the company messes up in other ways, like by storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in plain text for years in a format viewable by thousands of employees, Facebook isn’t breaking a law. And when Google allows third-party apps for Gmail to read user emails in ways that aren’t clear to Gmail users, as the Wall Street Journal exposed last year, that’s fine too—again, as long as the small print in its user agreement says that might happen. There’s not even a rule that forces companies to share what they’ve shared about us. It’s hard to know how many third-party apps to which Google has granted permission to read its users’ emails. And once your data is out there, there’s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. It can be copied and shared over and over again.

Apple pulling in the reins on what apps can access about users is just the latest example of Apple regulating other companies. Earlier this year, Apple booted Facebook’s developer apps from its app store after Facebook wrongfully allowed non-employees to download a privacy-invasive app that wasn’t supposed to be available to the public. It also helps burnish Apple’s pro-consumer image at a time when the company is beginning to attract scrutiny for some of its practices—particularly whether aspects of its app store are anti-competitive.

And it’s not a win for all users. It’s a win for iPhone users and a win for Apple PR—though there’s no guarantee that Apple won’t change its policy in the future. So props to Apple for leading the industry here. But this is a business decision. It might cause some people to switch to an iPhone. It won’t protect those who don’t.

105,What Happens to Your Playlists Now That Apple Is Killing iTunes,Aaron Mak,"Apple’s Stacey Lysik speaks during the keynote address during the 2019 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

During Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi announced the end of iTunes, though not in so many words. He confirmed reports from late last week that set off a wave of eulogies for one of the 2000s’ most transformative platforms.

When users update their operating systems to MacOS Catalina, which will be released this fall, the stand-alone iTunes app will be no more. After jokingly announcing that iTunes would include a calendar function to acknowledge how bloated the platform has become, Federighi said, “The future … of iTunes is not one app, but three: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV.”

Users who have spent the better part of two decades curating iTunes playlists with songs not available on Spotify have little to fear. According to a company spokesperson, when you update to MacOS Catalina, your iTunes songs and playlists will automatically transfer to Apple Music, your podcasts to Apple Podcasts, and your videos to Apple TV.

Although iTunes will no longer exist as a centralized platform for storing different mediums of entertainment, it seems like its absence won’t be too noticeable in macOS Catalina. Leaked images of Apple Music that 9to5Mac published last week look almost identical to the current iTunes interface.","Apple’s Stacey Lysik speaks during the keynote address during the 2019 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).

106,The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,Richard L. Revesz,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Nivellen77/iStock / Getty Images Plus and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health.","The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection.

107,Should Researchers Be Allowed to Use YouTube Videos and Tweets?,Jane C. Hu,"Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photo by dimdimich/iStock/Getty Images Plus.

There’s a lot you might guess about a person based on their voice: their gender, their age, perhaps even their race. That’s your brain making an educated guess about the identity of a speaker based on what you’ve experienced, but sometimes, those guesses are wrong. (People I talk to on the phone who don’t know my name often assume I’m white because I speak English without an accent. They frequently express surprise to learn I’m Asian.) In a recent paper, a group of MIT researchers set out to investigate what a computer can guess about a person’s appearance from their voice.

To do that, the researchers trained their model using a dataset called AVSpeech, a selection of YouTube videos originally compiled by Google researchers for a different project. The model was fed face and voice data from hundreds of thousands of YouTube examples. Then, researchers fed the voices to the model and asked it to create a face it thought matched the voice. In the end, the model was decent at predicting what a person looked like but struggled with people of certain identities. For instance, while the model renders an Asian American man speaking Chinese as an Asian man, it draws up a white man when that same person is speaking English instead. It also appeared to have issues with voice pitch—it assumed people with high-pitched voices were women and those with low were men—and age. In short, it appears that the model learned some basic stereotypes about a person’s face and voice.

Unbeknownst to him, Nick Sullivan, head of cryptography at Cloudflare, contributed to this model’s “education.” He said a friend sent him the paper and was “quite surprised and confused” to see his face among the “successful” renderings. “I saw a photo of me, a computer construction of my face, and a computer-generated image that didn’t resemble me but had a similar nose and jaw dimensions,” says Sullivan. (In my opinion, he’s being quite generous about that computer-generated image; it’s unrecognizable as him.)

So this is weird. Apparently, I was used as an example in a paper in which an attempt was made to reconstruct images of speakers from audio alone. It didn't work out great. I'm including a current picture for reference. H/T @lotharrr for finding this. https://t.co/jsuXIlVfX0 pic.twitter.com/OIbB8dO3YI — Nick Sullivan (@grittygrease) May 26, 2019

Part of his confusion was that he hadn’t signed any waivers to be a part of a machine learning study, but he had signed waivers for appearance on YouTube videos, so he figured maybe one of those videos found its way into the dataset the researchers used. However, after some digging, he discovered the video used in the dataset and didn’t recall signing any kind of waiver for that one.

Most people don’t fully understand what “publicly available” really means.

Whether Sullivan signed a waiver likely doesn’t matter, though. Most research using data from human participants does require scientists to obtain informed consent (most often in the form of waivers). But YouTube videos are considered publicly available information and not classified as “human subjects research”—even if researchers are studying the intricacies of your face and voice. And while YouTube users own the copyright to their own videos, researchers using clips could make the argument that their work qualifies as “fair use” of copyrighted materials, since the end result is “transformative” of the original work. (In the case of the Speech2Face data, the model quite literally transforms your voice and face data into something else entirely.) Casey Fiesler, assistant professor of information science at the University of Colorado Boulder, says she’s never seen a copyright holder challenge researchers who used their internet posts as data. “There probably aren’t legal issues with it,” she says.

But just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical. That doesn’t mean it’s necessarily unethical, either, but it’s worth asking questions about how and why researchers use social media posts, and whether those uses could be harmful. I was once a researcher who had to obtain human-subjects approval from a university institutional review board, and I know it can be a painstaking application process with long wait times. Collecting data from individuals takes a long time, too. If you could just sub in YouTube videos in place of collecting your own data, that saves time, money, and effort. But that could be at the expense of the people whose data you’re scraping.

But, you might say, if people don’t want to be studied online, then they shouldn’t post anything. But most people don’t fully understand what “publicly available” really means or its ramifications. “You might know intellectually that technically anyone can see a tweet, but you still conceptualize your audience as being your 200 Twitter followers,” says Fiesler. In her research, she’s found that the majority of people she’s polled have no clue that researchers study public tweets.

Some may disagree that it’s researchers’ responsibility to work around social media users’ ignorance, but Fiesler and others are calling for their colleagues to be more mindful about any work that uses publicly available data. For instance, Ashley Patterson, an assistant professor of language and literacy at Penn State University, ultimately decided to use YouTube videos in her dissertation work on biracial individuals’ educational experiences. That’s a decision she arrived at after carefully considering her options each step of the way. “I had to set my own levels of ethical standards and hold myself to it, because I knew no one else would,” she says. One of Patterson’s first steps was to ask herself what YouTube videos would add to her work, and whether there were any other ways to collect her data. “It’s not a matter of whether it makes my life easier, or whether it’s ‘just data out there’ that would otherwise go to waste. The nature of my question and the response I was looking for made this an appropriate piece [of my work],” she says.

Researchers may also want to consider qualitative, hard-to-quantify contextual cues when weighing ethical decisions. What kind of data is being used? Fiesler points out that tweets about, say, a TV show are way less personal than ones about a sensitive medical condition. Anonymized written materials, like Facebook posts, could be less invasive than using someone’s face and voice from a YouTube video. And the potential consequences of the research project are worth considering, too. For instance, Fiesler and other critics have pointed out that researchers who used YouTube videos of people documenting their experience undergoing hormone replacement therapy to train an A.I. to identify trans people could be putting their unwitting participants in danger. It’s not obvious how the results of Speech2Face will be used, and when asked for comment, the paper’s researchers said they’d prefer to quote from their paper, which pointed to a helpful purpose: providing a “representative face” based on the speaker’s voice on a phone call. But one can also imagine dangerous applications, like doxing anonymous YouTubers.

One way to get ahead of this, perhaps, is to take steps to explicitly inform participants their data is being used. Fiesler says that when her team asked people how they’d feel after learning their tweets had been used for research, “not everyone was necessarily super upset, but most people were surprised.” They also seemed curious; 85 percent of participants said that if their tweet were included in research, they’d want to read the resulting paper. “In human-subjects research, the ethical standard is informed consent, but inform and consent can be pulled apart; you could potentially inform people without getting their consent,” Fiesler suggests.

Sullivan says it would have been nice to have been notified that his voice and face were in a research database, but he also acknowledges that given the size of the corpus, it would’ve been a difficult task. And in the case of Speech2Face, researchers were using a dataset originally collected for a different project. Even if the original researchers had notified participants that their videos were being used, would the Speech2Face users then also have a responsibility to renotify those users with details about their work? In any case, it seems like researchers could at least notify people whose personal details are published in a paper. “Since my image and voice were singled out as an example in the Speech2Face paper, rather than just used as a data point in a statistical study, it would have been polite to reach out to inform me or ask for my permission,” says Sullivan.

But even informing YouTubers might not be the best decision in all cases. Patterson, for instance, considered doing so but decided against it for two reasons. First, some of the YouTubers were under 18, which meant that reaching out to them would have required her to first contact their parents. Based on the videos’ candid content about their families and school experiences, Patterson said, it seemed like the YouTubers’ imagined audiences were definitely not parents. “It seemed like a violation of the way they envisioned this platform,” she says, but she also acknowledges that researchers’ eyes could similarly be seen as a violation. Additionally, Patterson said that the IRB officials she talked with said they had no precedent for contacting creators of publicly available content like YouTube videos and that ironing that all out would have taken months. In Patterson’s case, it just didn’t seem practical.

In the end, there’s no one-size-fits-all for researchers to determine whether using publicly available data is appropriate, but there is certainly more room for more discussion. “It would be nice to see more reflection from researchers about why this is OK,” says Fiesler, suggesting researchers’ published papers could discuss the ethical considerations they made. (The Speech2Face paper did include an “ethics” section, but it did not include this type of discussion, and when asked for comment, they pointed me back to this section.) Patterson agrees: “I think there are going to be more conversations for sure, and in the not too distant future, you might not even be able to do this kind of work.”

Ahead of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week, Bloomberg is reporting that the company will announce the end of its signature iTunes media platform. Apple will replace iTunes with three separate apps: Music, TV, and Podcasts.

Debuting in 2001, iTunes had its heyday in the 2000s as a virtual jukebox in which people could store their 99-cent MP3 purchases from the online Music Store. Apple originally marketed the platform as a tool for burning custom mixes onto CDs, and then as a playlist organizer for the then newly released iPod. The platform eventually expanded to include podcasts and TV shows in 2005 and movies in 2006, and eventually hosted the Genius algorithm that could build playlists based on users’ tastes.

With the advent of streaming, tech analysts have been predicting the end of iTunes for at least three years. Apple’s iPhones and iPads have forgone iTunes for stand-alone video, music, and podcast apps for quite some time now. The Apple Music streaming service has been the default for devices for a while. It’s only Mac computers that still use the iTunes platform. As Rolling Stone suggests, phasing out iTunes fits in with Apple’s overall strategy to become an entertainment services provider. Sales for its marquee iPhone lines have begun to lose steam in recent years, so Apple has been exploring new markets with TV, payment, newspaper, and gaming products. Users have also long had complaints about iTunes’ clunky integration and syncing features.

109,Tornado Season This Year Has Been Devastating. Can We Blame Climate Change?,Chris D'Angelo,"People look on as they examine the damaged remains of a school in Dayton, Ohio, on Tuesday, after powerful tornadoes ripped through the state overnight. Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images

This story was originally published by HuffPost and has been republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

As the seemingly endless barrage of violent tornadoes continued to pummel a large swath of the United States this week, lawmakers and concerned citizens declared on social media that the storms offered a front-row seat to the unfolding climate crisis.

During a presidential campaign stop in disaster-stricken Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren posted a video in which she says planetary warming is helping drive severe weather events, including tornadoes, and blasts those who deny the reality of climate change for “putting us all at risk.” In a post to Twitter, Sen. Bernie Sanders, another 2020 contender, slammed the Trump administration for working to undermine climate science as sections of the central United States reel from tornadoes and catastrophic flooding. And when D.C. was put under a tornado warning on May 23, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted to Instagram: “The climate crisis is real y’all.”

The scientific community has long warned that anthropogenic climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones, heat waves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. But the influence of human activity on tornadoes remains less clear.

That’s in part due to a limited amount of historical data. Unlike temperature and hurricane records, which date back more than a century, reliable tornado records go back only a few decades. Twisters are also short-lived, making it difficult to study individual events and detect trends.

Yet, even with these shortfalls, there is evidence that our changing climate may be leaving a mark, causing clusters of tornadoes and a shift in range.

“While there is some debate within the scientific community about the details of how climate change will impact tornadoes, there is increasing evidence that a warming atmosphere―with more moisture and turbulent energy―favors increasingly large outbreaks of tornadoes, like the outbreak we’ve witnessed over the past few days,” Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said by email.

“There is increasing evidence that a warming atmosphere―with more moisture and turbulent energy―favors increasingly large outbreaks of tornadoes.” — Michael Mann

In other words, planet-warming greenhouse gases could be helping to drive the storms that ultimately set the stage for tornado development.

The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated federal report released late last year, concluded that tornadoes have “become more variable” and are among the extreme weather events that are “exhibiting changes that may be related to climate change, but scientific understanding is not yet detailed enough to confidently project the direction and magnitude of future change.” The report also notes that “there is some indication that, in a warmer world, the number of days with conditions conducive to severe thunderstorm activity is likely to increase.”

This month’s spate of tornadoes―the most active tornado period since 2011, according to the Weather Channel―has been fueled by a long-stalled jet stream air current, which forced a pool of cool air over the Southwest to collide with moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. As of Thursday, the preliminary tornado count for May stood at 442, with the vast majority touching down over the past two weeks. Texas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma were among the states hardest hit, although tornadoes also popped up outside the region typically known as Tornado Alley, in places like New Mexico, northern Minnesota, and Maryland.

James Elsner, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University, called the two-week run of tornadoes “unusual.” Whereas a typical outbreak might last two or three days, this one just kept spawning twisters. Elsner’s research has shown that, though the annual number of tornadoes has remained steady, the number of tornadoes per outbreak has spiked. Tornado records show that the odds of having 32 tornadoes in a single day doubled from 1950–2013, he found.

“We’re not saying climate change is directly causing these outbreaks,” Elsner said. “But I think there is a fingerprint of climate change on what’s happening.”

A more recent study, published in 2016, also documents a shift in concentration. It found that “the frequency of tornado outbreaks (clusters of tornadoes) and the number of extremely powerful tornado events have been increasing over nearly the past half-century” but that it is unclear if this trend is caused by climate change.

Perhaps the most significant change in tornado activity is where they strike. In a paper published in the journal Nature last year, Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University, showed that Tornado Alley is slowly creeping east, with fewer twisters in the Great Plains and an increasing number in the more densely populated Midwest and Southeast.

“It’s not a big jump to say that climate change is causing this shift east,” Gensini told CBS News at the time. “The hypothesis and computer simulations support what we are observing and what we expect in the future.”

In a series of posts to Twitter this week, Gensini reminded the public that climate change doesn’t cause tornadoes or any other extreme weather event but is one of many variables that can contribute to their occurrence. He compared it to hitting a home run in baseball while on steroids.

“Was that home run due to steroids? Maybe, maybe not.” he wrote. “Hard (impossible?) to tell only examining an at-bat. Much easier to tell when examining seasonal home runs and batting averages.”

Approximately 1,200 tornadoes touch down in the U.S. each year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This year is already well ahead of pace, with just over 1,000 tornado reports as of Wednesday. The violent storms over the past two weeks left a trail of splintered homes and other damage across multiple states.

110,Dead Fetuses Are Not “Remains”,Jane Maienschein,"Anti-abortion demonstrators outside Whole Woman’s Health of McAllen, Texas, on Feb. 27, 2016. Ilana Panich-Linsman for the Washington Post

In 2016, the Indiana Legislature passed HB 1337, which then-Gov. Mike Pence signed into law. Among other things, HB 1337 said that “a miscarried or aborted fetus must be interred or cremated,” with several specifications to make sure that that would actually happen and could be verified. The law specifies that the miscarried or aborted fetus does not have to be given a name by the mother, the process can be kept anonymous, and more than one fetus can be cremated at a time.

The bill made its way through appeals courts before reaching the Supreme Court, which on May 28 rejected a number of its passages. Yet the Supreme Court upheld the part about disposal of fetal remains. That part of the legislation remains in force, and it has far-reaching consequences.

If the material is understood as remains, then it must be remains of something. For proponents of such laws, that something was previously a person. For many others, it was not. Fetal remains bills therefore strike at the heart of personhood discussions. The Supreme Court’s allowance of the Indiana fetal burial or cremation law in effect supports the highly problematic assumption that fetuses must be treated as persons. As many commentators have noted, this decision involves a serious attack on abortion rights in ways that seek to impose the political and moral views of some people on everybody. Much of the response, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s opinion, has focused on other parts of the Indiana law. Yet requirements about disposal of fetuses pose undue emotional and practical burdens on women. Women who have just suffered a miscarriage or gone through an abortion must make additional decisions about what happens to the dead fetus, even when they consider it just a dead fetus and not deserving of any special treatment. And medical facilities will be required to find ways to carry out expensive burials and cremations as well as places to accept the material, and then presumably pass all those costs on to patients.

If the material is understood as remains, then it must be remains of something.

Indiana is not the first or only state to use protection of fetal remains to place restrictions on women experiencing miscarriages or choosing to have abortions. A similar law in Texas received a permanent injunction from U.S. District Judge David A. Ezra in 2018. That law reached further than Indiana’s by including “embryos” as well as “fetuses.” (Embryos are the earliest stages of development, typically up to eight weeks, at which point the developing organism is called a fetus.) It was also worded to apply to any medical facility. Therefore, as Ezra noted, the Texas law would require that if a pregnant woman went to a dentist and then had a miscarriage in the dental office, the dentist would be responsible for handling the remains. He clearly thought that was unworkable.

I served as an expert witness in the case, which lasted for a week. Some witnesses were patients who explained that such a law would make them feel that they were being forced to regard the embryo or fetus as a person. They did not believe that the tissue at early developmental stages was a person, and they did not want to be forced to treat it as such. One woman discussed her experiences at a medical clinic where she had gone for emergency treatment when her pregnancy was failing. She was treated for a miscarriage, and the facility required a burial or cremation for what they called her “baby.” She said that she would never have gone to that hospital if she had known what would happen.

Other witnesses said that they did not think of the dead embryo or fetus as “remains” of anything. Its being buried or cremated for later burial gave the dead tissue a status they did not feel it deserved. Some medical providers reported on their experiences with patients with diverse views. My role as a historian and philosopher of developmental biology was to establish that society has had a long-standing divergence of opinion about how we value developing humans. For at least a significant percentage of the population, embryos are bunches of unformed cells, and fetuses exhibit gradually emerging form and function over time. For many, the fetus becomes a person when it is born. For others, the ill-defined point of viability might also count. And for some, personhood begins at “conception.” Yet we know that a single fertilized egg can produce an embryo that splits into two (or more) through twinning. We also know that two separately fertilized embryos (following two different “conceptions”) can merge together into one chimera. The simplistic idea that life and personhood begin with conception is problematic in numerous ways.

In the Texas case, witnesses in favor of the law spoke to the need to respect life and provide “dignity,” along with other standard arguments. But the judge pointed to the burden placed by the law on women seeking to exercise their right to abortion. For practical, financial, and emotional reasons, he determined that the law violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. It also violated the equal protection clause because it treated some facilities, namely in vitro fertilization clinics, differently from other health care facilities. In his summation, he concluded:

the clear weight of the evidence shows that the waste disposal options required by the challenged laws would cause many, if not most, doctors and healthcare facilities providing pregnancy-related care to women to be overwhelmed with embryonic and fetal tissue remains with no acceptable method of disposal. Indeed, those few state officials tasked with attempting to insure implementation of the challenged laws were relegated to asking private cemeteries, funeral homes, and crematoriums for help. With the exception of a non-contractually binding offer from the Catholic Church in Texas that it would do what it could, little else was forthcoming. … [M]any issues … make this offer, although well intended, problematic and presently unworkable in light of the numerous unresolved logistical problems.

That Texas trial and ruling made clear that at least a large number of women, and perhaps a majority, regard dead embryonic or fetal material as medical waste. They expect it to be treated as such. Yet the Indiana law demanded that fetal material not be treated as “infectious or pathological waste,” and the Texas law stated it must be disposed of as “human remains” and “may not be placed in a landfill.”

Women’s reproductive rights and constraints are increasingly moving under the control of state governments, with the resulting patchwork of conflicting decisions and underlying values. The dead fetuses that some consider medical waste, others consider human remains. While women with access to information and resources are likely to find ways to make the decisions they find appropriate about abortions, they will still face obstacles in states like Indiana, where they are forced to treat dead fetuses in ways they may not agree with.

111,This Ad Shows Just How Much Chinese Consumers Trust Facial Recognition Technology,Kyle Mullin,"Still from a China Mobile ad promoting 5G. Screengrab from Twitter

In a scene reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster’s trailer, a Chinese policeman dons a pair of futuristic facial recognition–equipped sunglasses. He scans each member of the crowd at Shanghai’s People’s Square subway station. Before long, he pinpoints a crook—whose disguise may have fooled humans, but not technology—and starts chasing him down.

This is from my WeChat feed… pic.twitter.com/0ddePmONFO — OJ (@audiocomedian) May 27, 2019

The video is an advertisement for state-owned telecom giant China Mobile’s new 5G network. The voiceover in Mandarin at the end of the clip doesn’t endorse facial recognition outright, but it does boast that 5G is speedy enough to make “smart cities possible.”

People around the world are grappling with facial recognition. Earlier this month, it was officially banned in San Francisco. Congress recently held a hearing about the pitfalls of the technology. Meanwhile, a backlash broke out in the U.K. last week after a Welsh man complained that the authorities breached his privacy with facial recognition, prompting police to defend what they call a valuable crime-prevention tool.

All that pales in comparison with China’s usage of the technology. Critics have accused the Chinese government of using such technology in its suppression of the Uighur minority, with experts digging up copious amounts of evidence to back up those claims. There are also concerns that facial recognition will be abused nationwide. Cameras equipped with the technology have sprung up alongside most major Chinese city streets, and even in some public bathrooms.

Alarming as such widespread state surveillance might seem to many Westerners, much of the Chinese population has welcomed its increasing ubiquity. As author Jianan Qian wrote in a New York Times op-ed, “Many people in China seem to be happy about the physical security promised by the surveillance network. Our mind-set, long ago, was wired to see safety and freedom as an either-or choice.”

That sentiment is echoed by Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. He told me, “People care most about efficiency and order in China. They are not really concerned with so-called privacy.”

Privacy is certainly not paramount for the policeman in the China Mobile ad, who scans countless faces before zeroing in on his suspect and chasing him through the crowded Shanghai subway. One Chinese viewer of the ad, Fan Popo, said he couldn’t help but be “impressed with how well this video is made.” Anyone familiar with his work might be shocked to hear him praise such an advertisement. After all, he’s a filmmaker known for speaking truth to power. In 2015, he brought a successful legal case against China’s state media regulator when his LGBT-themed documentary Mama Rainbow was censored. And while he liked the quality of the ad, he was troubled by the themes behind it, saying, “It’s well-made propaganda, promoting how facial recognition is supposedly helping to improve society, and if you don’t accept it you will have bad people running away without being caught.”

According to Wu, the ad’s “highlighting of how facial recognition can catch criminals is little more than justification. Justice isn’t the intention of such surveillance—it’s a byproduct of top-down control.”

However, average citizens might not feel such pressure from on high when they think of facial recognition, which has become part of consumer life too. Cosmopolitan Chinese increasingly turn to face scans for chic conveniences, including paying for the subway and KFC. That trust may be misplaced: A recent survey found the “pay with your face” function on Alipay, a widely used Chinese app, to only be 70 percent accurate, well below the 90 percent accuracy pledge that Alipay made five years ago. But Wu says that such issues haven’t phased many Chinese users, in part because the technology’s potential for convenience and efficiency is high

Matthew Brennan, co-host of the China Tech Talk podcast, is hesitant to make blanket statements—pointing out that plenty of cosmopolitan Chinese share values and viewpoints with Westerners—but he does suspect that facial recognition is widely accepted in China for deeply cultural reasons. He calls China a “low-trust society, while Western societies tend to be high-trust.” Brennan chalks that difference up to rampant scams, from street corners to social media feeds, that have long plagued the People’s Republic of China with uncertainty.

“People care most about efficiency and order in China. They are not really concerned with so-called privacy.” — Alfred Wu

Oddly enough, that lack of trust typically doesn’t apply to government higher-ups or the cutting-edge tech firms linked to those officials. Instead, those upper echelons are often seen as sources of strong leadership or innovation that can root out lower-level, local corruption, including scammers and unscrupulous neighbors. A recent Bloomberg article unravels that paradox by describing an app piloted in one Chinese city, through which users can report what they deem to be dubious behavior of fellow citizens to the authorities. It goes on to say, “Depicted outside of China as a creepy digital panopticon, this network of so-called social-credit systems is seen within China as a means to generate something the country sorely lacks: trust. For that, perpetual surveillance and the loss of privacy are a small price to pay.”

“In business, Westerners tend to trust people until they prove themselves untrustworthy, but the opposite is true in China,” Brennan said. “It stems back to the deep tradition of guanxi, or relationships, where friends introduce you to people you can trust for tasks or transactions.” He thinks most domestic viewers of the China Mobile supercop ad would “see it putting forth strength to hunt down bad actors. Meanwhile in Western society, we’d say the state has too much control, and facial recognition is being used for negative purposes. It boils down to perceptions of trust.”

Despite that thoughtful take, Brennan was right to be hesitant about making blanket statements. There was no shortage of nuanced comments made by Chinese viewers of the China Mobile ad on microblogging website Weibo. For instance, one commenter wondered, “What if a bad guy uses this facial recognition technology to cheat you?” Another wrote, “5G is ushering in a scary, naked period, where personal rights mean nothing compared to the rights of the broader public.”

Cynical as all that sounds, another netizen was even bleaker, writing, “This technology is creating a cage for us that is invisible to the naked eye.”

112,How Trump Could Be Prosecuted After the White House,Renato Mariotti,"Renato Mariotti is the Legal Affairs Columnist for POLITICO Magazine. He is a former federal prosecutor and host of the “On Topic” podcast.

With Congress enmeshed in a fraught debate over whether to impeach President Donald Trump, Robert Mueller’s brief and dramatic news conference provided a sharp reminder that impeachment is not the only option for addressing the president’s alleged misdeeds.

The outlines of a potential civilian prosecution of a former president Trump are already emerging. While there are reports of tax dodges, illegal campaign contributions, and improper foreign contributions to his inaugural committee—among other things—investigations into those claims are ongoing. There is, however, an overwhelming case that the president engaged in obstruction of justice—his effort to stop the special counsel’s office from probing his campaign’s ties to Russia.

Story Continued Below

In the second volume of his 448-page report, Mueller sets forth evidence of obstruction of justice that any competent federal prosecutor could use to draft an indictment. And Mueller made it clear himself that his detailed report was intended, in part, to “preserve the evidence” because “a President does not have immunity after he leaves office.”

Although it’s impossible to know exactly what a prosecution of Citizen Trump would look like, or who would conduct it, it’s already possible to project some paths a likely prosecution would take. In the eyes of a seasoned former federal prosecutor looking only at the evidence we have so far, here are the likely routes—and what Trump has to worry about next.

The Three Strongest Cases

Mueller’s team examined 10 distinct courses of conduct by Trump that could constitute obstruction of justice, but it’s not clear there is sufficient evidence to prove them all beyond a reasonable doubt. Three of the potential charges, however, are so strong that they are virtually certain to be included in any indictment of Trump. (They’re strong enough that over 1,000 former federal prosecutors signed a letter stating that Trump would be indicted if he were not president.)

The strongest count would be his attempt to fire Mueller, the man appointed to investigate the Russian government’s interference in the 2016 election and the possibility that the Trump campaign conspired with it. Very simply, obstruction of justice is when someone acts to undermine an investigation with the intent to do so, and there can be no serious question that firing Mueller would have curtailed the investigation. By the time Trump tried to fire Mueller, he knew the special counsel was also investigating him for obstructing justice. Trump tweeted about how he was under investigation a day before he tried to fire Mueller, and White House counsel Don McGahn warned Trump about his “exposure” for obstructing justice.

On June 17, 2017, Trump directed McGahn to get Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to remove Mueller, telling him “you gotta do this.” When McGahn didn’t follow through, Trump called him a second time the next day, after which McGahn decided to resign. Ultimately, he didn’t quit, but didn’t follow through on Trump’s order, either.

Weeks earlier, McGahn advised Trump to avoid “trying to meddle in the investigation” and that “knocking out Mueller” would be “another fact used to claim obstruction of justice.” When your lawyer tells you that doing something could be a crime and you do it anyway, that is extremely strong evidence of your criminal intent—“substantial” evidence, in Mueller’s own words.

That episode would be the strongest count in an indictment of Trump, but at least two others would almost certainly also be charged. The first came two days later, on June 19, 2017, when Trump summoned former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (then a cable news commentator) to the Oval Office. In a private meeting, Trump dictated a private message and asked Lewandowski to personally deliver it to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe. That is notable because McGahn previously made clear to Trump that he could not contact the DOJ or FBI about the investigation. Going to a private citizen allowed Trump to bypass McGahn’s directive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/1707/1155968404_6042351574001_6042350053001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

During the meeting, Trump directed Lewandowski to tell Sessions that he should give a speech stating, among other things, that he would meet with Mueller and limit his investigation to “investigating election meddling for future elections” as opposed to the 2016 presidential election. A month later, Trump followed up with Lewandowski and asked whether he had spoken to Sessions. Lewandowski told Trump the message would be delivered soon, and Trump told him that if Sessions did not meet with him, Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Lewandowski gave the message to an aide who knew Sessions better than Lewandowski did. But that aide never passed along the message because it made him “uncomfortable.” The aide lied and told Lewandowski he delivered the message, which he subsequently disposed of.

There is plenty of evidence that Trump knew his conduct was wrongful, from his attempt to bypass McGahn by going to a cable news commentator, to the prior advice McGahn already gave Trump about efforts to curtail the investigation.

The third count that would almost certainly be included in any indictment of Trump was his effort to pressure McGahn to create a false record to hide the fact that Trump had directed him to fire Mueller. Trump’s attorney initially made a request to McGahn’s attorney to deny a New York Times article reporting that Trump ordered him to fire Mueller. When McGahn refused to recant the story, Trump became angry. He told one aide that McGahn was a “lying bastard” and said that if McGahn didn’t write a letter denying the Times’ account, Trump would fire him.

Later, after McGahn refused to comply with Trump’s request, Trump called him to discuss the matter. Trump told McGahn he did not say what McGahn remembered him saying—he hadn’t used the word “fire,” he said. Trump asked why McGahn had told Mueller’s team about his directive to McGahn. McGahn told Trump he had to—their conversations were not protected by attorney-client privilege—and moreover, that he had notes of the conversation. (Trump told McGahn that he “never had a lawyer who took notes.” McGahn memorably retorted that a “real lawyer” does.)

Although asking someone to write a letter is typically not a crime, in this case, McGahn was an important witness against Trump. If McGahn wrote a letter that lied about what Trump did and said, it would completely undercut his value as a witness against Trump.

The evidence supporting these three counts tells a tightly knit story of Trump’s efforts to fire and curtail Mueller and Trump’s attempt to hide the fact that he had done so.

The Second-Tier Charges

Some prosecutors would limit an obstruction indictment to these, but others might include Trump’s efforts to dissuade Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, from cooperating, which Mueller appears to believe is supported by substantial evidence.

One reason it’s weaker is that unlike the three previous charges, Trump would have a viable defense against a charge that he tried to push Manafort not to cooperate: It is based almost entirely upon comments that Trump made publicly. While it is true that public statements can obstruct justice, Trump is the president of the United States, and was commenting on matters of intense public interest. While that does not excuse Trump’s comments blasting the idea of cooperation with law enforcement, Trump might argue that his motive was to improve his political standing, not to obstruct the investigation. It’s not a great defense, but it is viable.

A strong argument could also be made to include Trump’s direction to former FBI Director James Comey to “let [former national security adviser Michael] Flynn go” and potentially his subsequent decision to fire Comey. While Mueller does not think the evidence supporting this conduct is as strong as the evidence supporting the potential charges discussed above, it demonstrates a pattern of behavior—Trump tried to control the scope of the investigation of him and his associates and was willing to fire those who oversaw the investigation because they posed a danger to him.

Trump’s main defense to that charge would be a legal claim that the president cannot obstruct justice by exercising his power as president. This argument, which was made most notably by William Barr when he was a private citizen, would also be used by Trump’s legal team as a defense to his orders to fire Mueller and curtail the investigation against him. Mueller examined this legal view and persuasively dismissed it, as most legal scholars have, but no court has ruled on the issue because no president has ever been indicted for conduct while in office. (It’s worth noting that Barr recently admitted that he disagreed with Mueller’s legal analysis, and his own outside-the-box view informed his “exoneration” of Trump.)

Other Legal Jeopardy

Things could get even worse for Trump between now and January 2021.

Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York told a federal judge that Trump directed payments (to women he had had affairs with) that were campaign finance crimes for which Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty. This does not necessarily mean that there is sufficient evidence to charge Trump—the statement by prosecutors operated under a lower standard of proof, and they would need to prove Trump’s intent and knowledge—but it nonetheless represents a significant danger for Trump, given that their investigation is ongoing. There are numerous other ongoing federal and state investigations of Trump and his associates, from a probe of his inaugural committee’s finances to an investigation of the Trump Organization.

State-level charges have an extra level of jeopardy because Trump cannot be pardoned for them by a president. It’s entirely possible for a recently defeated Trump to step aside and allow another president—potentially Vice President Mike Pence—to pardon him before a federal case could even be brought. (That would not be unprecedented. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon about a month after he became president.)

There is also the danger that Trump could engage in additional obstructive conduct before the next election, particularly if the House of Representatives initiates an impeachment inquiry. This might give Trump an incentive to pressure or influence potential witnesses against him, like McGahn. Most clients in legal jeopardy know not to make matters worse for themselves, but Trump has demonstrated that he does not always follow the advice of his attorneys.

So, for Trump, much more is riding on the next election than remaining in office. The five-year federal statute of limitations applies to obstruction of justice, and obstructing a federal investigation is not a state crime, which means that a reelected President Trump could not be prosecuted for his obstruction in 2017 until he left office in January 2025, which is over two years after the statute of limitations would run. Some have argued that the statute of limitations would be tolled (essentially, put on hold) while Trump was in office, but no court has reached that conclusion and it’s unclear one ever will. For that reason, winning the election might be Trump’s best path to avoid being charged with a felony.

113,The Pointless Argument Tearing Conservatives Apart,Rich Lowry,"David Goldman/AP Photo opinion The Pointless Argument Tearing Conservatives Apart

Rich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.





The most bracing pieces are sometimes the most indefensible.

So it is with Sohrab Ahmari’s fusillade in the religious journal First Things against my National Review colleague David French that has occasioned a cataract of conservative commentary.

Story Continued Below

Let’s skip over over the misrepresentations of French, which even most supporters of Ahmari regret. What’s most interesting is the deeper divide between French, an unapologetic defender of the American liberal order, and Ahmari, whose piece is part of the “post-liberal” ferment among a coterie mostly of Catholic writers on the right.

Ahmari, a Catholic convert who has written a widely praised memoir, From Fire, By Water (and is a friend), argues that conservatives should give up on defending a neutral public square and instead “impose our order and our orthodoxy.”

This would seem a fierce rallying cry in the culture war, but really — like the denunciations of the American political order from a smattering of Catholic writers — comes from a place of despair that, if acted on, would promise only more futility.

The animating insight of the “post liberal” writers and their allies seems to be: We are losing the culture war so badly that the only option left is to impose our values on everyone else. How will they do that? Good question! We’ll get back to you after we are done savaging our allies.

To simplify, Ahmari’s prescription is fighting harder, being less civil, caring less about individual liberty, and focusing energy on politics instead of culture toward the end of socially conservative government impositions. He also expresses suspicion of evangelicals (French is one) for being naturally inclined to oppose authority, for instance, national churches.

This hardly sounds like a winning formula. Ahmari says he was shocked into his more radical posture in the culture war by the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation fight.

Imagine, though, if conservatives had made the case for Kavanaugh on the basis that decency doesn’t matter to us much anymore — so we don’t care about the truth of the allegations against him — and furthermore, that we expect him to impose his Christian (or more specifically, Catholic) values on the country. We would have lost the confirmation fight in a rout and would have deserved to.

Kavanaugh won the day by appealing to reason, fair play and the presumption of innocence — in other words, those things that the most disillusioned Catholic conservatives perhaps consider a sucker’s game, yet still have considerable purchase with the American public.

Needless to say, America is not a country ripe for the imposition of Catholic traditionalism. First, there’s no precedent for it. We are not talking about France or Spain here.

Second, conservative Catholics aren’t operating from a position of strength. Overall, about 20 percent of the U.S. population is Catholic. Of those, only 37 percent of Catholics are Republican or lean Republican; 48 percent believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 57 percent strongly favor or favor same-sex marriage.

All this would seem to counsel coalition-building, one of the projects of the great former editor of First Things, Richard John Neuhaus.

Ahmari appears to envision politics, and government action, as an escape from culture and excoriates French for the heavy emphasis he puts on cultural transformation. But politics isn’t a magic wand. In a liberal democracy, it depends on public sentiment, which is decisively shaped by culture.

If this country had more faithful believers, its culture would be in a better place and so would its politics. This is what makes it so strange that Ahmari pours scorn on the idea that we need religious conversions. “Calls for religious revival,” he writes, “are often little more than an idle wish that all men become moral, so that we might dispense with moral regulation.”

Who, one wonders, is going to do this moral regulating? Unless it is self-appointed guardians of virtue, it has to be people who win political office through democratic elections. And it helps immensely in that cause to have more socially conservative, religious Americans rather than less.

Indeed, if evangelicals were just a slightly smaller portion of the population, Donald Trump would have lost in 2016, something Ahmari—like me, a Trump skeptic who’s warmed to the president—should welcome.

Overall, the growth of evangelicals has been a crucial cultural and political backstop for social conservatives. While Catholics and mainline Protestants have been losing numbers at an alarming clip, evangelicals have been gaining them.

One of their priorities that Trump has honored has been appointing constitutionalist judges. This is right and proper.

Besides its value in and of itself, as a practical matter, the Constitution is the strongest protection that believers have.

Let’s assume everyone on the right agreed that the American founders were too liberal and somehow stripped the First Amendment out of the Constitution. Would this free religious conservatives to steamroll and suppress our opponents, or the other way around? Almost certainly, the latter.

All that said, there’s much I agree with Ahmari about.

There’s obviously cause for great alarm in the culture war, which has unquestionably entered a new, more treacherous phase.

We need to push the GOP to become more socially conservative and less libertarian, and recognize there will be no return to the party circa 2004.

We need to realize that America suffers, not just from a swollen state, but from a toxic individualism, people detached from family, church and community, and thus from larger meaning.

Finally, we need to hang together and if we can’t muster decency when fighting our adversaries, at least show some when disagreeing with allies.

114,The One Thing Trump Gets Right About Tariffs,Jennifer M. Harris,"Jennifer M. Harris and Todd N. Tucker are fellows at the Roosevelt Institute. Follow them @jennifermharris and @toddntucker.

President Donald Trump’s threat to levy tariffs on Mexico has triggered a political war in Washington, and not the usual partisan kind. Some Republicans are girding to fight their own president, rightly finding it absurd that he would take out his frustrations over immigration by increasing the cost of trade. As Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) told POLITICO, the White House ""is trying to use tariffs to solve every problem but HIV and climate change."" Trump supporters like Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), meanwhile, don’t see many options. “[W]hat alternative do my GOP colleagues have,” he tweeted, “to get Mexico to secure its southern border… & act on intel we provide on human traffickers?”

Much as it pains their colleagues—and as hard as it is for Washington to process this—Trump and his backers have a real point. Not about his immigration policies, which are part of a harmful cultural war and stand a real chance of inflicting long-term damage on the American economy. But the administration’s use of tariffs to push its foreign policy goals is not as irrational as Trump’s enemies make it seem. It shouldn’t be this way, but in 2019, if the United States wants to fix some of the big policy arguments it has with its trading partners, it has left little leverage besides the blunt tool of tariffs.

Story Continued Below

For that, the blame lies with Democratic and Republican administrations alike, including Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, who collectively have let U.S. economic policy shrink in ambition—a battle fought on a narrower and narrower field, leaving us with so few weapons that tariffs have become the most useful last resort.

A nation as powerful as the United States would traditionally be expected to have a fully developed economic and industrial policy, one that integrates incentives and priorities on the domestic front with carrots and sticks for foreign partners. In that universe, Mexico’s own immigration enforcement might be part of a much wider package of goals negotiated between the two nations, one that creates strong incentives for Mexico to comply, without hurting American consumers and companies the way tariffs would.

This fuller agenda, which some experts call economic statecraft, has been the norm for much of the country’s history. But unlike America's competitors, the United States has largely shelved this kind of economic thinking. President Obama, for instance, pitched the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement as a way to ensure that America, rather than China, would write the rules of the global economy. But under the hood, it was never a very compelling economic argument for the United States: The rules that China negotiates in its own trade deals overlapped considerably with the American proposal, meaning that the TPP was more a matter of diplomatic gamesmanship than a real plan to advance workers here at home

To politicians like Obama, raised in the heyday of global free-market consensus, government industrial policy is a thing of the past, and trade relationships are really just a matter of opening as many markets as possible—regardless of whether the benefits actually outweigh the losses for a given country. The evidence now strongly suggests that consensus has been wrong. To take just one problem, the magnitude of corporate tax evasion made possible by modern trade agreements should make all of us question whether the traditional lifting-all-boats assumptions of trade efficiency still hold up.

With Trump's election, it's now acceptable to at least name the problems the U.S. has confronted on the world stage, ranging from coercive Chinese requirements over our manufacturers to corporations invoking their global supply-chain decisions as a reason we can’t fundamentally rethink U.S. trading rules. But Trump’s solutions to those problems suffer just as much from an absence of creative ambition. For instance, the administration pitched steel tariffs as a way to rebuild manufacturing communities. Months later, steelworkers showed the hollowness of this strategy when they went on a massive strike, complaining that tariffs had raised steel company profitability without any of that money trickling down to workers. The solution to their problems wasn't just an industry-friendly trade policy; they needed good collective bargaining agreements as part of the deal.

The threat from China makes these issues even more urgent. With the launch of its ""Made in China 2025"" industrial strategy for which China pledges to attain dominance in key industrial sectors, the U.S. faces a major competitor that does not feel bound by postwar liberal market norms. In a relatively high-tariff environment, such as the global economy of the mid-20th century, the U.S. could dangle market access as a carrot in order to entice other countries to get on board with U.S. foreign policy goals. In the low-tariff America of 2019, there’s little leverage to be had.

So there is a certain logic to Trump’s jacking up of trade duties in order to fashion new bargains. The problem is, the Trumpists also struggle to develop new ideas on how to do it, starting with a slim menu of tariffs and tax cuts. In February, Rubio put out an 80-page report that dutifully catalogues China’s illiberal plans for industrial supremacy, and rightly notes that “The critical policy consideration, then, is not whether states should organize their economies, but how they should be organized.” Rubio deserves credit for breaking with Washington orthodoxy. But the proposed response falls short: defensive measures like tariffs, along with revenue-depleting tax cuts and traditional small-business programs. With a state diminished by those cuts, who will pay for the reorganization of the economy?

This disconnect is not surprising. For the past few decades, policymakers have embraced neoliberalism, a broadly open-market political philosophy whose effects have been to redirect more power toward the economically powerful and marginalize the economic majority. Things may be changing. Leading academics, public intellectuals on both the right and the left, and even the International Monetary Fund are calling for a return to a robust domestic industrial policy. On Tuesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren released the latest missive in this debate. Warren’s Plan for Economic Patriotism suggests we can learn from how other countries have made globalization work for their populations, offering a fuller range of tools. These include requirements for companies that benefit from federal research and development dollars to invest their proceeds back at home, across the country as a whole (not just in coastal cities).

Former Vice President Joe Biden has promised to tackle Chinese competition, while Senator Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) has pointed to a long record of opposition to trade deals. In academia, a new generation of scholars is applying the latest econometric tools to understand how and when industrial policy is likely to deliver broadly shared gains.

All of this ferment marks a welcome pivot in America’s long turn away from more comprehensive economic approaches. It is time to acknowledge that the threadbare 58 manufacturing programs across 11 federal agencies that the U.S. has at present are unlikely to cut it. A more coordinated push would privilege middle-class wage growth over the profit margins of pharmaceutical and technology companies, cultivate green industries of the future and slow or even reverse the financialization of the economy, which has been America's de facto industrial policy of the past 30 years.

Critics love to dismiss such coordinated approaches as command-and-control socialism, but in fact these ideas are deeply American, harkening back to an earlier economic planning tradition in American politics that extended from Alexander Hamilton to Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon.

Instead of helping steel or cars in isolation, the way Trump's tariffs ham-handedly do, policymakers could look at them as part of a whole system that needs rules to ensure industry and manpower delivers for the country as a whole. This is a break from progressive trade rhetoric of the past, which often puts its faith on international rule-making bodies like the TPP or World Trade Organization. If only China could be made to follow the rules, the story went, then all would work out well for the U.S. worker.

There is no such complacency in the new thinking on industrial policy. In truth, it is the responsibility of each nation to develop its economic strategy and rules. While this need not be zero sum, it also doesn't magically sort itself out.

In short, tariffs may be a part of the package to solve America’s economic woes, but not necessarily, and not necessarily the most effective. There is no substitute for rebuilding the social contract that knits together workers, corporations and their government—creating a stronger platform for the United States to face the challenges of an increasingly competitive global economic environment.","But the administration’s use of tariffs to push its foreign policy goals is not as irrational as Trump’s enemies make it seem.

116,Trump’s American Emperor Moment,Jack Shafer,"Mark Wilson/Getty Images Fourth Estate Trump’s American Emperor Moment The cloaking of the U.S.S. John S. McCain made official what Trump has been signaling for his whole term.

Jack Shafer is Politico’s senior media writer.

It matters little whether orders to hide the U.S.S. John S. McCain from President Donald Trump’s sight during his U.S. Navy base visit came directly from Trump or, as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would have it, they were issued by a “23- or 24-year-old person” on the White House advance team looking to shield the touchy president from any reference to McCain, his political nemesis. Either way, Trump has gotten the U.S. military to pay him the deference a king expects.

Trump has steadily erased the boundaries that separate the military from politics. Last Thanksgiving, during a holiday phone call with troops, he browbeat the unfortunate servicepeople on the other end of the line with his views on migrants, trade and judges. In a December visit to troops in Iraq and Germany, he broke the standard rules prohibiting the politicizing of the military by giving overtly political speeches. In May, the Daily Caller reported his plans to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to perform police work on the border. Pentagon press briefings, once at least a weekly occurrence, haven’t been held for more than a year. Why? Senior officials tell CNN’s Barbara Starr that “televised briefings stopped because of worries that TV watcher-in-chief, President Trump, would get angry if he saw something he didn’t like.”

Story Continued Below

Many voters and pundits sleep easier at night by telling themselves this is just Trump being Trump, an outsider who doesn’t restrain his ego within the usual lines. But these are an authoritarian’s moves. They aren’t restricted to the soldiers and sailors under his direct command. He has also feted America’s other armed responders, like sheriffs and police chiefs, with pandering speeches that invite cops to crack heads if they feel like it. In a July 2017 speech at Suffolk County Community College before a backdrop of uniformed police officers standing in formation, Trump claimed that “the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years they’ve been made to protect the criminal.”

Who is that “us”? Trump was never a cop, but his use of the plural pronoun is deliberate—he encourages the police to identify with him, directly and personally, and not with the chain of command or the laws that are supposed to govern their behavior. Addressing a group of sheriffs last September, he portrayed the police as disrespected and defamed—the way he views himself—saying, “We will not tolerate smears, or slanders, or assaults on those who wear the badge and police our streets.” Speaking over the chain of command to soldiers and police, El Jefe style, he fashions himself the final authority on the use of force. In an April visit to the Mexican border, he personally directed members of the U.S. Border Patrol to block migrants from entering the country and to ignore any judge who might contradict him, and he lamented the fact the military can’t get rougher on the border.

The stop-worrying-so-much crowd isn’t wrong that Trump is play-acting—populist style—for his political base, and that he has no intention to go full- or even partial-authoritarian on the nation by suddenly summoning his most loyal troops and police to his cause. But the precedent matters, and he’s increasing the chances of a more competent, future executive who might build on Trump’s personal cultivation of the military and police to behave more like an emperor than a president.

So far, Trump hasn’t co-opted the military as much as he’s cowed it. Since becoming president, he’s routinely injected politics into his speeches and appearances at military bases. “We had a wonderful election, didn’t we?” he said at MacDill Air Force Base in February 2017. “And I saw those numbers, and you liked me and I liked you.” In the early months of his presidency, he tinseled the higher levels of his administration with military brass—H.R. McMaster, John Kelly, James Mattis and Michael Flynn—calling them “my generals,” as if they were his possessions. The hiring spree failed, though, because Trump wanted only the style, not the discipline of the military way.

Even so, the only direct resistance the military has paid Trump has been passive: Earlier this year, senior uniformed and civilian Defense Department personnel sat on their hands when he criticized Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the “radical left” in a campaign-style harangue. Not until the U.S.S. McCain incident did the military finally protest Trump’s politicization attempt, but then only in a weak-kneed, bureaucratic fashion as acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan directed his chief of staff to tell the White House to cool it. The only consistent criticism from the military establishment of Trump political shenanigans has come from retired military personnel.

Not every department of lethal force has bowed to the president. The FBI and the intelligence community, more often targets of Trump’s bile than of his fawning and flattery, stand out as exceptions. But he still strives to make the G-men and spooks his captives. He recently gave Attorney General William Barr unprecedented powers to declassify intelligence connected to the Russia probe that critics might end up politicizing intelligence and law enforcement. And just this week, he finalized plans to turn Independence Day on the National Mall, long an apolitical expression of love of country, into his own “A Salute to America” celebration.

Trump isn’t the first president to attempt to bend the military and police to him. John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert to the office of attorney general to get better control over federal law enforcement. Richard M. Nixon founded an entirely new law enforcement branch, the Drug Enforcement Administration, from which he extracted extraordinary loyalty. But no president has injected politics into official agencies of force as Trump has.

In so doing, Trump has already sketched out how an American emperor would behave. Earlier this year in an interview, Trump warned “the left” it could expect extralegal violence from his best-armed supporters if it steps out of line. “I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump—I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough—until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad,” he said.

Soldiers, cops and bikers getting tough on “the left” in the name of their president. Chew on that image for a moment.

117,Can Trump Still Sue His Way Out of Trouble?,Michael Kruse,"Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.

To keep hidden the details of his long-clandestine finances, Donald Trump has been waging a legal war wildly unusual for a commander in chief. He and his allies and associated business entities have sued two big banks he did business with plus Trump’s own accounting firm as well as the Democratic chairman of the congressional oversight committee. So far, federal judges have rejected these lawsuits, and Trump’s attorneys have appealed to keep the cases going.

These tactics, testing the limits of the separation of powers that underpin the government of this country, have been called “outlandish” in Congress. To those, though, who have followed Trump’s career, they’re nothing if not predictable. For nearly half a century, Trump, 72, has used lawsuits as cudgels and prods and publicity stunts. He and his wingmen have used them, or threats of them, to harass, to deflect and delay, to punish opponents and protect his brand, his money, his image, himself. Even in the face of losses, he has used them to find a way to wins.

The difference now is that Trump’s legal arsenal includes not just an array of personal attorneys but the vast resources of the Department of Justice—which at times he has hoped would serve the same role as his most bare-knuckled advocates. He is fighting personal legal battles that have ramifications today and potentially well into the future for the nation’s most important public office. Apples-to-apples numbers on this front are hard to come by, according to experts on the presidency and the judiciary, but scholars are confident in stating that Trump (with the possible exception of Richard Nixon) is unique in this regard. “I know of no president who was so openly combative and willing to sue and be sued,” said presidential historian Robert Dallek, who is working on a book called How Did We Get Here: From TR to Donald Trump.

The people who have known him the longest are not surprised in the least. “He sues,” said Barbara Res, the Trump Tower construction manager and a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization. “That’s his M.O. He sues.”

“It’s just another tool in his war chest,” said Jack O’Donnell, the former president of the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. “He uses it to wear people out, whether it’s financially or emotionally.”

“He’s used litigation historically to keep hostile forces at bay and to delay reckonings,” Trump biographer Tim O’Brien said. “He’s also used it to try to embarrass competitors, critics or opponents. And I think by and large he’s done that successfully. He’s the poster child for the abuses and inefficiencies of the American court system.”

But can it work in this new venue? “That,” O’Brien said, “is the question that’s being tested right now: Is Donald Trump, as president, above the law?”



***

He’s not above the law. He’s just using it like any other citizen can, and should. That’s the view, at least, of Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor emeritus and frequent Trump defender. And it might even serve a useful political function.

“Bringing lawsuits is a way of invoking the system of checks and balances,” Dershowitz said, “and presidents historically have brought lawsuits, have responded to lawsuits—it’s a way of bringing the judiciary into the system of checks and balances that are tripartite in nature.” He called “reasonable” litigation “a perfectly appropriate use of the system of checks and balances.”

If nothing else, Trump has had an abundance of practice. His exhaustive history of weaponizing the courts started in 1973, when DOJ sued Trump and his father for racist rental policies in their fiefdom of outer-borough apartment buildings. Trump responded by hiring Roy Cohn, the notorious judicial and political fixer who’s been called “pure evil,” “a legal executioner,” and “one of the most despicable people in American history.” Cohn and Trump sued the feds right back—for $100 million. “The countersuit was bullshit,” said Elyse Goldweber, one of the prosecutors involved. But it extended the timetable of the case and turned it into a public relations skirmish as much as a matter to be settled purely in court. Nearly two years later, Trump and his father signed a consent decree pledging to change their ways, “one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated,” as DOJ put it. Trump, unchastened, insisted it was a win—a precursor to one of his most telltale maneuvers. Furthermore, for the government, the aftermath was galling. With Cohn at the point, the Trumps for years dragged their feet, exasperating subsequent prosecutors and effectively defanging the enforcement of the decree. As a whole, it would prove to be a singular font of so much of what was to come.

“Trump claims he went to Wharton business school,” presidential historian Doug Brinkley said. “What he did was attend Roy Cohn University.”

“Everything Trump does is steeped in Roy Cohn’s mentoring and teaching,” Cohn cousin David Lloyd Marcus said. “Roy knew that you could threaten to litigate, and that often that was enough. But also Roy knew that you could tie up things in the courts for years. Years. This is all right from the Roy playbook.”

A voracious pupil of the ruthless attorney, Trump has sued or been sued at least 4,000 times, according to the yeoman’s work of reporters from USA Today. He has sued people over unpaid royalties in licensing deals. He has sued Miss Pennsylvania. He has sued Bill Maher. He has sued the creator of Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. He has sued Scotland. He has sued New Jersey. He has sued New York City, and he has sued New York state. He has sued Palm Beach. He has sued an architecture critic from Chicago. He has sued the secretary of the Interior and the National Indian Gaming Commission. He has sued people for using his surname in businesses … even though it was also their surname. He has sued and been sued by his first ex-wife. He has sued and been sued by Steve Wynn. He has sued and been sued by longtime business partners. “Just another lawsuit filed by Trump as a diversionary tactic,” a spokesman for one of those partners once said, “attempting to intimidate and to substitute publicity for substance.” He has threatened to file countless lawsuits he then hasn’t filed.

And legal documents show that when he has to give sworn answers, he is a grudging, hair-splitting deponent, performing his own versions of Bill Clinton-esque parsing. “Well, the word ‘developing,’” he once said in a deposition, “it doesn’t mean that we’re the developers.”

“I know lots about litigation,” Trump said in a speech at a get-together of the Nevada Republican Party in Las Vegas in 2011.

“Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?” he asked at a campaign rally in January 2016. “I’m like a Ph.D. in litigation.”

“It’s a business for me,” he told Megyn Kelly that May, calling it a “tactic,” “and I have been successful—and I’ve, you know, used litigation, and sometimes I use it maybe when I shouldn’t, and sometimes I don’t.”

Last month’s lawsuit was not, for instance, the first time he sued Deutsche Bank. Back in 2008, he filed a suit against his most noted lender, attempting to wiggle his way out of $40 million of a construction loan he had personally guaranteed, worried he was staring at a catastrophe at the onset of the recession, taking the extraordinary legal position that the national real estate bust was an unforeseeable act of God, same as a tsunami or hurricane, that should void his obligations. It was, said one of the attorneys for the bank, “kind of crazy” and “kind of telling.”

“Every morning he wakes up and says, ‘Who can I sue?’” late public relations maestro John Scanlon once said.

“Anytime he thought someone was going to sue him,” Res said last week, “he would find a way to sue them first, because he wanted to be the plaintiff. He had this notion that if you were the plaintiff, you had a better chance of winning.”

There are, however, plenty of losses on Trump’s legal ledger.

He lost to the NFL. He lost to Marvin Roffman. He lost to Vera Coking of Atlantic City. And he lost to O’Brien, the biographer, whom he sued for reporting that Trump wasn’t worth what he said he was worth.

“He lost,” O’Brien stated bluntly. “Because the weight of everything was on our side. He routinely says publicly that he cost me a lot of money. He knows that’s not true. I didn’t pay a dime for any of that litigation. The New York Times’ lawyers were free to me, and my book publishers paid for outside counsel. And he knows he didn’t win that case. And he knows the results of choosing to litigate were far, far more damaging for him than for me.”

But O’Brien cautioned onlookers at this stage about reading too much into how that went down.

“That’s the exception, actually, in the long history of his litigation,” he said. “Most of the time he’s gotten the results he’s wanted.”



***

What was it that he wanted? To intimidate. To pay less. To save face by distancing himself from faltering projects. To fuel publicity. To buy time. To win in the longer run. For now, the Trump administration’s “win rate” in the federal courts is abysmal. The two recent suits he filed to block subpoenas for his records were summarily shot down, both judges ruling with unusual speed and dismissiveness. In these cases, if Trump was trying to delay, if he was trying to intimidate, it didn’t work. “It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a president for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct,” one of the judges wrote, adding that Trump’s legal arguments had “fundamental” problems. At this, though, Dershowitz shrugged. “What’s important,” he said, “is what the courts ultimately decide, not how many lower courts go against him.”

“Contemporary presidents end up in court a lot, mostly regarding their interpretation of regulatory statutes,” said Texas A&M professor George C. Edwards III, editor of Presidential Studies Quarterly. “Trump is unusual in his blanket resistance to accommodating congressional investigations, which leads to numerous lawsuits.”

“This is another case where President Trump’s behavior is norm-busting,” added Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.

Trump has never had to grapple with this high a degree of scrutiny and interference. He also and equally notably has never had more power, and one of the primary ways in which he’s already a president of great consequence is that he has markedly altered the ideological makeup of the federal judiciary—up to and including, of course, the Supreme Court. And this is what people who know him the best think about when they think about Trump in his role as litigator in chief.

“I think he expects that the judges he appoints will help him one day,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer and a CNN analyst.

“I think he believes that every suit he’s involved in will go to the Supreme Court and he will win,” Res said.

“Because he’s got the deck stacked,” O’Donnell said.

“I think,” O’Brien said, “unless institutions, particularly the law enforcement community and Congress, stand up for the rule of law, Trump is going to do an end run around people.”

“I think all he wants to do is get to November 2020,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond and an expert on the federal judiciary, “and he’ll be able to drag it out in the courts if he wants to.”

And it all traces back to the beginning. “He is using what he knows how to do best,” said veteran New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf, who’s been watching Trump for decades, “his knowledge of how to use the legal process and lawyers to stop his opponents from injuring him. And it’s worked. So why shouldn’t it work here?”

","“He sues,” said Barbara Res, the Trump Tower construction manager and a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization.
“He uses it to wear people out, whether it’s financially or emotionally.”“He’s used litigation historically to keep hostile forces at bay and to delay reckonings,” Trump biographer Tim O’Brien said.

118,Progressives Should Read Progressive History—So They Don’t Blow It This Time,Joshua Zeitz,"""Medicare for All."" ""The Green New Deal."" Calls to overhaul the Supreme Court and replace the Electoral College. Many activists today are heralding a new progressive movement—a successor to the vibrant reform coalition that swept both major political parties in the early years of the 20th century.

There’s more than a little truth to this comparison. America’s current reality—marked by rising income inequality, the concentration of political and economic power and changing patterns of work and leisure—bears uncanny similarity to conditions that produced a burst of reform activity more than 120 years ago, including measures to improve urban health and safety standards, ameliorate labor conditions and introduce more efficiency and transparency in state and local government.

But if contemporary progressives aspire to drive the same degree of change as the progressive movement of the early 20th century, they might take a cue from their ideological forebears.

Many of today’s progressives define their movement by commitment to a specific menu of policies, and those who don’t share this very specific set of goals are easily read out of the progressive movement, typecast as “neoliberals” or “corporate liberals.” This kind of rigidity is something that their progressive forerunners never exhibited. The progressive movement of the early 1900s was successful precisely because it was flexible and incorporated a wide range of views—so much so that the movement defies easy definition.

Indeed, historians have struggled for decades to characterize the progressive movement. Was it a coalition of middle-class reformers dedicated to good government? A top-down drive by politicians and businessmen to smooth out the sharper edges of industrial capitalism and blunt the appeal of socialism? The political project of urban working men and women who demanded better working and living conditions? A full assault against concentrated economic power? A case could be made for any of these interpretations.

In some ways, the progressive movement is hard to pin down because it was no movement at all, but rather an ever-shifting coalition of organized groups and individuals who agreed on certain issues and disagreed on others. They worked together and in opposition with equal fluidity and enjoyed strongholds within each of the two major political parties. Bound together by a common self-definition and guided by malleable principles, they entertained a diversity of thought and action. It was precisely this wide range of thought and action that made progressivism so powerful.



***

America at the turn of 20th century was a wealthy nation distinguished by widespread income inequality and a growing concentration of wealth and political power. Increasingly, it seemed, a small number of companies controlled access to and pricing for the goods and services that people consumed and dictated how much ordinary families took home in pay. Citizens welcomed the conveniences of new technology and a burgeoning consumer economy but fretted over their general loss of personal autonomy.

Visiting in 1900, an English traveler marveled that “life in the United States is a whirl of telephones, telegrams, phonographs, electric bells, motors, lifts, and automatic instruments.” In constant dollars, adjusted for inflation, the country’s gross national product grew from $11 billion in the 1880s to an eye-popping $84 billion by 1919. By the mid-1920s, almost two-thirds of American households were electrified, representing a dramatic break with the 19th century. It meant that the typical nonrural family (electricity still remained rare in the countryside) could replace hours of labor with the satisfying hum of the electric refrigerator or vacuum cleaner. Americans also ate better and more cheaply than ever before and had more money left over each month to indulge in mass-produced clothing and new “public amusements,” such as professional sporting events, dance halls, amusement parks and nickelodeons. “You just spent your summer canning in 1890,” recalled a housewife from Muncie, Indiana, “but the canned goods you buy today are so good that it isn’t worth your while to do so much.”

But prosperity did not beget equality. In 1890, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans claimed 51 percent of the nation’s real estate and property. Two decades later, the Brookings Institution found that 42 percent of households lived on the edge of rough subsistence. The combined income of the top 0.1 percent of families equaled that of the bottom 42 percent. Cyclical unemployment and underemployment were the norm for many working people. In other words, the material conditions associated with poverty had changed, but many people remained poor.

Business consolidation also created schisms. Between 1895 and 1905 alone, 157 holding companies swallowed thousands of independent businesses and came into control of 40 percent of the market share in their specific industry verticals. Men who had so recently enjoyed a modicum of autonomy as independent farmers and artisans bristled at the regimented and monotonous life of wage work, whether in mines, factories or offices. Working and living conditions in the nation’s bustling cities grew dangerous in the absence of regulation. Farmers chafed at the outsize influence of banks and railroads that dictated their cost basis and profit margins. People increasingly felt themselves powerless at work—helpless in the face of large, influential interests that controlled the nation’s economic life—and pawns in a political system rife with corruption and generally unresponsive to the needs of everyday Americans.

Little wonder, then, that the first two decades of the 20th century gave rise to a vibrant reform spirit that expressed itself in a wide spectrum of political, economic and social causes—from settlement houses, which provided social services to impoverished urban immigrants, and advocacy for public health improvements and municipal reform, to occupational safety regulations (particularly for women and children), the direct election of United States senators, statutes governing the food and drug industries, and crackdowns on economic trusts.

In some basic fashion, these various progressive causes reflected a dissatisfaction with the status quo and a determination to restore economic and political power to ordinary Americans. But to call it a “movement” belies the very clear divisions and points of divergence between the broad cast of characters who identified as progressives.

Some of these divisions are obvious. Rural farmers who championed railroad and bank regulation often had little sympathy for urban Americans—particularly new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe whose claims to both citizenship and whiteness seemed suspect. Though farmers principally blamed railroads and intermediaries like grain-elevator operators for their troubles—in 1908, a federal commission found that 80 percent of farmers felt they enjoyed no influence over the prices their products commanded—they often lashed out at distant cities, too. In 1900, dairy farmers withheld milk products from Boston until they could secure price increases; syndicates selling to wholesalers in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago soon applied their own supply boycotts.

William Jennings Bryan, a populist orator who helped ignite the farmer rebellion of the 1890s and later anchored progressive forces in Woodrow Wilson’s Cabinet, was a fierce opponent of large economic combinations—the hulking monopolies and holding companies that had come to dominate the nation’s economy—and supported a state takeover of railroads, arguing that “public ownership is necessary where competition is impossible.” These views were common among progressives, rural and urban alike, but there remained a sharp cleavage between town and country. Bryan tapped into a deep reserve of rural resentment when he famously thundered, “Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.”

Progressives were also divided on race and civil rights. Some prominent white progressives like Oswald Garrison Villard and Joel Spingarn—and, in his own halting way, Theodore Roosevelt—joined black progressives in championing civil rights. Others—notably, Wilson, the Virginia-born progressive president who segregated the federal workforce, and Rebecca Felton, an outspoken feminist from Georgia who became the first woman to serve in the United States Senate—were extreme proponents of Jim Crow laws. Felton famously argued that “if it takes lynching to protect women’s dearest possession from drunken ravening human beasts, then I say lynch a thousand a week.”

Self-styled progressives were also at odds over women’s suffrage. Social reformers, particularly many who came of political age in the settlement movement, agreed with Jane Addams, the founder of Hull-House in Chicago, that women required the vote to fulfill their traditional roles as mothers, wives and guardians of the home. In effect, they didn’t challenge the traditional idea of separate spheres for each gender but used that notion to demand a voice in public affairs. Municipal governments in the early 20th century were notoriously corrupt and inefficient; women, argued Addams and other progressive advocates of women's suffrage, required the vote to ensure the provision of adequate schools, parks, sanitation and building and work codes. Not all progressives agreed. One study of 400 self-identified progressive congressmen who served throughout the era found its respondents almost evenly split on suffrage. Given the central role women played in progressive politics, the struggle for women’s political rights created a notable and often bitter split in reform circles.

It wasn’t just that progressives—like nonprogressive Americans—were divided by region, race and gender. They also differed in how they understood the very meaning of progressivism. For many in the movement—like reform mayors such as Mark Fagan of Jersey City, New Jersey; Seth Low of New York; Tom Johnson of Cleveland; and Samuel “Golden Rule” Jones of Toledo, Ohio—progressivism was principally about checking the power of large interests and providing better and more honest government to citizens. For settlement house leaders like Addams and Florence Kelley, it was about empowering poor urban residents by improving the environment in which they lived.

Progressives even disagreed over so fundamental an issue as what representative democracy should look like. While many in the movement concerned themselves with the reinvigoration of America’s political institutions (the direct election of senators, for example—a landmark progressive achievement), other progressive causes demonstrated darker, antidemocratic tendencies.

In American cities, many of which were rife with mismanagement and corruption, progressives’ infatuation with expertise and organization led to several innovations designed to reduce the power of political machines and increase the power of individual citizens, including the short ballot, which reduced the number of offices up for election at one time, thereby allowing voters to research their options more thoroughly.

But in 1913, the city of Dayton, Ohio, went a step further and introduced the city manager model wherein elected officials delegated administrative authority and responsibilities to a professional manager who had not been elected. As often as not, city managers pulled authority from elected officials who represented growing immigrant and working-class populations. The city manager system might have combated a corrupt political machine, but it also took power from the voting public, generating fissures between working-class voters and middle-class reformers, even as they supported the same health, safety and workplace reforms.

In the same way that middle-class progressives favored managerial expertise over participatory democracy, they also invoked science and standards to lock working-class Americans out of white-collar professions. For many decades, the barrier to practice law or medicine had been low, in keeping with the democratic spirit of Jacksonian America. Yet by 1901, 25 states adopted progressive reforms that required specialized education and licensing for doctors and lawyers.

The process improved standards, but at a price. Institutions that trained women and African Americans failed to achieve or quickly lost accreditation, leaving the professional ranks more white, male and elite. In 1912, the American Bar Association expelled three recently admitted members after learning they were black—a “question of keeping pure the Anglo-Saxon race.” When Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a Jewish American, to the Supreme Court in 1916, ABA President Elihu Root, who had served as secretary of State under Theodore Roosevelt, andsix of the organization’s former presidents opposed the appointment. They reasoned that he lacked the proper character to serve.

One can see shades of these divisions in our current politics. It’s no less difficult today to sustain a diverse coalition that draws from the ranks of both middle-class professionals and working-class strivers. Their interests are not always aligned.



***

These fractures were on full display during the election of 1912, when two progressive candidates faced off against each other and against the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft. Running as the Democratic nominee was Wilson, whose closest adviser, Brandeis, was an outspoken opponent of trusts who believed that government should “regulate competition instead of monopoly, for our industrial and our civil freedom go hand in hand.” At the head of the breakaway Bull Moose Party, were Theodore Roosevelt and his adviser Herbert Croly, who accepted the enduring reality of economic trusts and championed an equally strong federal government to check their influence.

Americans—then and now—find the 1912 election confusing, as both candidates embraced many of the same policies: the abolition of child labor, new protections for workers and unions, a moderate tariff to boost American manufacturing, closer government regulation of the banking sector. Indeed, what makes progressivism so difficult to fathom is that its adherents were as often opposed as aligned, and even when they were aligned, they worked from a different set of principles.

However much they differed in background and disagreed on policy and principle, though, progressives shared a common faith. They tended to believe that systemic problems could be solved through study, scientific method and modern methods of governance and bureaucracy. Economists, sociologists and social workers flooded government commissions and offices, while “muckraking” journalists drew on the work of nonprofit think tanks to surface data that, they believed, would compel rational voters to action.



Progressives also shared a basic commitment to checking the rise of big business with the counterweight of organized producer and consumer groups.

Finally, progressives tended to view social disorder—as manifested by such urban ills as crime, vagrancy, spousal abandonment, drunkenness and unemployment—as a byproduct of environment rather than poor morals. This view represented a sharp break with earlier thinking that held individuals solely responsible for their lot in life.

In short, if there were no “progressive movement,” in the strict sense of the term, we can identify strains of a progressive persuasion. And progressives were, for a time, wildly successful. They achieved meaningful workplace, health and safety regulations; reformed the political system largely for the good; championed open space and conservation measures; and created a regulatory regime that was at least somewhat more capable of checking the growing concentration of corporate power and wealth.

But they didn’t achieve this with a single, inflexible voting bloc. Being a progressive in the opening years of the 20th century didn’t require strict adherence to a party line or blanket support for a set of specific legislative proposals. Because there was no progressive “movement,” in the singular and definitive meaning of the word, progressivism could draw freely from all sectors of society without demanding even broad consensus on basic questions like the morality of economic concentration or the right of women to vote. It was a malleable and shifting coalition of people who recognized common problems, believed in a rational and fact-based approach to resolving the challenges of modern society and animated public life with an innovative and optimistic spirit.

The same could be said of the New Deal coalition of the 1930s or the conservative coalition of the 1970s and 1980s, both of which drew from diverse wells of support and thought. Living history in real time, it was easy for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s and Ronald Reagan’s acolytes to believe their movements made perfect sense. But in retrospect, both have proved more difficult to describe with precision.

The lesson for today applies to people engaged in politics across the spectrum—from “new” progressives to free-market conservatives and just about everyone in the middle. Political moments that leave a lasting impression are often more complicated and textured than they seem in the moment. They defy easy definition. They’re made up of a common spirit more than by a legislative laundry list. That’s what makes them so compelling.

119,5 Ways Trump Has Remade the Democratic Party,John F. Harris,"Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images analysis 5 Ways Trump Has Remade the Democratic Party It’s not just Republicans the president has indelibly altered.

John F. Harris is founding editor of POLITICO and author of ""The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House.""

For years, a growing stripe of Democrats has argued that what their party needs is a leader willing to shatter old assumptions, a radical disrupter.

Well, Democrats already have found their transformational figure for the 2020 campaign. His name is Donald Trump.

Story Continued Below

No one could miss the obvious ways this president—despite his deviations from traditional conservative orthodoxy—has turned the Republican Party into the pro-Trump party. It could be easy to miss, however, some of the less obvious ways Trump also has made himself the defining force of the anti-Trump party.

All presidents tend to reshape the politics of their era, sometimes in ways that long outlast their time in office. JFK’s mastery of television infused once-dowdy progressive politics with a measure of glamour that politicians spent decades emulating; Ronald Reagan’s success in using well-turned anecdotes and homilies to drive a conservative movement shapes the presidency to this day.

It is striking, though, how true this has been even in the 2020 Democratic primary, in which the competition is over which candidate can most credibly claim that he or she will not just beat Trump but repudiate all he stands for.

On stylistic and even substantive grounds, Trump is arguably exerting more gravitational pull on Democratic politics than the party’s most recent president, Barack Obama, who left its down-ballot infrastructure in tatters, and far more than another Democratic figure, Bill Clinton, who once could claim that he had remade the party in his own fashion.

From the once-unthinkable candidates vying to replace this president to their mimicry of his hard-punching way of politics, Democrats are showing that it is possible—even unavoidable—simultaneously to loathe Trump and be swept along by his disruptive current. Here’s how Trump has indelibly altered how Democrats run for president:

1. Anyone's Plausible

The most immediate way Trump is driving the Democratic debate is in the size of the presidential field—unprecedentedly large—and in its diversity, filled with candidates who surely would have flunked the plausibility test in an earlier time.

The threshold question confronting any candidate is basically a matter of imagination: Does it seem conceivable this person could really be president of the United States?

That question will never be the same in a Trump context. What is inconceivable compared to a reality-TV star and habitue of the New York tabloids with a decadeslong trail of financial and sexual controversies?

Virtually every top-tier candidate on the Democratic side is benefiting to some degree from Trump’s demolition of old standards of presidential plausibility. Not long ago, a 77-year-old small-state socialist would have been deemed inconceivable, but Bernie Sanders is not. So would a 37-year mayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana, but Pete Buttigieg is not. Nor Texan Beto O’Rourke, who made few waves in three terms in Congress and did not win his statewide race. Nor Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Massachusetts law professor who didn’t run for office until she was in her 60s, nor Julián Castro, who in years past would find few takers that his time as HUD secretary was a likely path to commander in chief. Even the most conventional pol, former Vice President Joe Biden, would at age 76 three decades after his first presidential run be seen as a highly improbable contender.

Some version of, “Well, if Trump can win … ” is the principal engine behind the fact that there are two dozen candidates—a number that itself would have been wildly improbable. In fact, it is candidates with impressive traditional credentials—senators like Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet and governors like Jay Inslee and John Hickenlooper—who are struggling most to clear the give-me-a-break bar.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/2275/1155968404_5999037774001_5999041282001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Trump’s example has not only broadened the standards of presidential qualifications, but is helping erase old lines about disqualifications—unofficial standards that were nonetheless primly enforced by political insiders and the news media. If O’Rourke’s presidential campaign flops, it won’t be because arrests (charges later dropped) for drunken driving and burglary from the 1990s were an obstacle to his campaign, nor is the fact that Kamala Harris once publicly dated a married man (then-San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown) around the same time. The more recent controversy over whether Biden is too handsy and familiar in ways that made some women uncomfortable has passed quickly. Never mind the phenomenon of Andrew Yang, whose geekiness would have made him a laughingstock in years past; or that of spiritual guru Marianne Williamson, who will likely make the debate stage along with sitting lawmaker Kirsten Gillibrand and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.

Simply put, it is impossible to imagine the current field or the broader story arc of the Democratic race so far were it not for Trump shattering traditional norms.

2. Cable Is King

Speaking of outdated norms, there was once a president who made it is his signature to boast about his dignified distance from the raucous uproars and obsessions du jour of the modern media cycle. That president was Obama, who struck a superior air while boasting constantly of his indifference to “cable chatter.”

But it is impossible to imagine Obama’s successor becoming president without his fixation with cable television—by many reports he watches several hours daily, and even records his favorite shows—and his mastery over how to manipulate the hyperaccelerated news cycle powered by the social media-cable ouroboros.

When Trump’s rise from noisy celebrity to presidential contender began four years ago, his path was cable—not simply the televised debates of 2015 and 2016, but the way his performances dominated channels for days afterward. Every Democratic presidential candidate, including Biden as front-runner, is acutely conscious of the need to perform well at cable debates starting next month, and along the way to demonstrate that they are capable of competing with Trump on equal terms in the general election battle of media narratives. No Democrat could credibly claim to be indifferent to “cable chatter,” or would regard that as something to boast about.

3. Message Discipline Is for Losers

Not long ago, one of the paramount tests of effective campaigns was “message discipline,” the ability to stay on one’s own themes and avoid getting dragged into the daily rumpus. Operatives worked to make sure their candidate always managed to seem “presidential”—that is, with a certain dignified reserve and detachment from the seamier parts of the business.

To paraphrase Ronald Reagan (“We are the change”) Trump can credibly boast: “I am the rumpus.”

And with the possible exception of Biden, there aren’t any top-tier candidates on the Democratic side laboring to stay above the fray.

This has a substantive component, seen in the way candidates jostle with each other to be first to break from the crowd on questions like whether Trump should be impeached or whether they endorse the “Green New Deal” unveiled by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey. As a Washington Post writer recently noted, it used to be virtually unheard of for presidential candidates to attack corporations and their leaders by name. But following Trump’s lead, Democratic candidates routinely unload on such companies as Amazon, ExxonMobil and Facebook.

The stylistic dimension is even more vivid. Pre-Trump, operatives likely would have worried that Pete Buttigieg’s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, was making a spectacle of himself on social media with his free associations about their pet dogs, his Harry Potter obsession, the guy drinking ginger ale next to him on an airline flight, as well as more reflective posts on what the campaign has meant to him. As it is, the candidate’s spouse’s fluency on Twitter makes him an important asset. O’Rourke is mocked in some quarters for livestreaming his haircut, but on balance his willingness to share his fascination with self on social media is considered a good thing. Even Elizabeth Warren is tweeting videos of throwing back beers or greeting her dog.

Trump has firmly set the precedent that if a thought is on his mind it is on his keyboard; even as most Democrats don’t emulate his regular stream of insults they are plainly in debt to his example. Understatement and reserve as signatures of a presidential style are in the past.

4. Deficits Don’t Matter

A few days before Obama was sworn in at his first inaugural, he gave an interview with the Washington Post during which he was at pains to emphasize his commitment to fiscal discipline. He announced a “fiscal responsibility summit” and, expanding on rhetoric from the campaign, said he was determined to address unsustainable costs to entitlement programs like Social Security “under my watch” rather than “kick the can down the road.”

That’s a reminder that even progressive leaders used to feel an obligation to match their appeals for expensive new domestic spending with furrowed-brow professions about how they realized there is a cost to everything. These statements were aimed not so much at conservatives but at moderates within the Democratic Party.

Trump has offered scant evidence rhetorically or substantively that he cares about budget deficits or entitlements costs. This has given Democratic presidential candidates a green light to blow off these questions, too. No top-tier Democrat is emphasizing deficit reduction or cost-control, and they are under no particular pressure from the media or voters to do so. Instead the competition is over who can present the most ambitious and pulse-quickening ideas—‘Medicare for All,’ free college, teacher raises, massive infrastructure investment and so on. That is a change from the environment faced by Hillary Clinton, Obama, John Kerry or Bill Clinton in their turns as nominees, and Democrats have Trump to thank.

5. Being a Uniter Is So Yesterday

Trump did not create the ultrapartisan politics with which he is so associated—this had been building for a quarter-century or more before his election. One difference with him, however, is that most of the time he never pays rhetorical deference to the notion of the presidency as a national unifier.

Every president from George H.W. Bush (“a kinder, gentler nation”) to Bill Clinton (who said he wanted to be “a repairer of the breach”) to George W. Bush (“I’m a uniter, not a divider”) to Obama (“There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; There’s the United States of America”) produced signature lines emphasizing the desire to bridge differences. Hillary Clinton called herself a “progressive who gets things done” by working with all sides.

This kind of rhetoric is largely absent from the Democratic contest. The partial exception, again, is Biden, and he is learning fast about the perils of offering himself as bridge-builder at a time when even many party moderates believe that Trump Republicans are so not on the level there is no point in trying to get along. His statement that Vice President Mike Pence is personally “a decent guy” caused an online uproar on the left and forced Biden to say he didn’t think Pence’s policies or politics were decent.

It was a reminder that Biden, probably more than any candidate, formed his political sensibilities in an earlier era—and long before many Democrats concluded that the right way to beat Trump is by embracing the reality that he has changed the way to run for president.

120,Opinion | The Wayward Special Counsel,Rich Lowry,"Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo opinion The Wayward Special Counsel

Rich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.





In the end, the by-the-book Robert Mueller wildly departed from the book.

He invented an extraconstitutional legal standard for his obstruction investigation and acted, at the very least, in violation of the spirit of the special counsel regulations.

Story Continued Below

His departing act was a public statement meant to influence the public debate in a manner inappropriate for a prosecutor, in part because the public report he wrote that was inappropriate for a prosecutor failed to achieve clarity despite its hundreds of pages.

A hallmark of the Trump era is that the norm-defying president goads everyone appalled by him to violate norms. The retired Marine and former G-man would seem least likely to fall prey to this dynamic, but here we are: He has put on a master class in how a prosecutor shouldn’t behave.

First and foremost, Mueller ditched the presumption of innocence, a bedrock of the American legal system. In the normal course of things, all of us are considered innocent unless a jury finds us guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Mueller switched this around. Rather than finding conclusive evidence of Trump’s guilt, he had to find conclusive evidence of his innocence. Because he didn’t find this exculpatory evidence, he deemed Trump “not exonerated,” a standard heretofore unknown to the American system.

As he put it in his news conference, in surely one of the more gobsmacking utterances ever made by someone from a Justice Department podium, “If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”

If this standard had been applied to any person other than Donald Trump, it would have been widely denounced and the American Civil Liberties Union would be crusading to keep it from ever emerging again in any context in America.

It is profoundly inimical to due process as understood under our Constitution and puts the burden of proof on the accused—exactly what our system seeks to avoid.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/1707/1155968404_6042351574001_6042350053001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Naturally, Trump’s critics concluded from Mueller’s statement that if Trump hadn’t been found innocent, he must be guilty. The snarky headline on a New York magazine piece put it aptly enough, “Mueller: Trump is Not Not a Criminal.”

Well, you might say, of course Mueller departed from standard operating procedure—he’s a special counsel operating in novel circumstances that require novel approaches.

But this is not his writ. A special counsel, under the regulations, is not a freelancer making it up as he goes along. He has the “investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States attorney.” He is supposed to “comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”

It is one of the those rules that has caused so much confusion over the obstruction portion of the Mueller report. The DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel has said a sitting president can’t be charged with a crime. Mueller explained in his public statement that this ruling led his office to conclude it could “not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime.”

So, Mueller by his own account, conducted a two-year investigation knowing from the beginning that he wouldn’t make the either/or decision that prosecutors exist to make. Attorney General William Barr was right when he told the Senate Judiciary Committee, “At the end of the day, the federal prosecutor must decide yes or no.” Mueller decided neither.

Mueller offered several reasons in his statement for conducting an obstruction investigation anyway. One was to preserve evidence. But for what? The idea that Trump, after losing reelection in 2020, would be prosecuted as a private citizen for firing FBI Director James Comey is manifestly absurd. Another was that a president can be accused of wrongdoing in “a process other than the criminal justice system,” i.e., impeachment by Congress.

Here, Mueller is basically describing Volume 2 as an impeachment referral. But this isn’t a purpose contemplated by the special counsel regulations, which, again, were written to tether special counsels to Justice Department practice.

The regulations say that the special counsel “shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions.” They don’t say a special counsel shall fail to reach a prosecution or declination decision, then write a long report for congressional consumption anyway and go out and make a public statement to catalyze congressional action if he thinks his report is being misread.

That Mueller was effectively conducting an impeachment inquiry from within the executive branch represented a significant distortion of our system. It should be up to Congress, not an inferior executive branch official who’s the functional equivalent of a U.S. attorney, to launch such an inquiry. Even more bizarrely, because Mueller considered Trump’s public statements as potential obstruction, any objections by the president to this quasi-impeachment inquiry were more evidence of alleged wrongdoing.

An institutionalist who lost his way, Mueller will be lionized for the duration because he’s been so useful to Trump’s opposition, but his performance won’t age well—and shouldn’t.","Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo opinion The Wayward Special CounselRich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.

121,Why Trump’s Stonewalling Legal Strategy Will Keep Failing,Renato Mariotti,"Renato Mariotti is the Legal Affairs Columnist for POLITICO Magazine. He is a former federal prosecutor and host of the “On Topic” podcast.

In the space of three days this week, two federal judges ruled decisively in favor of Congress’ right to subpoena President Donald Trump’s personal financial and business records. The speed of the decisions—unusual in complex federal litigation—demonstrates a significant flaw in the administration’s “fight all the subpoenas” strategy. More importantly, it suggests that Trump’s strategy of categorically fighting all congressional subpoenas will undermine his ability to stonewall Congress in subsequent cases.

Already, one of the rulings has been appealed by the Trump administration, and a three-judge panel is scheduled to hear the case in July. In the meantime, however, we are witnessing profound legal decisions in defense of congressional power. If Trump’s stonewalling strategy was intended to run out the clock by forcing Democrats into interminable court fights, it appears so far to be having the exact opposite effect—almost like a little league game that gets called early because one team is scoring too many unanswered runs.

Story Continued Below

On Monday, federal Judge Amit Mehta issued a sweeping decision rejecting Trump’s personal challenge to a House Oversight Committee subpoena of his financial records from an accounting firm he has used. The main argument Trump advanced was that there was no legislative purpose for the subpoena.

Mehta made quick work of that argument, noting that courts have long held that they must presume Congress is acting to legislate. But Trump’s argument went further, claiming that Congress is engaging in “law enforcement” and that corrupt behavior by the president is not a “proper subject of investigation.” Mehta cited Watergate as an obvious rebuttal.

Trump’s argument is doomed to fail in the courts because the Constitution gives the House the “full power of impeachment” and it could not exercise that authority without investigating presidential wrongdoing. Mehta found that it is “simply not fathomable” that “a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a president for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Wednesday’s ruling by Judge Edgardo Ramos made equally quick work of Trump’s argument that subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One for his records lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose.” He found that argument “unpersuasive,” finding that it was “not the role of the judicial branch to question [Congress’] motives.” He denied every one of Trump’s requests.

What is remarkable about these sweeping rulings is not the results, which were expected, but the speed with which they were issued. Mehta issued his 41-page ruling just seven days after hearing arguments.

If Trump’s team is not alarmed by the speed and sweeping nature—not to mention the almost dismissive tone—of the two judgments against the president, it should be. Trump’s strategy on a variety of fronts has been to take extreme positions denying congressional authority to investigate the president. On Monday, for example, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the president’s senior advisers are immune from subpoenas to testify about their official duties. Buried on Page 9 of the memo was an admission that the only court to consider this issue had ruled to the contrary. Hiding an unfavorable precedent in this manner might work on a first-year law student, but it won’t fool a federal judge.

Last week, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, arguing against having to produce the full Mueller Report and underlying materials, said the House Judiciary Committee lacked any “legislative purpose” for investigating Trump’s conduct as detailed in the Mueller report. He accused the House Judiciary of conducting a “pseudo law enforcement investigation.” Sound familiar?

The Achilles' heel of Trump’s strategy is that his extreme positions are not fact-specific or nuanced and are easily disposed of as legally groundless. Mehta noted that the “legal issues presented do not require the court to resolve any fact contests because the material facts are not in dispute.” Because Trump challenged the very right of Congress to investigate these matters, the only facts the court needed to consider were basic facts that no one could possibly dispute.

That stands in stark contrast to prior disputes between the executive branch and Congress. For example, the dispute over certain materials subpoenaed by Congress in its investigation of Operation Fast and Furious resulted in litigation that took eight years to resolve. But the Obama administration did not take the categorical, aggressive approach that Trump has. Obama’s Justice Department produced some witnesses and documents and fought over other documents over which it claimed privilege.

If Trump continues down this path—over former White House counsel Don McGahn’s refusal to appear before the House Judiciary, for example—expect to see more swift rulings swatting down his legal arguments in the coming weeks and months. No court is going to rule that the executive branch can categorically refuse to produce evidence and witnesses from a criminal investigation of the president of the United States to the House of Representatives.

Trump’s team no doubt believes that once its initial arguments fail, it will advance more nuanced arguments that seek to protect only a limited subset of material from disclosure. But as any experienced litigator knows, a judge’s impression of a party’s position is influenced by the history of the litigation. Because Trump’s lawyers have not even paid lip service to our constitutional system at the outset, judges will be less inclined to take their arguments seriously later on. In addition, the decisions issued by judges denying Trump’s challenges will influence other judges considering similar challenges brought by Trump against other congressional subpoenas.

Trump has appointed hundreds of federal judges, many of whom undoubtedly share his expansive view of executive power. One of his appointees, Neomi Rao, sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which will hear arguments about the Mehta ruling. But Trump has made it difficult for judges to show him the deference that courts might otherwise show the president.

For that reason, a savvy litigator would not roll the dice with the risky legal strategy Trump has advanced. A more sophisticated approach would be to make limited accommodations to Congress and advance very fact-specific objections to congressional subpoenas that would require a court to engage in a time-consuming inquiry to parse through. Trump’s current strategy lacks that sophistication.

As a result, his strategy is not only generating adverse results quickly, but it could very well convince a court that he is acting in bad faith. If that happens, the House could get the courts to do what it is ill-equipped to do itself: enforce compliance with congressional subpoenas. That could get congressional investigations, or even an impeachment inquiry, off the ground.

122,How a MAGA Stunt Became a Very Real Border Wall,Ben Schreckinger,"Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.

SUNLAND PARK, N.M. — Down a bumpy dirt road, past a dozen “No Trespassing” signs, two amateur sentries in neon safety vests guarded the way to a giant symbol of Trump-era politics rising up from the Chihuahuan Desert.

After one of the guards Armando asked our business and radioed someone called Viper, telling him to “stand down,” we were waved through a makeshift checkpoint and onto the site where supporters of President Donald Trump have built hundreds of yards of border wall on private land overlooking the Rio Grande.

Story Continued Below

What began in December as a quixotic online crowdfunding effort to get Trump’s promised “big, beautiful wall” built has turned into a physical barrier constructed under the direction of influential right-wing immigration opponents. On Wednesday, its backers demonstrated the wall to a handful of reporters, showing off the structure in all its steel-and-concrete glory ahead of an official ribbon-cutting ceremony on Thursday.

Its organizers insist their version of the wall is a feasible model for securing hundreds of miles of southern border. Its critics call it a xenophobic scam. The fact that the effort has gotten to this point at all suggests a different and broader truth: That in the Trump era, the line between a surreal stunt and an important political development can be extremely blurry.

On Wednesday, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach offered a tour of the wall — at one point scrambling over crumbling hillside to demonstrate the difficulty of passing the terrain — while negotiating with local officials over a permitting issue that threatened to derail construction.

At the same time, Kobach has been overseeing legal aspects of the project, now housed under a nonprofit called We Build the Wall, he has been negotiating with the White House over a possible appointment as the nation’s actual “immigration czar,” a potential new post that could give him vast influence over the federal bureaucracy.

Last week, The New York Times reported a list of Kobach’s conditions for accepting the job, which included 24/7 access to a government plane and were reportedly viewed as presumptuous by some inside the administration. On Wednesday, Kobach defended those conditions. “If you're serious about solving this problem you've got to have a position that has the authority and the tools to solve the problem,” he told me.

He also said he is “99 percent” certain he knows who leaked the list, though he did not offer any names.

Kobach said he last spoke to Trump about the wall project in the Oval Office three weeks ago, and that the president drilled him on the technical specifications, expressing special interest in their model’s anti-climbing features, a set of horizontal steel plates covering the tops of the wall’s vertical slats. “Are you going to paint it?” Kobach recalled the president asking him.

The wall stands on the same stretch of border where an armed militia group, the United Constitutional Patriots, was recently detaining migrants as they enter the United States. Kobach and other leaders of the wall project said they are not associated with the militias and do not condone armed vigilante action. They argue that putting up walls will put such groups “out of business.”

But his disavowals have not been entirely embraced by the movement. “I don’t support that sort of activity—yet,” said conservative pundit David Clarke, a former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, who works on public outreach for the project. “I’m real close,” said Clarke, who said that if there is not a more significant migration crackdown by the end of Trump’s first term, he would endorse vigilante action.

There also appears to be some intermingling of the militia group and the wall efforts. We Build the Wall has shared footage shot by the group online, and people associated with the group continue to make appearances at the site of the private wall project, despite intense scrutiny of the militia’s activities.

On Wednesday evening, Jim Benvie, previously the spokesman for the United Constitutional Patriots, and now with a splinter group called the Guardian Patriots, showed up at the construction site. Benvie took issue with the group being described as “militia” or “vigilante.” He said the groups operated legally and complained that media coverage of the groups had been misleading. “There is a big difference between carrying a gun and pointing a gun,” he said.

Further blurring the lines between government and private efforts, Border Patrol vehicles constantly whizzed around the property.

The contractor building the private wall section, Fisher Industries, is using it as a show project in the hope of winning government contracts. We Build the Wall organizers said they designed the wall with input from Border Patrol agents, whose charge includes patrolling private land on the border.

A spokesman for Customs and Border Patrol said that Fisher Industries had notified the agency of the project. “It is not uncommon for vendors to undertake demonstrations of their capabilities utilizing their own resources,” said the CBP spokesman. “ We encourage all interested vendors to compete for border barrier contracts through established mechanisms to ensure any construction is carried out under relevant federal authorities and meets USBP operational requirements for border barrier.”

Along with Benvie and various We Build the Wall organizers, members of the media, laborers, and assorted activists milled about amid heavy construction equipment as large SUVs and pickup trucks came and went around the sprawling site. The property abuts Monument One, a white obelisk that marks the point where Mexico, New Mexico and Texas all meet.

Jeff Allen, co-owner of the brick company that owns the land, patrolled the property but declined to be interviewed, saying his words had been “twisted every time” he spoke to the media.

Susan Moore, 56, a retired EMS worker, strode around the site with a .45 revolver strapped to her hip, collecting signatures for two petitions, one advocating a border wall and another opposing a New Mexico state measure to impose stricter background checks on gun purchases. Asked how she connected with the wall-builders, Moore, a member of a Tea Party-type group called New Mexico Patriots, offered just a one-word response. “Networking,” she said, and left it at that.

Members of “Angel Families,” a group made up of relatives of those killed by undocumented immigrants that Trump regularly invokes, also toured the site.

The project began in December as a GoFundMe campaign started by Florida man Brian Kolfage, a decorated Air Force veteran who had operated conspiratorially minded right-wing websites that were banned from Facebook. Kolfage initially intended the money for the Treasury Department, to be earmarked for wall construction, but after discovering this was not legally feasible, he established a nonprofit to build the border wall on private land with a roster of anti-immigration figures that included Blackwater founder Erik Prince, former Colorado GOP Rep. Tom Tancredo and retired major league pitcher Curt Schilling, now a right-wing radio personality.

On Memorial Day, the group revealed on “Fox and Friends” that it had begun construction on this parcel of land. That news prompted the mayor here to issue a cease-and-desist order on Tuesday, which by Wednesday evening had been resolved with an agreement to obtain permits and resume construction. The hubbub renewed national media interest in the project.

In an interview on CNN on Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke — a former Texas congressman whose El Paso district sits right over the Texas side of the border from the private wall, and who often praises the benefits of exchange with Mexico — was asked about the project. “I think what you do on your private property, including building a wall, is your business, so good for them,” O’Rourke said, while reiterating his opposition to a federally constructed wall.

On Thursday, POLITICO reported that Trump was considering new asylum rules that would block Central American migrants from entering the U.S., and Trump, on Twitter, threatened to slap tariffs on Mexico until it halted the flow of Central American migrants through its territory.

At the wall site, the contingent of guards at the site’s entrance doubled to four on Thursday, and one was armed. Construction had resumed and dozens of laborers worked at the top of the wall, while at its base, organizers covered the concrete in front of the wall in red carpet and held a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Trump’s estranged former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who serves as chairman of We Build the Wall’s advisory board, had been scheduled to attend Thursday’s ribbon-cutting, but by email he said he was still in London. On Wednesday, the Guardian reported that Bannon was quoted in Michael Wolff’s new book as saying Trump will be brought down by financial investigations that reveal “He is just another scumbag.”

""This wall exemplifies the 'can-do' spirit of the American people,” wrote Bannon in an email. He did not address a request for comment on the Wolff quotes.

123,Kirsten Gillibrand’s Failure to Launch,Tim Alberta,"Tim Alberta is chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine.

HAMPTON, New Hampshire—Kirsten Gillibrand is only asking for a dollar.

It’s not that she couldn’t use more money. In the first quarter of 2019, the junior senator from New York raised just $3 million for her presidential campaign, the weakest haul of the six senators running at that time and arguably one of the most disappointing totals of anyone in the sprawling Democratic field. Given her anemic polling since entering the race, Gillibrand’s feeble fundraising performance fanned skepticism about her viability to earn a nomination that Democrats believe will require close to $100 million in hard money raised.

Story Continued Below

But at this point, Gillibrand isn’t focused on winning the primary. She’s worried about surviving the next few months.

Despite a soaring national profile in the U.S. Senate, Gillibrand has failed to achieve liftoff as a presidential prospect. She has not broken 2 percent in a single national poll since officially declaring her candidacy in mid-March, and her 0.4 percent average in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of surveys places her behind the likes of Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard and even geeky long shot Andrew Yang.

Her bigger problem is fundraising. To secure a spot in the first double-header of Democratic primary debates in late June, candidates must meet two thresholds: surpassing 1 percent in three recognized national polls and collecting 65,000 unique campaign contributions. Gillibrand has checked the first box, however unimpressively. Yet the second mission remains unaccomplished. With the debates closing in—and with even quixotic candidates such as self-help guru Marianne Williamson hitting the 65,000-donor mark—Gillibrand is under the gun. The Democratic National Committee is limiting the total number of participants to 20. She could (and likely will) qualify by meeting the polling threshold only. But given the late gusher of contenders entering the fray, her place on stage can be guaranteed only by growing her donor ranks—and quickly.

Melissa Lyttle for Politico Magazine

Which brings Gillibrand to the climax of her stump speech. It’s the second weekend of May, she’s addressing a standing room-only crowd at a micro-pub four miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and the senator has finally hit her stride. Whether it’s the booze flowing from the taps or some other environmental factor—OK, it’s the booze—this has been Gillibrand’s best event of the day. Her talking points are sharp. Her jokes are well executed. Her audience is energized and engaged. Candidates typically fade late in a long day on the campaign trail, but Gillibrand has gotten stronger. The voters are hanging on her every word—about reforming the EPA, battling the NRA, encouraging national service programs and confronting Russian aggression. Finally, Gillibrand decides, it’s time to make the ask.

“For anyone here, if you like what you’ve heard tonight, I want to earn my place on the debate stage. I can’t do it unless you send a dollar—literally, really,” Gillibrand says, shaking her head as though to acknowledge the oddity of this request. “The measure is for anyone who wants to be on the debate stage, you need to get 65,000 individual supporters. So please go to KirstenGillibrand.com and just send a dollar. It will help me get to the debate stage.”

Gillibrand isn’t the only 2020 hopeful who has resorted to this method. Tim Ryan’s website features pop-up advertisements asking for $1. And Michael Bennet’s spots on social media make an identical solicitation.

But that’s Tim Ryan and Michael Bennet—an obscure congressman and low-profile senator, respectively. Ryan’s chief claim to relevance is being slaughtered by Nancy Pelosi as the sacrificial lamb who challenged her in the speaker’s race on behalf of disgruntled House Democrats after the 2016 election. Bennet has done little to distinguish himself as a senator and won his Colorado seat in 2010 only because the GOP snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, nominating a self-destructive Tea Party candidate whom Bennet managed to defeat by some 30,000 votes.

Gillibrand plays in a different league—or at least, she was supposed to.



***

A Dartmouth-educated lawyer who worked in corporate law before clerking on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Gillibrand gained national attention upon entering the political arena for possessing a rare combination of big brains, telegenic looks and personal magnetism. Her storming of a conservative upstate New York congressional district in 2006 announced her arrival as a player in Washington, and it was little surprise when, a few years later, after Hillary Clinton’s appointment as secretary of state, Gillibrand was tapped to replace her in the Senate. After winning her own full term in 2012—racking up the largest statewide victory in the history of New York politics—Gillibrand set about overhauling her political brand.

It wouldn’t be easy to shed the image responsible for her House victories—that of a down-home, gun-friendly, anti-amnesty, culturally conservative Democrat who identified with her rural constituents more than with the party’s coastal elite. But slowly, methodically, Gillibrand did just that, smartly picking and choosing fights that would burnish her populist progressive bona fides while elevating her national stature. She co-directed the effort that banned insider trading among members of Congress. She was an integral part of the campaign to repeal the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that governed gays in the military. She introduced pioneering legislation aimed at ensuring paid family leave. And she became Washington’s leading voice on sexual assault, first by focusing on cases in the military and then broadening to harness the energy generated by the #MeToo movement.

All the while, she raised tens of millions of dollars, wrote a New York Times bestseller and was named one of Time’s 100 most influential people in the world.

As it became clear that Gillibrand was preparing to launch a campaign for the presidency in 2020, the only question seemed to be the height of the senator’s ceiling. Could she win the Democratic nomination? And if so, could she succeed where her friend and former mentor, Hillary Clinton, failed four years earlier?

Today, the question is whether Gillibrand can get off the floor.

In a conversation for POLITICO’s “Off Message” podcast, the New York senator vacillated between insinuating that she is being treated differently because of her gender and arguing that Americans are ready for a female president.

“Hillary won the election. She won the popular vote by 3 million votes, and you have to remember, she was definitely the most qualified candidate we’d ever had running for president,” Gillibrand says. “And, but for Russia, but for Comey, but for misogyny, but for a lot of things, she would have won. So, I believe that of course this country is ready to elect a woman president, but they need to know what we’re running on and what we’re for, and why we’re running and why we think we’re the best candidate.”

Yet Gillibrand has struggled to communicate this to voters. Things have gotten so grim for her that recently, a high-ranking campaign aide to Cory Booker—Gillibrand’s opponent for the Democratic nomination—tweeted that she had donated to the New York senator’s campaign and encouraged others to follow suit. This was done, the aide noted, to ensure that Gillibrand’s “important perspective is on the debate stage.” To other Democrats, this looked less like an act of short-term benevolence than one of long-term strategy: The historically large field will soon begin to be winnowed, and when it does, some of the surprising early exits will make for valuable endorsements. No name has surfaced in those conversations of late more frequently than Gillibrand.

How did it come to this? How did one of America’s best-financed senators come to rely on charity and presidential pan-handling, begging for a dollar at a time just to stay alive? How did one of Washington’s most recognizable women find herself buried in the polls beneath a number of less prominent men? And how does she breathe life into her campaign before it’s too late?

Gillibrand and I discussed this, and much more, while having lunch in Manchester, in the car while driving to Goffstown and over a beer during her final stop of the day in Hampton.

Gillibrand claims, like all candidates do, that she’s having the time of her life campaigning for the highest office in the land. And yet her cheerful demeanor cannot mask the annoyance she is feeling—with the media, with the gender dynamics central to the race, and with the Democratic Party itself.

Gillibrand clearly doesn’t think much of the DNC’s rules governing the debates. Even before the national party announced the stricter criteria candidates would need to meet to qualify for the third and fourth debates this fall—effectively putting an expiration date on more than half of the Democratic candidacies—Gillibrand took issue with the emphasis on early polling to shape a process that has commenced far earlier that it once did.

“The last couple of presidential candidates who were Democrats who won, or even are nominees, you had to look at where they were at this early stage. I think somebody looked up where Bill Clinton was at this stage. He had 1 percent in the polls and had 30 percent name recognition in Iowa. So, like, it takes time,” Gillibrand said. “And with 20 candidates, it might actually take longer … because for each one of us to have a chance to be heard it’s going to take time. I mean, even the debates alone, if we get more than five minutes each on that stage, that’ll be surprising. So, you’re really even not even going to have more than a few minutes to talk about what you’re for and why you’re running and what your views are for the country.”

Gillibrand argues that both of the debate thresholds, polling and unique contributions, “are related to name recognition.” But she certainly is better known than the likes of Yang, or Williamson, or Gabbard, or Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, the latest 2020 candidate to “double qualify” by reaching both qualification milestones. Working the referees this early isn’t a sign of strategic savvy; it’s a sign of desperation.

Asked about the pressure she’s feeling, Gillibrand said it’s “created because of the DNC’s framework that they’ve put the candidates under,” which she suggests isn’t the “natural” or “normal” role for a national party. Asked whether she disagrees with the DNC’s rules, she replied, “I’m not sure. I don’t know that they’re serving the public well.”

Meanwhile, compounding Gillibrand’s frustration is her fraught relationship with the political issue that has defined her ascent: gender.

When I asked whether it was problematic to have so many white men—Beto O’Rourke, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg—soaking up the media spotlight, she replied, “Yeah, I think it’s problematic. …. We have amazing women candidates, amazing candidates of color, and hopefully through this process we will lift our voices up and be heard.”

The look on her face when I mentioned O’Rourke’s appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair was beyond description. “Unusual,” she finally mustered, biting her lip and her tongue at once, a litany of curse words no doubt suppressed underneath her smirk. “Never seen it before.”

And when I asked Gillibrand to name the worst part of running for president, she replied, “I don’t want to tell you.” She added that “it’s not an appropriate thing for me to say,” then promised to tell me later, off the record.

After hearing the off-the-record answer, I pressed for a sanitized version, which she offered in the most measured of tones. “The one thing that’s annoying to me is how many times reporters ask you about our male colleagues. Who cares? I’m running for president. I want to tell you what my vision is, why I’m running, and why I’m going to win,” she said. “I think reporters like yourself, who are super smart and super careful, will always ask me what I think about the male colleagues. Are you asking the male colleagues what they think about us? Probably not.”

The one thing that’s annoying to me is how many times reporters ask you about our male colleagues. Who cares? I’m running for president. I want to tell you what my vision is, why I’m running, and why I’m going to win,” Gillibrand said. “Are you asking the male colleagues what they think about us? Probably not.”

This is the hang-up of Gillibrand’s campaign. Never has the Democratic electorate been more exercised by issues of identity, and never has gender been more central to the national conversation—politically, culturally, socioeconomically and otherwise. And yet Gillibrand, despite having very little to lose at this point, remains cautious in interviews and on the stump—aiming for broad appeal instead of a niche brand, trying to draw in support from every cell of the party rather than cultivating a base and building out.

At every stop in New Hampshire, the senator was careful to modulate her answers and her tone in ways that would render her universally acceptable. She talks of how she dominated the blue boroughs of New York City—but also how she carried the state’s red, rural counties. She believes Trump is a “coward”—but she wants to calm the vitriolic nature of our politics. Gillibrand didn’t shy away from a single proposal—whether it was expanding the Supreme Court, increasing funding for indigenous groups or signing a breast cancer-related pledge—that voters asked her about.

Yet when it came to addressing the gender bias she believes is inherent to politics—a belief shared by many younger progressive women, a sizable chunk of the Democratic coalition—Gillibrand held back. Had her off-the-record answer been published, it would have gone viral overnight, racking up hundreds of thousands of clicks and instantly erasing any concerns about her small-donor disparity. But Gillibrand chose to be careful. Having won in a red district, having persuaded older, whiter, Republican audiences to support her in the past, she believes she can do so again.



***

The problem for Gillibrand is, the polls and the fundraising numbers show that this cautious approach isn’t getting her anywhere. The over-50 male demographic in Iowa and New Hampshire is likely to lean toward candidates such as Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, or perhaps even Elizabeth Warren, whose paeans to economic populism resonate with the dwindling remnant of blue-collar Democrats. The market Gillibrand was poised to corner—after becoming Washington’s leading voice on women’s rights issues and embracing the risk of calling for Al Franken’s resignation from the Senate—was that of the young, female voters who have mobilized the backlash to Donald Trump’s presidency.

Instead, in an overflowing field with more than 20 candidates slicing and dicing the electorate every which way, Gillibrand seems to believe that she can’t afford to alienate any one bloc of voters.

If the recent controversies surrounding new state-based abortion laws are any indication, it’s a tactical misreading of the race. Gillibrand’s forceful denunciations, on social media and cable news programs, earned her more free media coverage than anything else since the launch of her campaign. It was a reminder that she is more comfortable than any of the other Democrats in speaking to women’s issues, having not only mastered the messaging but worked extensively on the policies regarding everything from pay equality to workplace discrimination.

In that instance, Gillibrand seized the opportunity to gain headlines and eyeballs—and most likely, campaign donations—by owning an issue of visceral importance to what should be her core base of supporters.

Still, she seems conscious of doing so infrequently, wary of being typecast as a single-issue candidate. In a vacuum, for a generic Democratic woman candidate hoping to defeat Trump in a November election, it’s not necessarily a bad idea to downplay the talk of glass ceilings. And yet, for a female Democratic candidate like Gillibrand, whose image is heavily colored by her fights for gender equality, winning the party’s nomination—and the right to challenge Trump—might require a greater reliance on her identity.

This is the paradox of Gillibrand’s candidacy. She believes, as do many of her Democratic rivals, that voters want “electability” in a nominee—someone who above all else will defeat Trump in 2020. And she does have a case to make in that regard: As a former upstate congresswoman, she does have a feel for the nonideological challenges facing rural and poor America. And at her core, layers beneath the questions about her political evolution, she is inherently relatable, someone who quotes Scripture as easily as she sips a beer or rocks a baby.

But Gillibrand’s emphasis on long-term electability may be coming at the expense of her short-term viability. She has chosen not to pursue with reckless abandon the demographic that should be her core constituency in the primary—women—believing it would limit her appeal to other portions of the electorate. And she has ignored suggestions that she change course and act with more urgency in this regard, telling me, “I need to be patient, and know that it’s going to take time and hard work. … Your poll numbers are irrelevant today. What matters is where you are a year from now.”

The problem facing Gillibrand is, poll numbers at this stage of a presidential primary have never been more relevant to the outcome—and if she doesn’t do something drastic to improve hers, she won’t be around a year from now.","The Democratic National Committee is limiting the total number of participants to 20.
Whether it’s the booze flowing from the taps or some other environmental factor—OK, it’s the booze—this has been Gillibrand’s best event of the day.
Probably not.”This is the hang-up of Gillibrand’s campaign.

124,The Moneyball Fix for Immigration Policy,Justin Gest,"President Donald Trump wants to overhaul the U.S. immigration system so that it stops favoring visa applicants with U.S. family ties, and instead gives priority to highly skilled applicants and those with job offers. The proposal is based on the assumption that immigrants’ educational credentials—what the administration calls “merit”—will lead to increased U.S. wages and immigrants who better integrate into U.S. culture.

Immediately after it was announced, the proposal drew criticism from all sides. Many Republicans don’t think it goes far enough to combat illegal immigration, while others on the right want total immigrant admissions to be cut. Many Democrats, meanwhile, don’t want to roll back the system’s humanitarian, family-oriented principles that have worked well over decades, and also want to resolve the status of America’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Story Continued Below

The whole idea of “merit” is a lightning rod in a highly charged issue. But there’s a smarter way for both sides to think about who we let in, and why. The Trump administration is on to something when it says we need a new way to evaluate immigrants, one that predicts their future success as Americans. Indeed, considering future immigrants’ contributions is now commonplace in immigration policies around the world. But the Trump administration’s idea of how to do this is too basic. Many Democrats, for their part, are too quick to dismiss any kind of evaluation as anti-humanitarian: Done right, it actually would consider family and other humanitarian factors, and likely set new arrivals up for greater success in their new country.

Call it Immigration Moneyball. Just as baseball was revolutionized with a multidimensional data-driven system for evaluating and selecting players, the U.S. can analyze far more information than it currently does to decide which immigrants will best thrive in American society and contribute to the economy—something people of all political persuasions want to see.

Right now, both sides are viewing immigrants in entirely one-dimensional ways. Imagine a system that instead considered immigrants more fully as individuals—rather than simply as skilled workers, unskilled workers or family members, as our current immigration framework does. It might, for example, find merit in whether applicants made previous visits to the United States as a student, tourist or temporary worker. Imagine a system that also tracked people’s exits from our airports, harbors and train stations, and then assigned value to an immigrant’s previous on-time departures. The system might find “merit” in youth, in fluent multilingualism, in training or work experience in trades that are in special demand at the moment, or in advanced degrees from American universities. It could prioritize immigrants who pledge to settle in rapidly depopulating regions for their first 10 years after arrival; admits could even be matched to locales likely to produce their successful employment and integration.

Imagine if all this was considered alongside whether immigrants have family in the U.S. to receive them, help them adjust and help them find work. That, too, is a predictor of likely success: Research suggests that family migrants with close existing family ties have similar economic outcomes to migrants admitted on labor visas that screen for credentials and contracts. In this light, family represents a powerful form of merit, too. And importantly—because welcoming people in need is a core tenet of American culture—the criteria might include whether admission will rescue them from countries subject to severe poverty, violence or natural disasters.

We now have the tools to discover what qualities and factors actually make immigrants most likely to succeed in the United States—and then assess would-be immigrants based on those criteria. To call the approach “Moneyball” is oversimplifying, of course; immigration, unlike baseball, doesn’t deliver easily countable runs and wins, and an immigrant’s success can and should be defined in many ways. It could mean law abidance, employment, economic mobility, business ownership, patents filed, sense of belonging or political participation.

What qualities matter most will largely be up to the government in power to decide. While we can debate what constitutes successful integration, it would be better if we actually collected and consolidated information about the extent to which admitted immigrants are making progress in these different ways. If we did, we could see which attributes known at admission best predict these different forms of success, and adjust our criteria accordingly in the future. Right now, we don’t know.



***

For decades, baseball was managed according to hunches and instinct. For a sport that collects more statistics than any other, much of its recruiting and game-day decision-making was based on a highly subjective je ne sais quoi.

This all ended when the Oakland Athletics began incorporating evidence-based, analytical reasoning into decision-making, an approach documented in Michael Lewis’ 2003 book, and now adopted to some extent by every Major League team. Early adopters held a major advantage before the rest of the game caught up.

Today, U.S. immigration policy looks a lot like baseball once did. Most people orient their policy preferences around their gut feelings about foreigners. Many on the left view immigrants as either hard workers who will reinforce shrinking populations or vulnerable people who must be welcomed in the spirit of humanitarianism. On the nationalist right, many view immigrants as opportunists or even (as the president himself has suggested) criminals, who come to exploit the resources of rich countries, and whose presence threatens the national culture. The debate has mostly been argued from the extremes (see fearmongering about the gang MS-13, and calls to #AbolishICE) and become unmoored from sober reasoning.

The truth is, as countless studies have shown, immigrants on average are powerful generators of economic growth, who are disproportionately employed, innovative, entrepreneurial and law-abiding—and who, on average, quickly integrate and do not compete with American-born workers for jobs, except at the lowest wages. Immigration advocates have repeated these findings more than a pitcher rehearses his windup.

But the current system is also operating with a clunky, outdated selection strategy. This is where critics have an important point: The system we have really is relatively indiscriminate, and unconcerned with predicting good outcomes.

Like baseball teams, governments and researchers already collect extensive data about admitted and prospective immigrants in every dimension of public debate: employment and welfare consumption; criminality and civic engagement; language attainment and educational achievement. Name it.

But the government doesn’t use or consolidate all this data. It hasn’t crunched the numbers to determine the full range of qualities and factors that help an immigrant succeed and contribute—how much, for example, English-speaking skills upon entry matter for longer-term workforce participation, and whether younger skilled immigrants contribute more tax dollars before retirement than older skilled immigrants with more established expertise.

Furthermore, rather than evaluate the entirety of an admission applicant’s qualifications, the U.S. government—like many others—limits their consideration to a few factors and an arbitrary interview at an embassy. Visa types are designated by the primary “purpose” of entry, as if immigrants are either workers or family members, refugees or students. It reduces each immigrant, a person with unique potential and confluence of skills, attributes and needs, to a single, artificial classification and then files her or him into a line. While particular H1-B visas, for example, might prioritize immigrants who have a specific skill and job, they take no account of humanitarian concerns, or whether that immigrant has family in the U.S.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2299/1155968404_6039946863001_6039940167001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

The result is a system that ignores many indicators of immigrants’ potential. It’s like a university that selects students based on their future major, and little else.

Think about this: Would you rather grant admission to an engineer based on no other information, or to an engineer who speaks fluent English, has a sister in Detroit, and was once a high school exchange student in Omaha? The answer seems obvious.

Perhaps less obvious, would you rather grant admission to a qualified engineer without family ties or demonstrated familiarity with the U.S., or to an agricultural worker who speaks proficient English, has a sister in Detroit and was once a high school exchange student in Omaha?

More difficult, would you rather admit that agricultural worker with family ties and English skills or one with a contract offer already, who has agreed to settle in a rapidly depopulating region, but who doesn’t have family in the United States?

An admissions system informed by statistical reasoning and criteria adjustable to current needs would be able to answer these questions, selecting optimal applicants for temporary or permanent visas based on reliable predictions about the applicants’ productivity and social contributions, as well as the state of the U.S. economy at the time.

Backed by such reasoning, the engineer or agricultural worker doesn’t just look good; we will have evidence-based assurances that she is likely to actually be good.



***

Does all this require an overhaul of the existing admissions system? Yes. In addition to verifying the data we already collect from applicants, we’d need to collect more—and then build the capacity to quickly process admissions decisions. We will also need a system that processes exits as well as entries and studies immigrants’ progress once they are admitted.

Once built, the system can be adjusted according to new legislation, government research or employer recommendations with little lag time. Imagine if there were a shortage of nurses or programmers. Imagine if fertility rates dropped and social security nears insolvency. Imagine if there was a pool of immigrants already with American university credentials who were qualified for open jobs. All of these are known actualities, and a more advanced system would enable quicker adjustments.

Such a new system can also help the country incorporate more visas for circular migration that permits immigrants to regularly or seasonally enter the United States for specific work purposes and then return to their country of origin. If government agencies ever synchronize their data, renewing a visa for these and other temporary immigrants can be more like renewing a driver’s license, subject to a variety of quick checks. This will all reduce the incentive to cross the border without authorization or overstay a visa. Today, employers with low-skilled or seasonal labor needs often rely on undocumented workers, who cannot return to the U.S. if they return to their country of origin and are barred from returning for 10 years thanks to “unlawful presence” rules.

The idea that what we know about immigrants when they apply for admission predicts their ultimate social and economic contributions is one that has informed immigrant admissions in places like Australia and Canada, whose “point-based” systems evaluate applicants based on similar skill-oriented criteria. But even the Canadians—whose points-based system is the world standard—do not include criteria like family guarantors or attempts to match immigrants with certain regions.

As with any immigration policy, there will be political hurdles. Critics on the left will worry that algorithms will replace the current system, which dedicates about two thirds of all visas to family admissions. But algorithms can be weighted or overridden to continue to prioritize spouses and minor children without counting them toward quotas. And they can also be programmed to recognize more extended members of American families, who have been less likely to be admitted over the past couple decades.

Critics on the right might worry that such a meritocratic system will lead to even greater annual flows of immigrants in light of new modes of entry. However, the qualifications for entry can be raised or lowered to hit annual flow targets, and quotas—if desired—can still be applied. It is also worth acknowledging that the foreign-born represent about 15 percent of the American population—about half the share in places like Switzerland (30 percent) and Australia (29 percent), and still lower than New Zealand (23 percent), Canada (22 percent), Austria (19 percent), Sweden (18 percent), Ireland (17 percent) and elsewhere.

Other critics may worry that a system based on algorithms and points may be less transparent than the current one, and may be more subject to bad-faith inputs driven by racism or xenophobia. As I have argued before, a side effect of established points-based systems has been preference for white applicants and others from countries with stronger education systems. Giving credit for previous visits to the U.S. can have the same effect because it is easier to get visas from Western countries. But this would be offset if family ties were substantially taken into consideration. The system could also assign “merit” to people who hail from countries underrepresented in the United States—among the purposes of the diversity visa lottery that the Trump administration has proposed cutting. Furthermore, the current system is hardly transparent anyway. Consular officers and immigration judges possess enormous arbitrary power, and there are reports of line-cutting.

Ideally, a system like this should appeal to many on both sides. It will render a sense of control to those on the right, and justify maintaining current a steady flow of newcomers as the left envisions.

As in baseball, there will be plenty of exceptions, when advanced reasoning still fails to predict good outcomes. Not every immigrant will create as many jobs as Elon Musk; some will commit crimes (likely at lower rates than American citizens, according to U.S. government data). And as in baseball, there will be holdouts who don’t want to modernize the immigration system and maintain current flows, whether because of persistent prejudice or deep-seated mistrust. But as in baseball, such small-mindedness will ultimately lose.

Trump has gotten away with strategies as simplistic as a steel wall and tactics as barbaric as separating children from their parents because the debate has become symbolic and subject to our most basic instincts, which are currently calling for humanity or control.

The best way to simultaneously humanize immigrants and control their admission is to shift to a system that considers their humanity in the most complete way possible.","Imagine a system that instead considered immigrants more fully as individuals—rather than simply as skilled workers, unskilled workers or family members, as our current immigration framework does.

125,Why Justin Amash’s Anti-Trump Solo Act Is Doomed,Jeff Greenfield,"Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo analysis Why Justin Amash’s Anti-Trump Solo Act Is Doomed In Hollywood, the lonely truthteller makes history. In Washington, history shows that their friends send them packing.

Jeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.

The nation’s Democrats and dwindling legions of never-Trump conservatives have thrilled to the one-man rebellion of Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan libertarian whose thoughtful, damning tweetstorm on impeachment made him the only Republican to break ranks on the most divisive issue in American politics.

As this one crack appeared in the dam, President Donald Trump’s critics waited for more. Everyone knows the script once the first brave voice speaks out: the lone holdout on a jury, convincing his colleagues that the defendant may not be guilty after all. The union organizer at the factory, rallying her coworkers against greater wrongs. The whistleblower standing alone on the Senate floor, railing until truth prevails and the corrupt are exposed.

Story Continued Below

The problem is that the script comes from movies. That was Henry Fonda in the jury room, not a real foreman; that was Sally Field as Norma Rae organizing the cotton mill; and Jimmy Stewart delivering his lines on a studio version of the Senate floor.

When it comes to real politics, the record is grim. History may reward your courage, but the politics of the moment suggests that the heretics end up leading a one-man band into political obscurity.

In 1964, when the Senate handed a blank check to President Lyndon Johnson “to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, in Vietnam”—which LBJ used as the legal basis for the massive escalation in years to come— 98 senators voted for it. Only two senators, Democrats Wayne Morse of Oregon and Ernest Gruening of Alaska, voted “no” on the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. As the war escalated, and it became clear the engagement was a national catastrophe, history vindicated their position and other senators, like Arkansas’ William Fulbright and Wisconsin’s Gaylord Nelson, wished they had done the same. But it didn’t do much good for Morse and Gruening. Both were defeated for reelection in 1968, and neither held political office again.

Eight years later, even before a band of burglars tried to break into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate, two Republican House members challenged President Richard Nixon in the Republican primary. For California’s Pete McCloskey, the issue was Nixon’s failure to end the war in Vietnam. For Ohio’s John Ashbrook, it was Nixon’s various apostasies from conservative orthodoxy—the turn toward China, arms deals with Moscow, wage and price controls. Not only did Ashbrook and McCloskey lose, but barely anyone remembers Nixon had challengers. Ashbrook withdrew, and McCloskey wound up with one delegate out of 1,348.

Even prominent party leaders run aground when calling for resistance to a president. Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic nominee, turned hard against FDR’s New Deal, ultimately campaigning for Republican nominee Alf Landon in 1936, who lost in a 46-state landslide. In 1940, Roosevelt’s vice president, John Nance Garner, sought the nomination for himself, opposing both FDR’s unprecedented third term and his New Deal policies. Garner got 61 delegates out of 1,093 and retired from public life.

For sheer persistence on the “lonely voice” front, no one can top Jeannette Rankin, who was elected as the first female member of the House of Representatives in 1916. A year later, she was one of 50 House members to vote against the American entry into World War I, and she left the House after one term. Twenty-two years later, in 1940, she went back to the House; and a year later, she became the only member of either house to vote against the declaration of war with Japan. Once again, her first term was her last. (And in this case, history doesn’t smile so kindly on her positions).

Politics is a numbers game, and the record shows that there’s a much safer route for dissidents to survive politically: be part of a decent-sized cohort. By 1968, for example, antiwar Democrats in the Senate—George McGovern, Frank Church, Gaylord Nelson, among others—all won reelection, in part because by then, support for the war in Vietnam had eroded. A more striking example comes from Ronald Reagan’s near-successful campaign in 1976 to depose President Gerald Ford. Despite the conviction of Ford and others that the Reagan primary challenge cost Ford the White House, Reagan faced no hostility from the party base when he ran again in 1980—in large measure because he was much more in sync with the GOP base than Ford was. And while Ted Kennedy did not succeed in unseating President Jimmy Carter in 1980, both his stature in the Senate and the widespread discontent with Carter inside the party left Kennedy as a major voice in American politics for another quarter century.

It’s theoretically possible that some new revelation, or a sudden downturn in the economy, will make Trump vulnerable enough that his party’s House and Senate candidates will find it a political asset to distance themselves from the top of the ticket. But given the willingness of Republicans to defend, and even embrace, the character and conduct of this president, it should not be a surprise to Amash that he finds himself in a party of one. Right now, a primary challenge from ex-Governor William Weld, and a potential campaign by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, look to suffer a similar fate.

Trump’s approval ratings inside his party are now at 90 percent. Those officeholders who have called out the president have found their political careers derailed, one by one: Mark Sanford in South Carolina, Jeff Flake in Arizona, Bob Corker in Tennessee. Trump’s political supporters have purged party officials in several states for suspect loyalty. And the chair of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel, no longer goes by the name “Ronna Romney McDaniel” because the president asked her to drop the name of one of his occasional critics.

For all the idealism of Twelve Angry Men and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, there is a different Hollywood example that Amash should pay attention to: High Noon, the 1952 Western. When Marshall Will Kane asks the people of Hadleyville to help him face down the vicious Miller Gang, the citizens respond by cowering inside their homes. Kane, for all his bravery, is left to stand alone.

It’s no mystery why in today’s Republican Party, so many of those who share Amash’s view of Trump are behaving like the citizens of Hadleyville. “One man with courage makes a majority,” an old adage goes, but when it comes to political heretics, that’s not the way to bet.

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — In a small town tucked in the hills outside Tegucigalpa, there is a stuffed gray bunny rabbit that knows a little girl’s secrets. “I tell him all my things,” she says. “About how I’m doing, and when I feel sad.” She feels sad a lot lately. “I start thinking about things that I shouldn’t be thinking,” she says.

There are a lot of things she shouldn’t be thinking. She is 12 years old and just weeks away from giving birth to a baby.

Story Continued Below

Sofia and her mom told me her story when we met at a women’s shelter in mid-April. Sofia (like others interviewed for this story, she asked me not to use her real name) was raped by a family member of her mom’s boyfriend. She still doesn’t totally understand what pregnancy means or what childbirth entails, but she knows the delivery is looming, and that scares her. “At first, she said that she did not want to have the baby,” Sofia’s mom told me. “She said that she wanted to commit suicide.” When doctors told Sofia she was pregnant and explained that pregnancy meant she was going to have a baby, Sofia, in her soft, small voice, asked whether she could have a doll instead.

When Sofia’s mom found out about the rape, she reported it to the police, and now the man who did it is in jail. But his family kept threatening them, and Sofia and her mom have good reason to worry about what happens once he’s out. Most crimes like this—more than 90 percent—aren’t even prosecuted in Honduras. The few women who do see their attackers go to jail are offered little protection when those sentences end. “If he comes out,” Sofia’s mom says, “I am afraid for my life and her life, too.”

What do you do when you fear for your life and the state won’t protect you? Or if the state might make your already tenuous situation worse? The fraught calculations that face Sofia and her mom are endemic across Honduras, a country that remains in the grip of a rash of violence against women and girls. For some, the answer is simple and disruptive: They have to leave. When exhausted families, mothers toting babies and young women traveling alone arrive at the southern border of the United States, it’s not just gang violence or criminality in general that they’re fleeing. It’s also what Sofia whispers about to her bunny: men who beat, assault, rape and sometimes kill women and girls; law enforcement that does little to curtail them; and laws that deny many women who do survive the chance to retake control and steer their own lives.

As of 2015, Honduras ranked among a tiny group of nations, including war-racked Syria and Afghanistan, with the highest rates of violent deaths of women. Although Honduras’ overall murder rate has decreased in recent years, it remains one of the deadliest countries in the world, and the murder rate has been declining more slowly for female victims. Murder remains the second-leading cause of death for women of childbearing age.

Honduras’ troubling numbers are representative of stark challenges in Central America’s Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Central American migrants are now the majority of those apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, and most come from these three countries. The level of violence in Honduras has gotten attention, but the deeper cultural factors at work are less often plumbed. After two weeks of interviews with more than two dozen women in five Honduran cities and their far outskirts, a portrait emerges of a country where day-to-day violence and misogyny collide with restrictive policies to narrow women’s options to a vanishingly small window of possibility—driving them, sometimes, to flee.

A decade ago most border-crossers might have been single men looking for work. Now the majority are families. According to one analysis from the University of Washington, before 2011, just a third of migrants from Northern Triangle countries said they were fleeing violence; from 2011 to 2016, it was more than 70 percent. Among female migrants, more than half listed violence as their reason for trying to get to the United States. Honduran migrants are more likely than even those from El Salvador and Guatemala to say they’re running away from danger—and from the danger of domestic violence.

Hostile rhetoric and harsher policies have been cornerstones of President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda. But even arrests, deportations and family separations can pale compared with the costs of staying put for many Honduran women. Both local women and advocates here described rape and the threat of rape as methods of terrorizing neighborhoods and controlling women in their own homes. One in 10 Honduran women says her partner abused her physically or sexually at least once in the previous year. (No comparable statistics are available for the United States, but in Canada, the proportion is 1 in 100.) Still, these statistics can be unreliable because family violence and sexual assault often go unreported, and it’s not hard to see why: In 2016, of the more than 400 homicide cases with female victims in Honduras, only 15 were even investigated, resulting in just two convictions.

The Honduran government, with backing from the Catholic and Evangelical churches, exacerbates this crisis by limiting women’s options after sexual violence. Honduras is the only nation in Latin America that bans emergency contraception outright, including for rape victims. Abortion is also outlawed, with no exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal abnormality or the life of the pregnant woman. Women who seek abortions anyway assume physical risk and the potential of years in prison. Women who go through with unwanted pregnancies face a maternal mortality rate that is one of the highest in Latin America; a woman dies nearly every day and a half from pregnancy or childbirth here.

All of this has left Sofia with few options. Sofia’s mom had to quit her job when they decided to move, which means there’s not much money for a new child. A local women’s shelter is helping with counseling and paying for her medical bills and transportation, but it’s not much. Sofia’s mother says her daughter asked for an abortion, but given the law and what Sofia’s mom heard at church, that wasn’t a possibility. And so, Sofia, her fully pregnant belly protruding in jarring juxtaposition to her diminutive preteen frame, is no longer able to go to school, and waits in her one-room home for her delivery date, confiding in her stuffed bunny.

The plan for now is for Sofia’s mom to raise the baby as her own, and tell the girl that she and Sofia are sisters. Hiding up in the hills with a new baby on the way, Sofia’s mom says that leaving Honduras anytime soon is not on the table. But many women in similar positions make the calculus that the short-term risk of migrating is better than the longer-term risk of staying. “Women have to be creative,” says Joaquin Mejía Rivera, a lawyer and human rights investigator in the city of El Progreso, about an hour outside San Pedro Sula.

Vanessa Siliezar, a women’s rights lawyer based in the coastal city of La Ceiba, put it starkly: “If they’re killing you here, it’s better to go die in the desert.”

Mercedez is making that calculation now. She’s a curly-haired 19-year-old, almost feline in her skittishness—when two men’s silhouettes pass by a window, she visibly flinches. She gave birth to a baby girl so recently that when she curls into herself, she still cradles her soft, expanded belly. Mercedez (also a pseudonym) grew up in and around Tegucigalpa in a series of state-run homes for children whose parents died or could no longer care for them, moving from shelter to shelter until she was 18 and found herself abruptly on her own.

When she was volunteering at a nursery, she told me, she began dating one of the security guards, a 22-year-old she eventually learned was a drug dealer and a gang member. As retribution for who knows what, one night he tied her up, gagged her, and he and his friends tortured her in a small house in a dodgy neighborhood. Later that night, the house’s cleaning lady left the door ajar, and Mercedez made her escape. She ran to the police station and begged for a ride to the bus depot; the officer who promised to drive her, she says, took her on his personal motorcycle to an empty plot of land instead, where he raped her. She says he drove her back to the main road, threw 200 lempiras (about $8) at her and took off. It took her hours to get back home to Tegucigalpa. On the way, a drunk man tried to kiss her, and then followed her when she got off the bus. When she crossed the street to sit and wait for her transfer, another group of men started heckling her, asking her the price for sex.

Mercedez says she cried when she read the positive pregnancy test. “What was I going to do with a baby?” she says. “I didn’t have any experience.” She would have taken emergency contraception immediately after the rape, she said, but didn’t know how to get it. She wanted to have an abortion, but knew it was illegal and didn’t pursue one. She initially tried her own way. “At first I didn’t eat, and I didn’t take medicine, because I didn’t want her,” Mercedez says. “I still think the same way I did before. I’m not ready. I don’t know how to do this. ... I don’t have a way to support her.” Still, she wants the best for her baby, and as a result, has considered leaving the country—but she’s an orphaned teenage mom, and so she’s not sure how to do that, either.

The reasons people migrate are complex. For Honduran women, economic instability and physical insecurity are intertwined, and both are exacerbated by the patriarchal norms of society here and women’s lack of political power. Only about half of Honduran women work outside the home. When women do work, they make about half what their male colleagues do. Since men can and do “leave whenever they want,” Siliezar says, women might be left “with three or four children without the possibility of supporting themselves.”

For women who are lucky, a new boyfriend can bring love, affection and support; for women who aren’t, he can be a new source of power and control over the family’s finances and physical safety. Some of the worst scenarios, Siliezar says, are also troublingly common: abusive men who control women and violate their daughters.

“When [a girl] finally gets pregnant at 10 or 11, because it’s the first time she gets her period, she has lost all faith in the future,” she says. “When she goes to ask for help or to the hospital, the law says she has to go with her mom. And that mom is the one who has been quiet about what this girl has gone through her entire life.” There is then a rush to blame the mother—a woman who, Siliezar says, often has her own story to tell.

Four hours by car from Siliezar’s office in La Ceiba and just outside of the big city of San Pedro Sula is Choloma, which just may be the most dangerous city in one of the world’s most dangerous nations.

Here, in a small house where chickens roam the yard, lives Ricsy (not her real name), at 19 the youngest of her mother’s six children, and one of four still alive. She’s not sure how old she was when her big sister, who was beautiful and tall and had long hair, was found dead among the sugar cane, but Ricsy thinks she was about 4-feet tall when she saw her sister’s body, pants pulled down, on TV. She’s also not sure how old she was when her stepfather began raping her. “I remember he got there when I was 5, and then I turned 8, I turned 9, 10, 11, 13. I was 13, and then I had the baby,” she says.

She told her mom about the abuse, and said she would commit suicide if it continued, but her mom didn’t believe her. It was only after Ricsy became pregnant with her son that her mother took her claims seriously, yet the stepfather stayed in the house for two more years. He would beat up her mother, too. Ricsy isn’t sure what he did for work, but she knows he used drugs, and “when he didn’t have any money for his vices, then he would go out and hurt people.”

Abortion wasn’t an option. Legally it was off the table, and Ricsy grew up hearing it was wrong. “I went to church, and the pastor had said if we had an abortion, it’s like we are killing someone,” Ricsy says.

When Ricsy was 15, her stepfather was murdered. That brought relief, but not resolution. When she looks at her now 6-year-old son, Ricsy says, “I just remember everything that I have gone through.”

“Ricsy,” a 19-year-old survivor of childhood sexual abuse, was impregnated at age 13 after being raped by her stepfather. Unable to obtain an abortion, she gave birth to a son, who is now 6. “I just look at him and I just remember everything that I have gone through,” Ricsy says. | Nichole Sobecki/VII

A few months ago, Ricsy told me, she was raped by a stranger on her way from work at a shopping mall just a few blocks from her home, grabbed as she passed her son’s elementary school. Her boy keeps asking why she doesn’t walk him to school as much as she used to, and why she cries when they pass the building. She doesn’t have an answer. She goes to church for solace, and the pastor knows something is wrong. He is the only person, Ricsy says, “who asked me why I am not the same happy person I used to be.” She tells him she’s just busy because, she says, “I feel ashamed.” Besides, she can guess what he’ll say: “‘Let’s pray for that person so God may put his hand on him,’” Ricsy says. She isn’t sure she has it in her to pray for the man who raped her.

For now, she gets through the days with her son and her 3-year-old daughter. On the days she feels strong enough to take her son to school, “We hold hands, and we sing worship songs,” she says. On one of their walks, “He asked me, ‘Did you pray today?’ And I said yes. And I asked him, ‘Did you pray today?’ And he said yes. He said, ‘I prayed for all the sadness to leave your heart.’”

Ricsy isn’t sure that she will ever escape this sadness, so deep that she sometimes finds herself curled in a ball underneath her son’s bed. But she may escape Honduras. In her 19 years, Ricsy hasn’t been safe at home, and she hasn’t been safe on the street; she can’t walk through the market without a sense of hypervigilance, like someone is following her. Ricsy, who had asthma, was a sick kid, which meant she was forced to drop out of school at 7, and now as an adult she cannot read or write. She’s poor, and so leaving for the United States would mean walking, and that brings its own perils. But she’s seen the caravans and is increasingly thinking about joining one, imagining how good it would feel to send some money back for her kids, to be able to say “yes” when her son asks for a new schoolbook or soccer cleats. Whatever hazards lurk along the way feel less daunting than life in Choloma. “My mom said the journey was very dangerous,” Ricsy says. “And I told her, ‘I know, Mom, but I can no longer continue to live here.’”

A great number of Honduran girls have been, like Sofia and Ricsy, raped and impregnated as children. More than 20,000 Honduran girls age 18 and under gave birth in the country’s national hospitals in 2017, according to Centro de Derechos de Mujeres, a women’s rights group, giving Honduras the second-highest adolescent birth rate in Latin America. Of these 20,000 girls, 819 of them were 14 or younger. Twenty-five were just 10. Under the Honduran penal code, all sex with girls under the age of 14 is rape; a 2014 study found that nearly 80 percent of Honduran adolescent girls in relationships were physically, psychologically or sexually abused by their partners.

Telling women and girls that they cannot prevent pregnancies with emergency contraception, then barring their access to safe abortion, can compound the trauma of rape, says Amber Assaf, a psychologist with Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) in Choloma. Assaf sees sexual violence survivors in her practice regularly, and says that women who have been sexually violated need to return to feeling like they’re in control of their bodies in order to heal. Women and girls who are raped and then refused the choice to prevent or end pregnancies feel “that they have lack of control of their own lives,” Assaf says. “They end up feeling that that is normal, as they do with the other kinds of violence they suffer.”

Siliezar observes that control over women’s reproductive lives extends from the state to the household. Many men in Honduras, she says, “cannot tolerate that a woman is not going to have a baby.” Siliezar works with victims of violence, and often hears that men fly into a rage if they find out their female partners are using contraception. Sometimes, the women are beaten. One woman Siliezar met tried to take a break from more than a decade of childbearing by using birth control pills. When her husband found them, Siliezar says, he forced her—his wife and a mother of six—to drink the pills with toilet water.

The United Nations and other human rights groups called on Honduras to change its abortion law in 2017 to allow the procedure in the cases of rape and incest, or where the pregnancy posed a threat to the pregnant woman’s life or health. But the Catholic and Evangelical churches rallied against even a minor liberalization of the abortion law, lobbying legislators and bringing their political influence to bear. In the end, the religious groups won—abortion stayed illegal and criminal.

Recently, the government did update the nation’s penal code: Later this year, Honduras is expected to decrease the penalty for violence against women, to between one and four years in jail, according to local news reports. The Honduran government has spent decades making it difficult for women to assert control over their own bodies, even after they survive violence. Now, that same government is poised to make it easier for perpetrators of violence to walk free.



***

If you’re a woman in Honduras who wants to leave all of this for America, there are two ways to do it: You can go through formal means and wait, perhaps for decades, to see whether someone says “come in,” or you can try to cross the border without documentation.

For Honduran women who are victims of violence and are seeking asylum, both these routes are highly uncertain. Asylum protections have long extended to those who flee their countries because of a well-founded fear of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group; domestic violence survivors have been found to be a particular social group, and have been granted asylum on that basis. A year ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to make it harder for victims of domestic and gang violence to get asylum; while he succeeded in giving judges less leeway and making these claims more time-consuming to obtain, women who survive domestic violence can still apply for asylum in the United States.

But even if a Honduran woman meets the requirements of asylum, there is no “asylum-seeker” visa she can apply for from Honduras to enter the United States; she must have left her country first before applying. This is one reason so many people from the Northern Triangle are caravaning to Mexico and trying to get across the U.S. border. From 2012 to 2017, the number of asylum applications filed by citizens of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in the United States rose nearly 800 percent, from just over 3,500 in 2012 to more than 31,000 in 2017. According to researchers at Syracuse University, the percentage of asylum applications denied by U.S. immigration courts has been on the rise since 2012—hitting 65 percent in 2018. That year, immigration judges granted only 21 percent of asylum cases from Hondurans.

Facing these obstacles, some women, like Heydi Garcia Giron, 34, wait. Heydi has never left her hometown of Tegucigalpa, let alone Honduras, but she knows she needs to go. The scar across her shoulder, extending across her neck, is a daily reminder. Heydi has what you might call “presence” if she were a politician or an actress; she draws your gaze, holds your attention. When she says, “I am a warrior,” you believe her.

Heydi was orphaned at 6 when her mother died during pregnancy, and her father, a drug dealer, was in jail. Before that, when she was an even younger girl, Heydi was raped by her father’s best friend, she told me. After that, when she was in boarding school, she was sexually abused by her own best friend’s father. Heydi had a son with a man she spent nine years with, and then a daughter with a man she was with for another nine years. She almost had another baby, but her daughter’s father beat her so badly during the pregnancy that she miscarried. He’s the man who finally tried to kill her, attacking her with a machete last fall. He cut the nerves in her arm, and so she still struggles to use it. He nearly severed her jugular.

It happened on the day after her birthday, and he was angry she had met up with a friend. “Do you think that you own yourself?” Heydi says he yelled at her before he grabbed the machete. “I am going to show you how to respect men.” As he brought the machete down on Heydi’s neck, their 5-year-old daughter threw herself at his feet, begging him to stop. He paused to comfort her and pet her head, telling her it was over. That’s when Heydi, one hand holding her throat closed, dragged herself away and ran. At the hospital, Heydi says a doctor told her, “If you believe in God, start praying, because I do not think you are going to make it.” She thought about her children, and “at that moment, my world just fell.”

But Heydi did make it. When she woke up in a hospital room, a doctor asked her some basic questions to check her consciousness, and then told her not to talk so her throat could heal. “I just told him, ‘God gives his hardest battles to the toughest soldiers,’” Heydi recalls.

By the time the anesthesia wore off, “everything hurt, even my hair hurt,” she says. Her heart hurt, too. Her daughter was having nightmares, waking up screaming, “Dad, don’t kill my mom.” A mysterious woman showed up in Heydi’s hospital room, and said she was sent by Heydi’s now-ex to check up on her. “I was scared,” Heydi said. “If he could send someone to the hospital to see how I was doing, he could send someone else to kill me.” She filed a police report, and the case against her husband is moving forward. But there’s no guaranteeing the outcome or his sentence—or that members of his family or friend network won’t make Heydi pay.

And so Heydi, like others, wants to seek asylum in the United States.

“We are seeing a mass migration from Honduras from women who are fleeing everything from domestic violence to violence by gang members, and often there’s overlap between the two,” says Lori Adams, director at the Immigration Intervention Project at Sanctuary for Families, a U.S. organization that works with victims of gender-based violence, including on asylum claims. “Women are leaving with no other option but to flee north, even knowing that the journey itself might be life-threatening, but knowing it’s a near certainty that they will be killed if they remain.”

Heydi gathered all the evidence and paperwork, but she says when she went to the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa, officials referred her to a U.S. government call center, which just referred her to a website. A friend at the embassy also told her to try the Mexican Embassy and request asylum there. But Mexico, she says, is just as dangerous. If she could stay in Honduras, she would. But “violence here in Honduras is unbearable,” she says. “It is my country. I love it and it hurts, but it is the truth.” (The U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa did not respond to a request for comment.)

Heydi has heard about the caravans and those who walk or take boats across the border, but she has also heard it’s dangerous and isn’t willing to put her children through that risk. And so, she waits. “My life was gray,” Heydi says. “I don’t want my children’s lives to be gray. I want to break that chain and see the light.”

On April 10, 2019, after news of a new migrant caravan spread, almost 1,000 people gathered at the bus terminal in San Pedro Sula to join the group. | Nichole Sobecki/VII

In mid-April, I watched a group of a migrants depart from the San Pedro Sula bus station just as the dawn light broke through the gray morning. Those with money for a bus ticket had left the night before, extending fistfuls of cash for a place on one of several overcrowded coaches that would take them to the border. Those who couldn’t pay arrived at the station in a steady stream, gathering through the night as they waited for an appointed leader to say it was time to go. Napping men pulled their baseball caps down over their eyes. Women fed babies in a state of half-sleep, while family members lolled in the nearby grass, counting down the minutes until they had to wish their loved ones farewell. When the caravan of several hundred Hondurans from across the country set out on foot, young mothers walked with hips jutting sideways from the weight of sleep-heavy children. Women took hold of tiny hands when it was time for the group to cross the highway. Some pushed baby carriages draped with blankets.

Three months earlier, Marlin, 32, had been one of those women. She was also seeking a new home in the United States, but she did what Heydi wouldn’t: She took her children and her partner, and they walked with the caravan that left San Pedro Sula on January 15. The choice, Marlin says, was made for her when her 9-year-old daughter was raped. She only found out when a doctor’s exam for an unrelated health issue discovered a perianal wart, a sexually transmitted infection that the girl would need removed. The rapist was Marlin’s mother’s boyfriend, she said.

Marlin and her family stayed for the criminal trial, even while her own mother turned on her. “She says I’m a bitch and that my daughter is a prostitute,” Marlin says. “My mom said she was going to give my address to his siblings so they can go after me and kill me.” He was sentenced to 11 years in prison, but there’s no assurance he will serve the whole term. And his family continues to threaten Marlin, saying “that I was going to pay for what I had done to their brother,” as she puts it. She especially worries because she knows they own guns.

“Shortly after he pled guilty, I heard about the caravans. I couldn’t take it anymore,” Marlin says. “It was pain after pain, it was tears after tears, and I could no longer bear having that life.”

They walked for days through the rain and the cold; sometimes they hitchhiked. Border guards in Mexico tear-gassed them, leaving the children sobbing. “They cried and just kept calling, ‘Mom, Mom,’ and I just asked for forgiveness and also asked God for forgiveness for putting them through this ordeal,” Marlin says. In Mexico, they got bare-bones legal advice from volunteer lawyers; they were also put in jail for a night before making their way farther north. “I never felt safe,” Marlin says.

Marlin is currently in Mexico with her children, all their names on a waitlist for asylum in the United States. It’s hard to fill the days when you’re waiting for your life to begin, but it could be worse. Her daughter smiles again now. If they can just make it over that border, maybe her daughter will be safe; maybe she’ll have opportunities. Maybe her son will see there are different ways for men to be. Maybe, Marlin says, they will have the choice to become whoever they want.","Story Continued BelowSofia and her mom told me her story when we met at a women’s shelter in mid-April.

On September 25, 1984, three officials from the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco departed for San Francisco Airport to meet with their counterparts from Seattle and exchange confidential “pouched” diplomatic materials.

This exchange happened every other Tuesday, and each time, the Soviets were tailed by a van full of San Francisco-based FBI counterintelligence officials. Although the FBI knew the Soviets were aware of this surveillance, the Bureau didn’t try to conceal it either, according to the Los Angeles Times, which recounted this event from later court testimony.

Story Continued Below

But this Tuesday in 1984 was different. Normally, there were only two Soviet officials meeting the Seattle diplomats at the airport, not three. And in addition to the usual FBI surveillance team, the Bureau had assigned 20 more agents to track the movement of the third man, Aleksander Grishin, an accredited diplomat—and a Soviet intelligence officer.

When the Soviet officials entered the airport, with FBI agents watching, Grishin detached himself to make a call at a pay phone. Hundreds of miles down the coast, FBI counterintelligence agents working out of a makeshift base of operations in a Los Angeles motel listened as Svetlana Ogorodnikov, a 34-year-old Soviet émigré who had been on the FBI’s radar, picked up the phone in her Hollywood apartment. It was Grishin. Speaking in coded Russian, he asked if she had made arrangements with an “acquaintance” to fly to Europe that October. Ogorodnikov confirmed she had.

This was no ordinary FBI surveillance operation: The “acquaintance” Grishin referred to was himself an FBI agent—a man who, out of greed, desperation, and spite, had begun an affair with Ogorodnikov and agreed to sell classified information to the Soviet government. Eventually, this man—Richard W. Miller, a 47-year-old Los Angeles-based counterintelligence agent on the Bureau’s Soviet squad—would become the first FBI agent ever convicted of espionage.

And the man who would finally secure Miller’s conviction in 1990—after three trials over the course of six years—was a young U.S. attorney in Los Angeles: Adam Schiff.

Today, Schiff is more familiar as the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and one of the country’s most vocal critics of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia-connected figures during the 2016 presidential race—entanglements Schiff called, in a phone interview, “deeply unethical” and in some cases “fundamentally compromising.” To some observers, Schiff’s vehemence—he frequently appears on TV, and often gets attacked by President Donald Trump on Twitter—seems politically opportunistic, or misplaced. But his toughness on Russia and his wariness of Moscow’s intelligence apparatus far predate Trump. In key ways, Schiff’s perspective on Russia was shaped decades earlier, during his prosecution of Richard Miller.

“I learned a lot about Russian tradecraft: how the Russians operate, who they target, the vulnerabilities they look for,” Schiff recalls. “They want people with access to information that is of use to them. They look for people who are sort of at the margins at what they do, that have financial problems, who have marital problems that they can exploit. And they found a very good target with Richard Miller.”

During his work on the case, Schiff was also in frequent contact with FBI agents investigating Miller—giving the future congressman an intimate look at, and respect for, the Bureau’s counterintelligence mission.

Since the release last month of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump and Russia, Schiff has made an increasingly assertive push for the counterintelligence information the FBI and Mueller’s team gathered about Trump-Russia, which was largely excluded from the redacted Mueller report. In a May 8 subpoena to Attorney General Bill Barr, Schiff demanded “all documents and materials, regardless of form or classification,” relating to the counterintelligence or foreign intelligence side of the investigation. (On May 21, Schiff and the Justice Department reached a tentative deal for Schiff’s committee to access these materials.) Schiff has also asked for a briefing by Justice Department officials on the FBI’s counterintelligence probe into Trump-Russia, which began before Mueller’s probe but whose current status is unclear.

Schiff accepts that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Trump associates and the Russian government (though he has said there is “plenty of evidence of collusion.”) For the congressman, the Trump-Russia affair goes beyond the domain of the potentially prosecutable, and broaches the broader question of compromise—whether, say, one’s financial or personal entanglements can create improper levers of influence for a hostile foreign state. In the counterintelligence world, behavior need not be criminal to represent a threat to the country’s national security interests.

Schiff, unusually for someone in Congress, first learned this lesson decades ago. To fully understand why he has continued to ring the alarm on Trump-Russia, we need to travel back to Los Angeles in 1984, and the strange, sordid saga of Richard Miller.



***

Almost everyone who interacted with him professionally seemed to agree: Miller should never have become an FBI agent.

According to contemporaneous reporting and recent interviews with former FBI officials, Miller was slovenly and overweight, which earned him sanctions from his FBI superiors, designed to induce him into getting into shape. He was chastised by his bosses for selling Amway products out of the trunk of his car. He was known to pilfer comic books and candy bars from 7-Eleven, and consume them with abandon. At one point, he admitted to skimming from payments he was supposed to give to Bureau informants, and to selling FBI data to a local private investigator.

Miller’s home life was complicated. He lived alone during the workweek in a rundown house in Los Angeles and commuted back on the weekend to San Diego County, where his wife and eight children lived near a small avocado ranch that he tended. With Miller’s modest government salary, money was tight. His marriage was also suffering: In 1983, Miller, a practicing Mormon, was excommunicated from the church over an ongoing affair.

John Libby, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Schiff on the 1990 conviction, called Miller “a complete mess.” He was a “goofball” and an “idiot,” says a former FBI counterintelligence agent who worked the Miller case. Another former FBI agent who was involved in the investigation described Miller to me, variously, as a “moron,” a “misfit,” a “putz” whose “clothes looked like he slept in them,” and an all-around “terrible person.”

Miller “was a case of the FBI carrying its wounded too far,” recalls this person. “He screwed up everything he did.”

Miller came to the Soviet squad with no background in Russian language or culture, and no prior experience in counterintelligence. Many of the Bureau’s senior-most officials in Los Angeles, however, were important figures in the local Mormon community; re-assigning Miller to the Soviet squad was, ironically, part of an effort to keep an eye on him—to bring him back “into the FBI fold, and the Mormon fold,” Libby recalls.

It didn’t work. Miller once again failed to distinguish himself. Then, in May 1984, he met Svetlana Ogorodonikov.

Ogorodonikov was considered an outré and not entirely trustworthy figure in the local Soviet émigré community, which was largely populated by “refuseniks”—Jews who had fought for exit visas, and who were stripped of their Soviet citizenship upon leaving the country and banned from returning. According to Sleeping With The FBI, a 1993 book about the Miller case by Russell Warren Howe, Ogorodonikov’s husband, Nikolay, was Jewish, and the family used an exemption allowing Jews to leave the Soviet Union permanently to re-settle in Los Angeles.

Svetlana trained to become a medical technician; Nikolay worked in a sausage factory. But for the Ogorodnikovs, Los Angeles was strange and desiccated. The marriage soured. They were poor. They fought. They drank, especially Svetlana. Homesick, she decided she wanted to visit her family back in Russia, and to send the couple’s son to a Crimean summer camp favored by the children of Soviet apparatchiks. Both required special dispensation from Soviet officials, so, according to reports in the L.A. Times and conversations with former FBI officials, she started serving as a sort of social host and fixer to Soviet diplomats traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles—and to intelligence officers working undercover as diplomats, like Aleksander Grishin.

By the early 1980s, Ogorodnikov was running a Soviet film series that catered to local Russian speakers in Los Angeles. This part-time job not only helped her keep tabs on the community but allowed her to travel occasionally to the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco—the USSR’s West Coast spy base—where she picked up the films. Ogorodnikov served as a sort of clearinghouse for information about members of the Soviet émigré community in Los Angeles, which she passed on to her to consular contacts. According to the L.A. Times, she was once dispatched by Soviet consular personnel in San Francisco to help quash a mutiny of Soviet sailors at the Port of Los Angeles and even briefly initiated a search for a Soviet defector who was believed to live in Southern California.

By 1980, Ogorodikov’s frequent trips to the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco had piqued the interest of the FBI’s Los Angeles office. In 1982, she was approached by the Bureau, meeting regularly with FBI counterintelligence agent John Hunt, but he ended their relationship early the next year, claiming it wasn’t resulting in any valuable information. There were also questions about where her ultimate loyalties lay. And there might have been another factor at play: Ogorodonikov would later claim that she and Hunt were sleeping together, and Hunt would retire quietly around the time of Miller’s arrest in 1984. (Hunt denied the affair.)

Ogorodnikov wasn’t a trained spy, but U.S. officials believed her work showed she was acting as a Soviet intelligence asset. (“The Svetlana equivalent [today] is Maria Butina,” says Libby, referring to the U.S.-based Russian gun-rights activist, who in April was sentenced to 18 months in prison for being an unregistered Russian agent. “It’s literally the same MO.”)

In the spring of 1984, Ogorodnikov again reached out to Hunt at the main FBI office in Los Angeles, perhaps in an attempt to rekindle their relationship. Hunt continued to avoid her. But Miller, it appears, got wind of her calls and made contact. The two started meeting regularly; part of Miller’s job was to develop sources in the local Russian-speaking community. Things quickly moved from the professional to the personal.

According to reports in the L.A. Times, their first rendezvous, in May 1984, was at a beach in Malibu. They met again, soon afterward, at a park in Westwood—and this time had sex, in Miller’s car, which was parked next to a Little League baseball field. Miller and Ogorodnikov continued to sleep together thereafter, often at Miller’s home away from his wife and children.

In August 1984, Ogorodnikov made her pitch, telling Miller that she worked for the Soviet government, and that it would pay him for classified FBI documents he could provide, given his position on the Soviet counterintelligence squad. Miller asked for $50,000 in gold and $15,000 in cash, put in three separate safety-deposit boxes in different banks as payment, according to the L.A. Times.

The Soviets wanted proof that Miller could deliver. So later that month, Miller and Ogorodnikov drove north, to San Francisco, where her contacts at the consulate were based. It was a wild ride up. Ogorodnikov brought a container of cognac and margarita mix, taking slugs on the drive, and plied Miller—who never drank—with the cocktail. By the time they arrived in the Bay Area, both Ogorodnikov and Miller later said in court, they were well lubricated.

Miller deposited himself at a restaurant near the consulate, while Ogorodnikov walked inside. Before they separated, prosecutors later said, Miller gave her his FBI credentials, to prove his identity to the Soviets, and a copy of a classified FBI counterintelligence reporting manual, to prove his access to documents. After meeting nearby, Ogorodnikov and Miller drove to a motel out in the East Bay to continue their boozy rendezvous.

The trip set off, for the Bureau, the counterintelligence equivalent of a five-alarm fire. Miller’s bosses in Los Angeles and FBI officials in San Francisco had not been aware of Miller and Ogorodnikov’s dalliance—let alone his potential recruitment—but the San Francisco FBI officials quickly pieced the picture together. “Everything in the Soviet consulate was bugged,” recalls the second former FBI agent. “You couldn’t go into the bathroom there without us knowing about it. We immediately opened an investigation.”

FBI agents swarmed onto the case. Separate teams from San Francisco and Washington, D.C., headed down to Los Angeles to work with agents there. Taps went up on the Ogorodnikovs’ house phone and Miller’s phones. Bugs were surreptitiously placed in Miller’s car, according to media reports at the time.

Yet Ogorodnikov and Miller’s involvement deepened. After their trip to the Bay Area, Ogorodnikov, at the direction of KGB handler Grishin, started coaxing Miller to agree to meet with Soviet officials overseas—preferably a city in a neutral location, like Vienna, or better yet, one in the Eastern Bloc, like Warsaw, to deliver more documents. Ogorodnikov even took the unkempt Miller shopping for more dapper clothes, including a $675 Burberry trench coat and Italian dress shoes, the L.A. Times reported.

He never made the journey. In late September, Miller spotted the FBI surveillance that had been placed on him. Now ensnared, he went to his superiors and claimed that he was in fact acting as a double agent—an explanation that was wholly unconvincing to his FBI colleagues. In early October, Miller was arrested at his home in San Diego County. He broke down and confessed, at length and in detail, to his betrayal—but walked back his story days later, returning to his “secret double agent” alibi.

FBI agents also abruptly arrested Svetlana and Nikolay Ogorodnikov at their Hollywood apartment. “At one point,” recalls the first former FBI counterintelligence agent, hours into her post-arrest interview at the FBI’s Los Angeles offices, “Svetlana asked, ‘Are there two FBIs?’ And I said, ‘What do you mean?’ And she said, ‘Well, you guys are very serious,’” in contrast with Miller.

The FBI agent told Ogorodnikov that they were serious indeed.

Both Ogorodnikovs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage midway through a June 1985 trial; prosecutors said Nikolay helped to support Svetlana’s scheme to ensnare Miller. Grishin, Svetlana’s KGB handler—who was named an unindicted co-conspirator—quietly left the country, shielded by diplomatic immunity. (Svetlana later recanted her confession, but never formally challenged her conviction.)

Miller, however, fought on. His first prosecution, which ended in November 1985, concluded in a mistrial, devastating the FBI. In 1986, at his second trial, he was convicted and given two consecutive life terms, plus an extra 50 years. But the conviction was later reversed on appeal; a higher court ruled that his polygraphs, which prosecutors drew on, were inadmissible as evidence.

Much had changed by 1990, when the third trial was set to commence. The judge who had overseen the first two trials had decided to recuse himself. The original prosecutors had also moved on from the U.S. attorney’s office. (One was later chosen to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency and tapped his former co-prosecutor as his deputy.) The Soviet Union was wobbling toward collapse. The Cold War was essentially over. But the prosecution of a serious episode of Cold War espionage was not.

Schiff, then a Los Angeles-based assistant U.S. attorney in his early 30s, was chosen by his superiors to lead the prosecution for the third trial. Libby accepted his request to join in prosecuting the case. It would be the future House Intelligence Committee chairman’s “first introduction to Russian tradecraft,” Schiff recalls.

Schiff had never found Miller’s double-agent story convincing. “It may be that Miller entered into this relationship initially feeling that he knew exactly what Svetlana was doing and why she was doing it. But he was happy to exploit the situation, and only later, as he became entangled with her, was willing to provide classified information [to her],” the congressman says now. Miller might have come across “in a clownish way,” Schiff argues, but was “really quite manipulative.”

This time, Miller had waived his right to a jury trial, hoping the new judge overseeing the case, who was known for his pro-defense views, might impose less jail time, or perhaps even acquit him entirely. Schiff and Libby, meanwhile, sought to ensure a life sentence for Miller, given what they perceived as the seriousness of his crimes.

The case was a “mammoth undertaking,” recalls Schiff, and “certainly the most important one for the FBI at the time.” During preparations for the trial, he says, he came in contact with “dozens and dozens” of FBI agents who had investigated Miller or worked alongside him, as part of what became, in essence, a crash course for Schiff in the Bureau’s counterintelligence mission and Russian espionage more broadly.

The FBI provided Schiff with a primitive portable phone (“which looked like . . . the nuclear football”), and the young prosecutor was in constant contact with his Bureau counterparts. “They would joke with me that they could tell when I got home at night,” recalls Schiff. “We would work together in the office, then I would be on the phone with them, driving home, with that portable. And then there would be a respite before I would call again after dinner.”

The trial commenced in the summer of 1990, less than a year after the Berlin Wall had fallen. Both Schiff and Libby recall the importance the Bureau attached to securing a conviction, and the attention and resources the case received from the FBI. Even though the evidence against Miller was strong, the prosecution presented some unusual challenges. “FBI agents are trained to detect when they’re being surveilled,” Schiff says. “Miller figured that he was under investigation, and before he could be arrested, he went to his supervisor and laid out what would be his defense.”

In Schiff’s closing argument, recounted in Sleeping With The FBI, he painted a damning portrait of Miller, enumerating the disgraced FBI agent’s compromise step-by-step. Whatever his initial motivations, Schiff said, in the end, Miller—scorned, resentful, sexually “infatuated” with Ogorodnikov—“betrayed his job, his family and the entire community that placed its trust in his hands” by passing classified documents to the Soviets. “This is a case of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order,” he said during this statement, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The judge agreed, in part. Although Miller was found guilty of espionage, the new sentence—20 years—was far less punitive than at the second jury trial, or what Schiff and Libby had hoped. “We fought against it,” Libby recalls. “I did not think it was fair at the time, and I still don’t think it was fair, given what Miller had done.” Still, Miller’s fate was secured. He was now the first FBI agent in U.S. history convicted of espionage.

Miller served a total of nine years and was released in 1994. According to Stanley I. Greenberg, one of Miller’s former lawyers, Miller trained to become a computer technician while in prison, moved back to Utah and remarried. He died about three or four years ago, Greenberg told me.

Svetlana Ogorodnikov was also released from prison in 1994. She later moved to Mexico and married a convicted drug trafficker she had met in prison, re-entered the United States illegally in 1999, and was later a witness in a bizarre torture and murder case, according to the Associated Press. Nikolay Ogorodnikov was released from prison in 1990.

Schiff has thought back to the Miller case over the past two and a half years. As in the 1980s in Los Angeles, during the 2016 presidential campaign the Russian government made a clear attempt to gain leverage over key figures, Schiff says—this time in Donald Trump’s orbit. “Just like in the 1980s with Miller, the Russians looked for people with access to information, and they used a variety of different modalities to entangle them,” Schiff says. “They’ll dangle financial opportunities; they’ll use other ways to exact information. … It does feel like an echo of the past.”

The offer by Russia-connected figures of politically damaging information about the Hillary Clinton campaign proffered to Donald Trump Jr.; former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s gambit to feed the Russian oligarch and Vladimir Putin confidant Oleg Deripaska private updates about the Trump campaign; the discussions, led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and with the candidate’s knowledge, about the construction of a Trump Tower in Moscow, which continued well into the 2016 campaign: These were evidence, Schiff says, of the Russian government’s latent capacity for leverage over key figures in the Trump orbit, including the president himself.

While some Trump associates might not have initially realized the road they were embarking on in engaging with Russian agents, to Schiff, their pleas of ignorance—like Miller’s—ultimately ring false. For example, Manafort, who spent years representing pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine, “had enough experience working with Russian interests to understand how they do business,” Schiff says. Manafort’s longtime business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who supported Manafort’s activities in Kiev and whom the FBI says has longstanding ties to Russian intelligence, “had his own experience to draw on,” Schiff continues. “So, I don’t think this was, in either circumstance, the case of a naïve person who was somehow duped.” (As part of the Mueller investigation, Manafort was convicted on bank fraud and tax fraud charges, and later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his lobbying work in Ukraine. Kilimnik, who is believed to be in Moscow, was also indicted by the special counsel’s office on obstruction of justice charges related to his work with Manafort.)

But Schiff argues that an action need not be criminally prosecutable—as in Miller’s case—to represent a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and therefore be worth investigation. This is why he has demanded that his committee receive all the documents tied to the underlying Trump-Russia counterintelligence probe. The broader matter, he says, is “whether Americans were acting as witting or unwitting agents of a foreign power.”

For Richard Miller, avarice and moral turpitude cracked the door ajar for future compromise. It was pried open by a Russian intelligence agent, who, sensing an easy mark, proceeded to ensnare Miller, until that compromise shaded into outright conspiracy.

The Mueller investigation could not establish that the Trump campaign took that momentous second step. But compromise takes place in a continuum. The counterintelligence world, unlike that of criminal justice, rarely traffics in absolutes. This will likely be, for Schiff, the paramount lesson of the Miller case, as the investigation of the Trump-Russia affair moves from the well-ordered confines of the prosecutor’s office and into what longtime former CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton called the wilderness of mirrors.","This exchange happened every other Tuesday, and each time, the Soviets were tailed by a van full of San Francisco-based FBI counterintelligence officials.

128,Why People Flee Honduras,Politico Magazine,"Hundreds and sometimes thousands at a time, Honduran migrants have joined caravans of Central Americans making their way north through Mexico to seek refuge in the United States. They arrive at the southern border only to face stricter asylum rules from an administration increasingly hostile to their entry. There are a number of reasons people may choose to flee their country, and when they do, it’s not an easy endeavor. Yet, they keep coming because of what they’re hoping to leave behind.

Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Two-thirds of its roughly 9 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and in rural areas, 1 in 5 lives in extreme poverty. With a growing population, combined with high underemployment and limited job opportunities because of a largely agricultural economy, many Hondurans seek opportunity elsewhere. And many who stay are dependent on remittances.

Honduras is one of the deadliest countries in the world and has one of the highest impunity rates. According to an analysis by InSight Crime, gang membership and activity have been on the rise in the past two decades, and the associated violence has hit the country’s urban areas the hardest. Extortion by gangs has forced many to flee in search of more security. Moreover, the Honduran police are both understaffed—in the northern district of San Pedro Sula, home to nearly 230,000 people and where well-known gangs like Barrio 18 and MS-13 operate, just 50 police officers watch over its 189 neighborhoods—and plagued by corruption and abuse.

Violence—particularly domestic and sexual violence—in Honduras has taken or forever changed many women’s and girls lives. Gender-based violence is the second-leading cause of death for women of reproductive age. And in a country where emergency contraception and abortion are banned, even for rape victims, survivors of sexual violence have few options if they become pregnant. They can seek to terminate the pregnancy and risk prison time, or they can go through with it and face one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Latin America. As Jill Filipovic reports for Politico Magazine, for Honduran women, economic instability and physical insecurity are intertwined, and both are exacerbated by long-standing patriarchal social norms in the country.

How World War II Almost Broke American Politics Today we celebrate the war as a feel-good moment of unity. The truth is, the country had harsh divisions we’d recognize today.

When Allied forces launched a dramatic air and sea assault on German-occupied France 75 years ago Thursday, the very scale and audacity of the operation were awe-inspiring. In the early-morning hours of June 6, hordes of planes dropped over 10,000 paratroopers behind enemy lines; hundreds of warships and thousands more landing craft would soon deliver 130,000 troops to the beaches of Normandy—most of them British or American—on the first day of the assault.

It was a remarkable achievement—and one of the reasons why, so many years later, Americans in a divided country now think of THE WORLD WAR II years as a beacon of feel-good unity and patriotism: Glenn Miller tunes on the radio, war bond posters in every window, Rosie the Riveter at her station “all the day long whether rain or shine, she’s a part of the assembly line.”

Story Continued Below

That image, however—the war as a moment of American domestic comity—might come as a surprise to anyone who lived through those years. In fact, the nation that waged that war was racked by deep political divisions, some with echoes that are still reverberating today.

In the years leading up to its entry into World War II, the United States was bitterly divided over the New Deal and vehemently at odds over whether it should enter the conflict erupting in Europe. Even during the war, the country remained beset by racial and ethnic animosities that pitted Protestants against Catholics, Catholics against Jews and white Americans against people of color. Partisan rancor posed a steep barrier to the extreme measures that mobilization required: mass taxation, rationing, wage and price fixing, conscription and surveillance. The business community sharply resisted the shift from civilian to military production. Organized labor loudly demanded its share of wartime prosperity. Even as the country fell in line with this vast expansion of state authority, outwardly uniting behind the war effort, discord boiled just beneath the surface, revealing itself in violent homefront outbursts and acid displays of political demagoguery.

The war almost tore America apart. And yet, it didn’t. The country ultimately rallied behind its popular but controversial wartime president to transform itself into the “arsenal of democracy.”

It’s easy to forget how unlikely an achievement it was. Just four years before D-Day, as Franklin Roosevelt launched his campaign for an unprecedented third term as president, America’s military lay in shambles. With just 175,000 serving on active duty, the U.S. Army ranked 18th in the world—smaller than that of even Switzerland and Bulgaria. When FDR arrived at Ogdensburg, New York, in the spring of 1940, several months before he signed into law a selective service act that instituted a new draft of fighting-aged men, he encountered a woeful scene. Ten thousand troops drilled without equipment, broomsticks substituting for rifles and trucks for tanks. The men “haven’t got the bodies soldiers must have,” worried a seasoned military hand. “They haven’t got the psychology of the soldier.” They were “short-winded and with legs that won’t stand up to a hard match.” The following year, when Japan attacked and largely obliterated the Navy’s Pacific fleet, little remained of America’s capacity to prosecute the war.

The story of how Americans surmounted their fractured political culture to mobilize for D-Day remains a trenchant example, in our own age of discord and division, of how a country desperately wanting for consensus can rally together in a moment of common purpose.

“Our bond with Europe is a bond of race, and not of political ideology,” the famed aviator and outspoken isolationist Charles Lindbergh informed a national radio audience in October 1939. “Racial strength is vital, politics is a luxury.” Urging listeners to close ranks with Germany in common struggle against “Asiatic intruders”—Russians, Persians, Turks and Jews—who would defile America’s “most priceless possession, our inheritance of European blood,” Lindbergh tapped into a deep well of popular nativism. It was a theme he hammered relentlessly from his perch as a spokesperson for the America First Committee, an anti-interventionist organization that marshalled considerable support from prominent names in business and industry to oppose aid to Britain and France. The “three most important groups who have been pressing this country toward war are the British, the Jewish and the Roosevelt administration,” he intoned in a speech two years later.

It wasn’t just Lindbergh. The anti-interventionist movement enjoyed widespread support in 1939 and 1940, and Lindbergh’s brand of anti-interventionist politics—bordering on being pro-Nazi, and laced with a conspiratorial distrust of Jews—was common in circles opposed to Roosevelt’s domestic and foreign policies. The America First Committee included outspoken anti-Semites like Avery Brundage, the former head of the U.S. Olympic Committee who had visited ignominy upon the athletic community when he booted two Jewish runners from the track team at the Berlin games in 1936. In Kansas, the America First state chairman told followers that Eleanor Roosevelt, the leading liberal light in FDR’s White House, was “Jewish,” and Winston Churchill, a “half-Jew.”

Even the most respectable opponents of Roosevelt’s mobilization policy verged on extremism. In an editorial entitled “A Plea for Realism,” the Wall Street Journal argued in 1940 that “our job today is not to stop Hitler,” who had “already determined the broad lines of our national life at least for another generation.” Instead, Americans would better direct their focus to “modernize our thinking and our national planning,” a none-too-subtle nod to Nazi state planning and central power.

Isolationist politics were consistent with the increasingly shrill nature of opposition to the New Deal in the years leading up to Pearl Harbor. Though his overwhelming popularity largely inculcated FDR against political attacks in the first several years of his presidency, by the late 1930s his back was up against the wall. A failed attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, followed by an unsuccessful purge of conservative Democrats in the 1938 primaries, had left the president bruised and battered.

With his domestic policies stalled, conservative opponents of the New Deal felt at greater liberty to attack FDR in sometimes sharp tones, particularly after he broke with over 150 years of tradition and announced his bid for a third term. Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, warned there was “a good deal more danger of the infiltration of totalitarian ideas from the New Deal circle in Washington than there will ever be from any activities of the communists or Nazi bunds.” When Roosevelt asked Congress to pass a conscription act in 1940—a bold move in the heat of a presidential campaign—Republican Congressman Hamilton Fish denounced the measure as “the very essence of Nazism and Hitlerism in the United States.” (The bill passed comfortably with moderate Republican support, but when it came up for reauthorization a year later, the new Congress passed it by just one vote.)

Even Wendell Willkie, the moderate internationalist who wrested the GOP nomination from Taft, unleashed a torrent of vicious charges in the closing days of the campaign, likening the president’s third term as “our very rapid drift toward totalitarianism” and decrying both “state socialism” and “national socialism” (a clear equation of the New Deal with German fascism). “I cannot say that my opponent is consciously aiming at State socialism,” he cautioned, but “every major economic policy of the New Deal is pushing in that direction.”

Roosevelt won his third term, but even after the United States formally entered the war, political culture remained coarse. It wasn’t always clear that Americans would achieve the necessary unity to mobilize and win.

Widespread support for isolationism ended with Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. By a unanimous vote in the Senate and with the lone opposition of Rep. Jeanette Rankin in the House, Congress declared war on the Axis powers, and most Americans quickly rallied behind the war effort. In the four short years between the exercises at Ogdensburg and the invasion of Normandy, Americans came together in mass numbers to raise, equip transport and feed a powerful Army and Navy that included 16 million men and 250,000 women. In total 17 million men and women worked in war production plants, furnishing America and its allies with critical war materiel. At Henry Kaiser’s famed shipyards, workers labored to produce “Liberty Ships”—a process that took 355 days in 1941 but, courtesy of managerial ingenuity and back-to-back shifts, fell to just 56 days by the war’s end. At Willow Run, Ford’s sprawling factory in the woods of Michigan, massive conveyor belts transported an endless train of parts that workers then assembled into bombers. “It is the promise of revenge for Pearl Harbor,” the Detroit Free Press crowed in 1942.

To finance the war effort, some 85 million citizens lent money to the government by purchasing war bonds, thereby becoming holders of America’s rapidly expanding debt. Roughly 42 million people paid federal income taxes for the first time in living memory after 1942, through a new withholding system that survives to this day. In total, Americans willingly diverted over 20 percent of their monthly income to taxes and bonds—a considerable investment in their country’s future and an important contribution to efforts to keep prices in check.

Ordinary people, including many who had worried in recent years whether the New Deal had bloated the size of government in dangerous ways, now sanctioned the expansion of state authority in all walks of life. Powerful new agencies like the War Production Board and the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply controlled the flow of commodities like sugar, meat, rubber and steel and rationed consumer access to basic household items. Businesses engaged in war production agreed to allow unions to organize their work forces, while unions, in turn, agreed to government caps on wage increases—a measure intended to keep wartime inflation in check.

Unlike the Civil War or World War I, the Second World War saw no mass resistance to civilian conscription, no major tax revolts or protests against the expansion of the president’s wartime powers. Remembering the ugly example of World War I, when the federal government viciously scapegoated German Americans and pacifists and attempted to manipulate public opinion, FDR and his advisers generally avoided blunt persuasion and emotion to sell the war. “No hysteria,” Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., directed. “No appeal to hate or fear.”

The administration's desire for unity did not, of course, erase deep-seated racial, ethnic and religious tensions—tensions that flared up as Americans came to chafe at the imposition of greater government control and taxation in the war years. Drawing on the work of thousands of unpaid auxiliary volunteers, the Office of War Information kept close tabs on rumors throughout the war—a surveillance effort that would likely alarm many privacy advocates today. The OWI found that Jews, African Americans and Japanese detainees were the subject of rampant gossip, usually tied in some way to rationing, military service or war production. A police officer in Maricopa, Arizona, reported that his neighbors believed “the Jews in New York are sorting the rubber turned in during the rubber drive and are getting $400 a ton for some of it.” Another OWI informant in Indiana overheard people complain that “the G.D. Jews … are ruining this country. The whole war is a farce. There’s plenty of sugar and plenty of rubber.” Another informant told of a friend who complained, “Roosevelt is putting Jews everywhere. Jewish doctors are on the Examining Boards and they except their own boys.”

If Jews were widely rumored to be profiting from wartime mobilization and skirting military duty, in the South, white communities were rife with rumors that African Americans were stockpiling weapons in advance of a massive race riot. Black domestic workers were rumored to be forming “Eleanor Roosevelt Clubs,” preparing for the day when white women would staff black women’s kitchens. Black soldiers were said to be consorting with, and even marrying, young white women. These fears of caste inversion reflected an ugly response to the limited but appreciable wartime mobility African Americans achieved both in the military and civilian sectors.

Finally, on the west coast, OWI informants encountered widespread rumors that Japanese Americans confined to internment camps were living high off the hog in the camps: consuming meat, sugar and other items that fell under scarce rationing, burning gasoline during long joy rides and buying up household luxuries. Despite government controls on wages and prices, the combination of a flush economy and scarce goods created a hike of 25 percent in the Consumer Price Index between 1939 and 1943. In retrospect, with the miseries of the camps now a subject of national shame, it’s a bitter irony that their occupants were accused of high-living, but anti-Japanese rumors struck at the fear that someone was benefiting from the wartime economy at the expense of everyone else. Anti-Japanese incitement was not merely the stuff of popular chitchat. In a typical display of demagoguery, the House Committee on Un-American Activities held hearings that lent a powerful platform to the purveyors of anti-Japanese provocations. “You have got a number of people here that have got boys in the Army … that have been killed,” one man testified in 1943, “and they walk into a drug store for a Coca-Cola or something and all the Japanese have all the seats.” Rep. Karl Mundt echoed this slur, complaining that “we are feeding their Japanese better than our white citizens.”

Rumors sometimes incited violence. In Detroit in June 1943, word spread among white neighborhoods that a group of black hoodlums had slit the throat of a white soldier and raped his girlfriend. The rioting that ensued claimed 34 lives, injured 675 others and took an expensive toll on property. Later that summer, when a white policeman shot a black soldier in Harlem, variations on the story circulated widely in the black community, leading to a massive commodity riot that left hundreds of storefronts shattered and looted. In both cases, underlying tensions related to wartime mobilization expressed themselves in violent conflagrations.

In Los Angeles that same summer, scores of off-duty sailors viciously attacked young Latino men who sported “zoot suits”—flashy attire that typically included baggy, trousers, wide-lapeled jackets, watch fobs and flamboyant hats. Forming “taxicab brigades,” the sailors systematically located and savagely beat and “de-zooted” the young men, whose attire probably violated rationing restrictions against pleats and on the length of material permitted for men’s clothing. Once again, a minority population bore the brunt of popular dissatisfaction with sacrifices imposed by the wartime state.



***

Partisanship among politicians also increased markedly during the war years. In 1944 it was all but a foregone conclusion that FDR would run for a fourth term. As a popular and probably apocryphal story went: When the president visited North Africa, a soldier who happened upon his open-top car cried out, “Oh my God!” “Just for one more term, son,” FDR purportedly quipped.

For many Americans, and particularly for Republicans, who had been shut out of the White House since 1933, it seemed no laughing matter. A fourth term would crown the president a king—and the king, they were convinced, was a communist. The conservative press railed against “the New Deal-Communist axis” (New York Daily Mirror) and claimed “the people who support the New Deal … are supporting the Communists and building them up for the day when they plan to bring the Red Terror sweeping down upon America” (Chicago Tribune). John Bricker, the GOP nominee for vice president, warned that “insidious and ominous are the forces of communism linked with irreligion that are worming their way into national life. … First the New Deal took over the Democratic Party and destroyed its very foundation. Now these Communist forces have taken over the New Deal.” Governor Thomas Dewey of New York, FDR’s opponent in 1944, called the president “indispensable to Earl Browder,” the American communist leader. In case voters missed the point, he later clarified: “In Russia a Communist is a man who supports the Government. In America a Communist is a man who supports the fourth term so our form of government may more easily be changed.”

It was a filthy fight, and all the more so with so many soldiers and sailors fighting abroad. The president won comfortably, but with a smaller margin than in any of his previous elections.

In other ways, the spirit of unity and comraderie that we remember may over-sentimentalize a more complicated story. Then and later, private sector barons who turned out tanks and rifles for the Army, and who staffed wartime agencies as “dollar a year men,” congratulated themselves on the victory of free markets over the state economies of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. “If Free Enterprise has not flourished here,” wrote the Saturday Evening Post, “the cause of world freedom might be lost for centuries.” Capitalism, it claimed, was “the last bulwark of civilization,” and the reason America prevailed was “mass employment, mass production, mass advertising, mass distribution and mass ownership of the products of industry.”

This spirit of triumphalism masked a darker reality: In 1940 and 1941, the Roosevelt administration faced widespread resistance, particularly from auto companies, to switch from civilian to war production. The reason Chrysler converted to tank building, and Ford to bombers, was that the government was compelled to offer “cost-plus” contracts that guaranteed defense manufacturers a profit, no matter the efficiency of production. America’s triumph in World War II did not derive from the magic of private-sector genius. It owed to precisely the brand of top-down, state planning that business leaders disdained during the New Deal era but learned to love when it delivered reliable profits in war years.

Organized labor, too, proved capable of exerting self-interest. With the economy operating at full employment, people implicitly understood that it was a seller’s workplace. Absenteeism climbed as high as 25 percent in key defense industries, and wildcat strikes became a chronic headache for employers. When John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers took his members out on strike in 1943, FDR used troops to seize at least one mine and threatened to have strikers drafted into military service.

It should not surprise us that people could act both for the greater good and out of personal motivation. Wars are seldom one-dimensional political events, and people fight and mobilize for them out of a mix of emotions. A survey in 1942 found that 90 percent of respondents could not name a single provision of the Atlantic Charter, a joint declaration by the United States and Great Britain that delineated a clear and high-minded vision for the post-war world. A majority of those surveyed openly volunteered that they had “no clear idea what the war is all about.” Neither could they name all of FDR’s Four Freedoms, principles that the president laid out before Congress in 1941. That didn't mean that people acted without ideology. Surveys found that citizens bought war bonds and volunteered for military service out of a vague but very clear sense of patriotism, duty to their communities and to the soldiers and sailors who hailed from those communities and a sense of moral purpose that may not have found easy reference in a political document. At the same time, surveys also showed that Americans believed they were fighting for a better standard of living in the post-war period—for the promise of homes, jobs and an end to Depression-era scarcity and wartime rationing. The motives that drove ordinary people were both high-minded and parochial. It wasn't either/or.

A country that could scarcely outfit its small Army with rifles in 1940 emerged within four years to outfit one of the most formidable militaries in modern history. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill had likened the United States to a “gigantic boiler. Once the fire is lighted under it, there is no limit to the power it can generate.”

Seventy-five years ago, Operation Overlord proved Churchill right, as Americans saw the culmination of a collective effort unprecedented and since unseen—made all the more remarkable by its successful navigation of very real divisions that threatened, but did not break, the public spirit.","How World War II Almost Broke American Politics Today we celebrate the war as a feel-good moment of unity.

DRIVING THE DAY

THE HOUSE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE GETS CROSSWISE WITH MCCARTHY AND SCALISE … On Tuesday, House Majority Leader STENY HOYER hosted House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY, House Minority Whip STEVE SCALISE (R-La.) and Rep. CEDRIC RICHMOND (D-La.) for a private meeting to negotiate a deal to give members a pay raise.

IT’S TYPICALLY A THORNY topic, but both McCarthy and Scalise have cautiously embraced giving lawmakers a bump in their compensation. (The salary for House members has been at $174,000 since 2009 -- which also freezes staff salary.) McCarthy told NBC in May that he is open to it, because it’s been a decade since Congress got a cost-of-living adjustment and lawmakers are leaving the job over the pay. Scalise has said “it ought to be looked at” because Congress shouldn’t be a place where only wealthy people can afford to serve.

TUESDAY’S MEETING, went well, sources told us, and the two sides were moving toward a deal.

THEN, ONE DAY AFTER THE MEETING, THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE sent an email blasting Democrats for considering a pay raise -- staking out a position in direct conflict with GOP party leaders.

-- HERE’S WHAT THE NRCC’S EMAIL SAID: “After campaigning on a slogan of ‘for the people,’ the socialist Democrats have accomplished a whole lot of nothing 6 months into their majority. And as a reward for their incompetence, they want middle-class taxpayers to give them a $4,500 pay raise! Apparently making $174,000 a year, which is more than three times the average American’s salary, just isn’t enough for these socialist elitists. Between voting for the public to finance their campaigns, opposing middle-class tax cuts and pushing to give themselves raises, the socialist Democrats’ need to change their motto to ‘for the politicians.’”

YES, this is the NRCC blasting Democrats for embracing a position that MCCARTHY and SCALISE also hold. Needless to say, this did not sit well with many in the GOP leadership. People wondered why exactly the NRCC was taking a position contrary to top Republicans in the House.

THE NRCC’S CHRIS PACK said this in response: “With the exception of making anti-Semitism and socialism a cornerstone of their party’s platform and trying to fleece taxpayers to pay for their political campaigns, the socialist Democrats have accomplished precisely nothing since taking over the chamber. Perhaps they should actually do something – anything – to justify their paycheck. That’s the point of our release.”

THIS HAS LED TO A SERIOUS ROUND OF SNIPING … A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE MEETING said this: “McCarthy and Hoyer each agreed in that meeting to take care of their own committees and make sure that if this went forward, neither side would attack each other. Less than 24 hours later, NRCC sent out that email slamming Democrats for doing it. So either McCarthy dropped the ball, or the NRCC dropped the ball.”

THE NRCC -- which is supported, in part, by lawmaker dues -- did not respond when asked whether it was aware of McCarthy’s agreement with Hoyer when it issued the release criticizing the pay raise.

WELL, THAT DIDN’T TAKE LONG … JOE BIDEN, under fire from his rivals in the Democratic primary, dropped his long-standing support of the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funds from being used to pay for abortions. The politics of this little dance are not great for Biden, though as we pointed out Thursday, pretty much every member of Congress (including the 15 current and former members running for president) has voted in favor of the Hyde Amendment at some point.

TARIFF UPDATE -- “Mexico aims to avoid tariffs with potential deal limiting migrants going north, allowing U.S. to deport Central American asylum seekers,” by WaPo’s Nick Miroff, David Lynch and Kevin Sieff: “U.S. and Mexican officials are discussing the outlines of a deal that would dramatically increase Mexico’s immigration enforcement efforts and give the United States far more latitude to deport Central Americans seeking asylum, according to a U.S. official and a Mexican official who cautioned that the accord is not final and that President Trump might not accept it.” WaPo

-- THE WSJ’S MORE PESSIMISTIC READING: “The Trump administration has made significant progress in its border-security negotiations with Mexico, a senior White House official said, but the U.S. remained on track to impose tariffs on the country’s imports next week.” WSJ

-- IF THE UNITED STATES is going to levy the 5% tariff on Mexico come Monday, it has to issue a public statement today, sources tell us. President DONALD TRUMP is slated to return from Ireland this afternoon, and will land at Andrews around 4:25 p.m.

DEPT. OF IF THINGS GO SIDEWAYS … WSJ’S NICK TIMIRAOS: “Fed Begins Debate on Whether to Cut Rate as Soon as June: Trade tensions darken economic outlook, raising possibility of interest-rate cut in weeks or months ahead”: “A month ago, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell played down speculation of a rate cut this summer. Now officials at the central bank face a darker economic outlook and heightened trade tensions, making a rate cut possible—if not at their meeting on June 18-19, then in July or later.

“The officials need to decide what would trigger such action, how much more information they want before making a decision and how to signal their intentions and plans. They are to begin their customary premeeting quiet period at the end of this week.

“Traders in futures markets have signaled about a 20% chance of a rate cut at the June 18-19 meeting, and a 70% chance of at least one cut by the meeting after that, on July 30-31, according to CME Group. Unlike in May, Fed officials haven’t expressly pushed back against the market pricing in rate cuts in recent days.” WSJ

THE INVESTIGATIONS … ANDREW DESIDERIO -- “DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs”: “The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

“In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.” POLITICO

-- CUMMINGS RESPONDS, via a statement off embargo this morning: “We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress. They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up.

“The letters last night were case studies in double-speak. They claim that fighting witness interviews for months under threat of subpoena is evidence of a ‘good faith accommodations process,’ they suggest that Secretary Ross’ refusal to meet demonstrates that the Department ‘is eager to continue its cooperation with the Committee,’ and they argue that withholding every single one of the key unredacted documents we subpoenaed somehow proves that ‘there is no information to hide.’”

2020 WATCH -- KNOWING MAYA HARRIS, via Chris Cadelago: “Since launching her White House bid, no figure in Kamala Harris’ orbit has loomed so large. A regular presence on the trail, Maya [Harris] has been involved in virtually every facet of the race, from soliciting donors and recruiting the most diverse staff of any Democratic hopeful, to helping draft policy and talking up early state politicos.

“A no-nonsense boss who became a single mom at 17 and earned a law degree from Stanford before embarking on a long career in progressive activism, she’s emerged as a primary attraction in her own right. Aside from standing in for Kamala at fundraisers, Maya can be seen at campaign stops posing for pictures with selfie seekers who recognize her from social media and her time as an MSNBC talking head — a gig she landed after advising Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

“Maya is often the first point of contact for her sister in early states, where officials and operatives said she frequently touches base to gauge the lay of the land. In South Carolina, Marguerite Willis said she was eager to meet Maya because she speaks with authority for the candidate. Willis’ own sister was the No. 2 in her campaign for governor last year.” POLITICO

MEDIAWATCH -- JEFF GOLDBERG, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, received sharp criticism from media Twitter-land on Thursday because of a quote in an interview he gave to Laura Hazard Owen of Nieman Lab in which he said: “It’s really, really hard to write a 10,000-word cover story. There are not a lot of journalists in America who can do it. The journalists in America who do it are almost exclusively white males.”

The Washington Post’s Monica Hesse tweeted: “What’s interesting to me is how patently false this is, even within his own newsroom. Many of the strongest feature writers at The Atlantic are women: Caitlin Flanagan, Amanda Mull, Elaina Plott, Taylor Lorenz. Did he forget they exist? Why?” HuffPost’s Jessica Schulberg tweeted: “Aside from being patently untrue it blows my mind that the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic still doesn't know better than to say this out loud!!!”

Asked for his version of the events, Goldberg told us: “I remember telling Laura Owen that, ‘The journalists who have been allowed to write cover stories [in the magazine industry] have been almost exclusively white males.’ This was obviously the intent of my quote, and I know -- because Laura told me this -- that she understands this to be the intent. If you read my quotes in context, you’ll see that this is clearly the intent.

“I was hoping that Nieman would issue a clarification on this point but I also recognize that Laura’s piece reflects accurately the many changes we’re implementing at The Atlantic to bring women to leadership, and to the cover of the print magazine as well.” He pointed out that when he became editor-in-chief, 17% of The Atlantic’s newsroom leadership was female but now it’s 63%.

He also told us: “[O]bviously I failed to phrase it in a way that makes people understand what I was saying or make some people understand what I was saying.” Asked if he had any regrets about what he said, “I regret obviously the way it’s been interpreted. I regret if I’ve hurt anybody, obviously, but my obvious intention was to signal that we’re trying harder than ever and we will continue to try very, very hard.” He said that the criticism online has been “a typical Twitter reaction. I think people assume the very worst. They don’t read the story. They take comments out of context.”

143,Koch network floats backing Democrats in revamp of influence operation,Maggie Severns,"Americans for Prosperity, the policy and political arm of the Koch network, is retooling for the 2020 election cycle. | Paul Vernon/AP Photo elections Koch network floats backing Democrats in revamp of influence operation The onetime tea party powerhouse says it's ready to spend money to protect lawmakers from either party who back its priorities, including helping Dreamers.

The Koch network is shaking up how it tries to influence Washington heading into 2020, starting with plans to spend money to reelect lawmakers from either party who back its issues and are facing primary challenges.

Once a pro-Republican electoral powerhouse, the network that was long led by Charles and David Koch has made major changes to the way it operates in recent years, focusing more on policy and philanthropy and even renaming itself Stand Together to reflect its less political tone. As part of this transition, Americans for Prosperity, the policy and political arm of the network, is retooling for the 2020 election cycle.

Story Continued Below

Some — but definitely not all — of the group’s policy plans may intrigue Democrats. For instance, one of the Koch network's top priorities is extending protection to Dreamers; its stance on that issue has sometimes been met with pushback from its own donors. Under its new approach, the network says it will help defend incumbent lawmakers in primaries, encouraging lawmakers to be less risk-averse and work together on Koch-backed policies.

The moves are designed to enable the network to further its priorities and, in the words of a new memo, “elevate civil discourse” in Washington and elsewhere. The network will also start four new PACs focused on policy issues to reward lawmakers that are in step with Koch policy. Though the network has changed, it still has the ability to pour millions into television ads and knock on thousands of doors to help candidates, in addition to donating directly to their campaigns.

“We expect policymakers to unite people and build coalitions. We’re committed to forging a new way forward with political discourse,” said Emily Seidel, CEO of Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview. “We’re excited for how this new approach will help policymakers work together.”

POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

The approach is a far cry from the years when the brothers helmed a constellation of groups that bolstered the anti-establishment tea party movement, earning the Koch brothers status as Republican super villains among the left and good-government reformers.

But especially since Donald Trump’s nomination as the Republican candidate during the 2016 elections — which the network did not support — the Kochs have been shifting their focus. Charles Koch’s son, Chase, who is expected to lead the network when his 83-year-old father eventually departs, is uninterested in partisan politics. And the network has, at least for now, turned away from presidential politics: The network is not spending money to help reelect Trump, who Charles Koch has publicly criticized in the past, in 2020.

The network has not said how much money it will spend to bolster its political and policy goals during the 2020 election cycle. That will depend on whether priorities outlined by the network are getting done, Seidel said.

“I would love to come back and tell you we are increasing our investment, because that means government is actually working and getting things accomplished,” Seidel said.

Network officials characterized the changes as an expansion of Americans for Prosperity and emphasized the new approach is designed to encourage bipartisanship. And Americans for Prosperity won’t set a divisive tone in the TV ads or mailers it sends about candidates either, according to the memo authored by Seidel.

“AFP and AFP Action’s advocacy efforts will lead with a positive vision and focus on the issues,” the memo says. “Going forward, we will expect the same of candidates we support politically. … If candidates engage in personal, ad hominem attacks and other divisive tactics during their election, it makes it difficult for them to work productively with others after the election.”

The network is also adding four new policy-focused PACs that will operate separately from Americans for Prosperity: Uniting for Economic Opportunity, which will focus on issues like the budget and curbing government over-regulation; Uniting for Free Expression, which focuses on free speech issues; and trade- and immigration-focused PACs called Uniting for Free Trade and Uniting for Immigration Reform.

Though some of its plans may appeal to Democrats, when it comes to the network’s long-standing desires to cut spending and slash the size of the federal government, the Koch network is unlikely to find much Democratic support. It also helped successfully push for tax reform during the early days of Trump’s presidency and has advocated for environmental deregulation that incenses the left.

Only rarely has the Koch network involved itself in primary battles in the past, and typically in extraordinary circumstances. It spent money to help then-Rep. Mike Pompeo — who represents the Koch Industries headquarters region in Wichita, Kansas — beat back a challenge from his predecessor in Congress, who tried to run for his old seat. Koch groups also spent to defeat then-Rep. Renee Ellmers in a member-vs.-member primary during the 2016 elections, citing the North Carolina congresswoman's record on government spending as its cause.

But North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was an early test case for the Koch’s bipartisan approach to election spending during the general 2018 elections: After she voted in favor of a bill relaxing some financial regulations in the Dodd-Frank law, the network ran digital advertisements in Heitkamp’s favor. It later decided to eschew supporting Heitkamp’s Republican opponent in the race, then-Rep. Kevin Cramer, saying he was insufficiently supportive of Koch priorities like free trade — saving Heitkamp from artillery in the form of what could have been millions of dollars worth of television ads and other election spending.

Asked whether she planned to seek the Koch’s endorsement in the race, which she ultimately lost to Cramer, Heitkamp told POLITICO she did not.","Americans for Prosperity, the policy and political arm of the Koch network, is retooling for the 2020 election cycle.

Only rarely has the Koch network involved itself in primary battles in the past, and typically in extraordinary circumstances. It spent money to help then-Rep. Mike Pompeo — who represents the Koch Industries headquarters region in Wichita, Kansas — beat back a challenge from his predecessor in Congress, who tried to run for his old seat. Koch groups also spent to defeat then-Rep. Renee Ellmers in a member-vs.-member primary during the 2016 elections, citing the North Carolina congresswoman's record on government spending as its cause.

But North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was an early test case for the Koch’s bipartisan approach to election spending during the general 2018 elections: After she voted in favor of a bill relaxing some financial regulations in the Dodd-Frank law, the network ran digital advertisements in Heitkamp’s favor. It later decided to eschew supporting Heitkamp’s Republican opponent in the race, then-Rep. Kevin Cramer, saying he was insufficiently supportive of Koch priorities like free trade — saving Heitkamp from artillery in the form of what could have been millions of dollars worth of television ads and other election spending.

Asked whether she planned to seek the Koch’s endorsement in the race, which she ultimately lost to Cramer, Heitkamp told POLITICO she did not.","Americans for Prosperity, the policy and political arm of the Koch network, is retooling for the 2020 election cycle.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida’s Democrats, who have been battered by a string of narrow yet demoralizing defeats, once again are saying wait until next year.

“We are close to the mountain top but we have got to keep fighting,” said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

Story Continued Below

Perez is joining state Democratic leaders as they flock to the Orlando area this weekend for Leadership Blue, the party's biggest annual fundraiser. Coming off a state losing streak that stretches back to 2012, the party is assembling in the nation’s biggest swing state less than two weeks before President Donald Trump returns to the same area to officially kick off his reelection campaign.

Three years ago, Republicans and Trump put together a turnout machine that swamped Democrats in Florida on Election Day. The GOP replicated that success again in 2018, defying a national trend that saw Democrats taking control of the House for the first time in eight years.

Perez, in an interview with POLITICO, promised that 2020 will, somehow, be different. He is heading to Florida with a revamped playbook that he said will bring the Sunshine State into the Democrats’ win column. The party is organizing and spending earlier, focusing on increased voter registration, and hiring, and training field organizers.

Perez said he is optimistic because Democrats have lost by “razor-thin margins” in the last two cycles. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, won narrowly against Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum last year. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by only 113,000 votes two years earlier.

The Democratic strategy includes widening outreach efforts beyond party strongholds in three south Florida counties. The party has purchased more than 7 million cellphone numbers it will use to reach out to voters and is training “homegrown” organizers instead of “parachuting” campaign workers in from other states, Perez said.

“The key to success in Florida is that you have to recognize that you have to be an every year, every month party, and you have to be an every ZIP code party,” he said.

Beyond the organizational muscle, the DNC will invest record amounts of money in Florida, Perez said. So far, the DNC has transferred roughly $40,000 to the Florida Democratic Party’s federal account, campaign records show.

Republicans scoffed and mocked Perez’s strategy to win Florida.

“Our game plan is to focus on a roaring economy, improving schools, low taxes and a plan to save Florida’s environment for generations,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and Trump ally.

Blaise Ingoglia, a state legislator who led the Republican Party of Florida when Trump and DeSantis were elected, said the Democratic Party’s’ “new game plan” is the “same ol’ game plan” that party officials — including state chairwoman Terrie Rizzo — “tried to implement last election.”

“That didn’t work out too well for them,” Ingoglia said. “In Florida, if they try once again to take their leftist, socialist policy suggestions to voters it will backfire no matter how much money they spend.”

Perez said Democrats will do more to push back against what he labeled Republican efforts at “voter suppression,” highlighting a 2018 lawsuit that challenged the process for vote-by-mail ballot signatures and a bill passed by Florida’s Republican-controlled state Legislature that makes it more difficult for ex-felons to have their voting rights restored.

Democrats in Florida recently launched an “election protection” team led by an attorney whose job will be to have a network of lawyers ready to spring into action between now and Election Day.

“We understand that they’re going to lie and cheat and it’s worked for them before, so why wouldn’t they do it again?” Perez said. “It’s un-American, it’s undemocratic, it’s unconscionable.”

Gaetz predicted that cries of voter suppression wouldn’t boost turnout.

“With campaigns built around voter suppression as a rallying cry, it’s no surprise Democratic voters feel less motivated than, say, voters in my district who voted like crazy in the midterms,” said Gaetz, who represents a staunchly conservative district in the Florida Panhandle.

Perez, Ingoglia said, “should stop making excuses for another Florida loss in advance.”","| AP Photo Florida Democrats aim to end a string of deflating losses.

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

A spokeswoman for Cummings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comment this week that she would rather see President Donald Trump “in prison” than impeached “shows the true colors of the Democratic Party,” the White House said Thursday.

“How shocking,"" White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp said sarcastically in an interview on Fox News. ""The Democrats are radical and out of touch. They're more focused on attacking this president, undermining this president, than they are to solving the major problems that we're seeing in the United States.”

Pelosi made the comment during a meeting Tuesday night in which she clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler about whether to open an impeachment inquiry into the president. Pelosi, who’s resisted a growing chorus of calls for impeachment from her caucus, remained firm in that she wants to see Trump defeated at the ballot box next year, when he would then be free from the Justice Department’s restraints on indicting a sitting president.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” Pelosi said at that meeting, multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting told POLITICO.

“I think it clearly shows the true colors of Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Party that are focused and obsessed with investigation after investigation despite the fact that the president and this administration has been transparent through the whole process,” Schlapp contended Thursday.

Asked whether Pelosi’s leaked comments would further imperil the White House’s willingness or ability to work with congressional Democrats on things like infrastructure, Schlapp indicated that not much has changed.

“Look, I think that this president, this administration has tried time and time again to work with the Democrats,” she said, though it has been Trump who orchestrated several high-profile walkouts of meetings with Democrats. “The Democrats have continuously refused to work with our administration in solving the major problems we see in our country.”

She pointed in particular to the surging number of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and cast Trump as doing what he’s able with his hands tied.

House Democratic leaders are preparing to grant sweeping authority to committee chairs to sue the Trump administration over its refusal to comply with congressional demands for information — from President Donald Trump's tax returns to former special counsel Robert Mueller’s underlying files.

The draft resolution, which the House will consider on Tuesday, formally holds Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for defying House Judiciary Committee subpoenas seeking Mueller’s unredacted report, its underlying evidence, and additional witness testimony.

But the most dramatic proposal will empower the chairs of all House committees to initiate legal action each time a witness or administration official defies a committee subpoena, a move to streamline and speed up the House’s ability to respond to a mounting list of confrontations with the White House.

Under the proposal, committee chairs seeking to enforce its subpoenas in federal court would still be required to obtain the approval of a bipartisan — but Democrat-controlled — panel of House leaders that includes Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise.

The resolution can also apply to subpoenas that have not yet been issued. Committee leaders will have the authority to enforce those subpoenas without requiring the full House to vote on each one. Democrats emphasize that the reason for the wholesale change is to prevent contempt citations from dominating House's limited floor time.

“There’s a concern that there could be a lot of floor time eaten up if we handle these one at a time,"" said a Democratic congressional aide. “We are carefully prioritizing the fights we choose to elevate to this level.”

The move is a reflection of rising frustration among Democrats, who have been largely stymied in their efforts to investigate Mueller’s findings because of roadblocks thrown up by the Trump White House. Though the stonewalling has led some Democrats to demand impeachment proceedings, Democrats like Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler have indicated that empowering committees to take their fights to court could help force witness testimony and the production of key documents.

“We are re-affirming the power of the committees to get subpoenas in response to what’s really an unprecedented intent to prevent a co-equal branch of government from doing its constitutional duties,” said another Democratic aide.

Additionally, the resolution empowers House General Counsel Douglas Letter to use outside attorneys to assist House Democrats in federal court. The House Rules Committee will review and potentially revise the resolution on Monday.

Tuesday’s full House vote will mark House Democrats’ most dramatic effort to date to enforce its subpoenas for documents and witness testimony that Trump has sought to block.

The Judiciary Committee held Barr in contempt last month after he refused to provide the committee with Mueller’s complete report and underlying evidence. The committee subsequently subpoenaed McGahn — one of Mueller’s central witnesses — after he acquiesced to a White House directive that he decline to testify.

House Democrats have already secured two key victories in federal court after Trump sought to invalidate their subpoenas seeking his personal and business financial records. Trump, who filed lawsuits challenging the subpoenas in his personal capacity, has appealed those rulings.

But House Democrats have yet to engage directly with the White House in their lawsuits. Tuesday’s vote will give them that sweeping authority.

House Democratic leaders are preparing to grant sweeping authority to committee chairs to sue the Trump administration over its refusal to comply with congressional demands for information — from President Donald Trump's tax returns to former special counsel Robert Mueller’s underlying files.

The draft resolution, which the House will consider on Tuesday, formally holds Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for defying House Judiciary Committee subpoenas seeking Mueller’s unredacted report, its underlying evidence, and additional witness testimony.

But the most dramatic proposal will empower the chairs of all House committees to initiate legal action each time a witness or administration official defies a committee subpoena, a move to streamline and speed up the House’s ability to respond to a mounting list of confrontations with the White House.

Under the proposal, committee chairs seeking to enforce its subpoenas in federal court would still be required to obtain the approval of a bipartisan — but Democrat-controlled — panel of House leaders that includes Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise.

The resolution can also apply to subpoenas that have not yet been issued. Committee leaders will have the authority to enforce those subpoenas without requiring the full House to vote on each one. Democrats emphasize that the reason for the wholesale change is to prevent contempt citations from dominating House's limited floor time.

“There’s a concern that there could be a lot of floor time eaten up if we handle these one at a time,"" said a Democratic congressional aide. “We are carefully prioritizing the fights we choose to elevate to this level.”

The move is a reflection of rising frustration among Democrats, who have been largely stymied in their efforts to investigate Mueller’s findings because of roadblocks thrown up by the Trump White House. Though the stonewalling has led some Democrats to demand impeachment proceedings, Democrats like Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler have indicated that empowering committees to take their fights to court could help force witness testimony and the production of key documents.

“We are re-affirming the power of the committees to get subpoenas in response to what’s really an unprecedented intent to prevent a co-equal branch of government from doing its constitutional duties,” said another Democratic aide.

Additionally, the resolution empowers House General Counsel Douglas Letter to use outside attorneys to assist House Democrats in federal court. The House Rules Committee will review and potentially revise the resolution on Monday.

Tuesday’s full House vote will mark House Democrats’ most dramatic effort to date to enforce its subpoenas for documents and witness testimony that Trump has sought to block.

The Judiciary Committee held Barr in contempt last month after he refused to provide the committee with Mueller’s complete report and underlying evidence. The committee subsequently subpoenaed McGahn — one of Mueller’s central witnesses — after he acquiesced to a White House directive that he decline to testify.

House Democrats have already secured two key victories in federal court after Trump sought to invalidate their subpoenas seeking his personal and business financial records. Trump, who filed lawsuits challenging the subpoenas in his personal capacity, has appealed those rulings.

But House Democrats have yet to engage directly with the White House in their lawsuits. Tuesday’s vote will give them that sweeping authority.

President Donald Trump Thursday signed a package that would deliver $19.1 billion in disaster relief to communities across the country that are still recovering from a spate of catastrophic hurricanes, wildfires and flooding.

The House passed the bill on Monday after Republicans successfully thwarted three attempts to fast-track the package. The Senate passed the bill before the Memorial Day recess, removing Trump’s request for billions in emergency border aid in a last-minute scramble because it was holding up the deal. The legislation was delayed for months prior to that amid partisan infighting.

Story Continued Below

The more than 70-page bill includes $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico, in addition to $304 million in new Community Development Block Grant funding for the island and language ensuring that Puerto Rico can access billions in already-appropriated CDBG funds that Democrats accused the Trump administration of slow-walking.

It provides $3 billion for farmers to help cover crop losses, $1.6 billion to help repair damaged highways, $720 million for the U.S. Forest Service to help cover wildfire suppression efforts and $120 million to help the National Park Service repair damaged public lands.

The bill also provides $670 million to the Air Force to repair hurricane damage at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and flooding damage at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.

The package extends the National Flood Insurance Program through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.

Betty McCollum expressed their concerns to the president in a letter. | Alex Edelman/Getty Images congress Democrats urge Trump to rethink July 4 plans

Three senior House Democrats are urging President Donald Trump to reconsider his plans to speak at the Fourth of July celebration on the National Mall.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who oversees the Appropriations subpanel that funds Interior, expressed fears Trump's plans ""could create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense"" and waste taxpayer dollars.

Story Continued Below

""For decades, the Fourth of July on the National Mall has been non-partisan and apolitical,"" they wrote in a letter Thursday. ""We respectfully call on you to look for ways to complement, not conflict with, the Fourth of July celebration, such as considering an earlier time or alternative location for your remarks.""

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promised a Senate Appropriations subpanel in late May he would ensure Trump's remarks were non-partisan and would not aggrandize him, which would violate federal spending laws.

""I think it's fantastic that the president might take time to join folks on the National Mall to celebrate America's Independence Day,"" Bernhardt said in response to a question from Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). ""I will make absolutely sure that every dollar we spend will comply with the law — I will promise you that.""

Trump first announced his plans for a ""major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me!"" in a late February tweet.

156,‘Everyone is used to relatives that are doofuses’: Kamala Harris’ sister breaks from tradition,Christopher Cadelago,"Maya Harris, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' sister, has served as a loyal confidant in her sister's campaign. | Emma McIntyre/Getty Images 2020 elections ‘Everyone is used to relatives that are doofuses’: Kamala Harris’ sister breaks from tradition Maya Harris is serving as chief adviser and alter ego to her big sister.

Kamala Harris’ campaign held a pair of intimate fundraisers last week in New York and Connecticut, where two dozen or so guests gathered at each event to hear the headliner offer a glimpse of the inner sanctum.

The featured guest, however, was not the candidate; Kamala didn’t attend. It was Maya Harris, her campaign chair and younger sister.

Story Continued Below

Since launching her White House bid, no figure in Kamala Harris’ orbit has loomed so large. A regular presence on the trail, Maya has been involved in virtually every facet of the race, from soliciting donors and recruiting the most diverse staff of any Democratic hopeful, to helping draft policy and talking up early state politicos.

A no-nonsense boss who became a single mom at 17 and earned a law degree from Stanford before embarking on a long career in progressive activism, she’s emerged as a primary attraction in her own right. Aside from standing in for Kamala at fundraisers, Maya can be seen at campaign stops posing for pictures with selfie seekers who recognize her from social media and her time as an MSNBC talking head — a gig she landed after advising Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

Maya is often the first point of contact for her sister in early states, where officials and operatives said she frequently touches base to gauge the lay of the land. In South Carolina, Marguerite Willis said she was eager to meet Maya because she speaks with authority for the candidate. Willis’ own sister was the No. 2 in her campaign for governor last year.

“It’s as close in the world to having a double as it gets,” Willis said of Maya.

Willis reached out to Maya on Twitter, and they met in Columbia, S.C. She ended up endorsing Kamala, as did several others who first connected with her sister: Willis’ running-mate, state Sen. John Scott, and Constance Anastopoulo, a past nominee for state attorney general.

On a recent swing though South Carolina, Maya broke away from the trail to lead a call with women's health organizations on Kamala’s newly released abortion plan.

“If Kamala Harris isn’t part of it, it’s Maya Harris,” said Juan Rodriguez, Kamala’s campaign manager. “Our constant job is finding out where she can help us expand our bandwidth.”

Political families have long been a public fixation, with spouses and siblings filling official and unofficial roles, from confidant to security blanket and everything in between. But the fascination seems to have reached new heights in the Trump era: The president has appointed his relatives to posts they probably wouldn’t have landed if not for their ties to him.

Maya, who headed up the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California on her way to becoming a well-known civil rights advocate, is a different story. The 52-year-old — who holds the post that John Podesta had for the Clinton campaign, and has been aspirationally referred to by political types as Kamala’s Bobby Kennedy — would almost certainly be serving in a Clinton administration had she won.

“Everyone is used to relatives that are doofuses,” said Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, who brought in Maya as a senior fellow in 2013. There, she authored a prescient paper on politics titled, “Women of Color: A Growing Force in the American Electorate.”

“When you have a relative that is competent and capable, what does that mean?” Tanden asked.

Maya’s close relationship with her older sister hasn’t shielded her from internal disputes about the direction and message of the campaign. Kamala fosters an environment of creative tension that aides describe as part-Socratic method, part mock court. Aides on opposite sides of an issue present their case — backed up by research, because anything less is dismissed — and the former prosecutor acts as judge.

Maya, according to campaign sources, is acutely aware of the liabilities that her sister’s law enforcement record poses with Democratic voters who’ve moved left on criminal justice reform. She’s given voice internally to those concerns — and how to address them politically — while serving as a conduit to activists on the outside with hesitations about Kamala.

The candidate herself has shown sensitivity about her record, including on school truancy and independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. As her campaign has unfolded, she’s offered more nuanced — and at times contradictory — stances than she did as California’s top law enforcement official.

But in backing away from her past, some aides and advisers believe she risks weakening her main argument: that she has the backbone to take the fight to Trump. Along with Maya, family input comes from her husband, Doug Emhoff, and Maya’s spouse, Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber and the Justice Department’s third-ranking official under President Barack Obama.

“Family members — if used right — can play a big role,” said a Kamala confidant familiar with her campaign’s dynamics. The person added that campaign aides have used family members to deliver messages that Kamala wasn’t immediately receptive to. “It’s a matter of utilizing them strategically and in spots where it makes the most sense — and not as the center-point of campaign strategy.”

Kamala declined to address a question about the advice she’s receiving. Asked about Maya’s role in the campaign, Kamala leafed through her sister’s resume—from her time, at age 29, as one of the youngest law school deans in the country to being a vice president at the Ford Foundation, where she worked on social justice and democracy issues.

“I think most people who know Maya will tell you she’s one of the smartest people they know,” Kamala said. “The fact that she has volunteered to work on this campaign at such a high level, and she’s exactly who she’s always been—she works around the clock and she’s probably the hardest, if not one of the hardest working people on the campaign—I feel very blessed.”

Maya’s own “radical, left-wing politics,” as one friend affectionately put it, appears in her work and through an extensive contact list that’s outside her sister’s sphere: “She has activists, radicals and revolutionaries on her speed dial,” the friend said.

At PolicyLink, which advocates for racial and economic equity, Maya wrote about community-centered policing practices and was the lead author of an activist’s guide to police reform. She helped edit manuscripts of the New York Times bestseller “The New Jim Crow,” by legal scholar Michelle Alexander, which argued that ""we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.""

Yet it was her policy work for Clinton that transformed Maya into a major player in electoral politics. She won Clinton’s trust by taking on difficult issues around criminal justice reform, recalled Minyon Moore, a senior adviser to the 2016 campaign. Moore insists Maya is not an ideologue despite her progressive beliefs.

“Maya was the one that was always asking the tough questions even when Hillary was embracing issues that would make you go, ‘Huh, OK,’” Moore said, keying on the adviser’s skill in framing complex issues. “Maya is not the type of person that is going to pull you left. She is going to pull you to the right position.”

“Hillary loved her. She loved her,” she added.

Maya, who declined to be interviewed for this story, later headed up Clinton’s platform committee, a group comprised of people aligned with the 2016 Democratic nominee as well as the vanquished Sen. Bernie Sanders. The draft included language opposing the death penalty and calling for new legislation similar to the Glass-Steagall Wall Street reform Act. Maya, who worked alongside Sanders’ policy director Warren Gunnels, at the time called it “the most ambitious and progressive platform our party has ever seen.”

Reflecting on internal Clinton policy discussions, Moore said Maya would often raise the possibility of unintended consequences when a particular position was floated as the obvious choice.

“Sometimes that wreaks havoc and people don’t like it. People don’t want to be questioned,” she added of her friend. “But her unique combination of being a lawyer, a policy wonk, and understanding politics causes her to be a lot more layered than people give her credit for.”

Maya has had a hand in every facet of the campaign’s ramp-up, both behind the scenes and on the trail. On the fundraising front, she’s focused on New York-area donors in the African-American and Indian-American communities, with an eye on engaging what political fundraisers call “new-prospect” targets who weren’t previously active.

She traveled to Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia ahead of Kamala’s trips to New Orleans and Atlanta, meeting state Rep. Erick Allen before he threw his support behind Kamala at a stop in Atlanta. And Maya is in regular touch with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly women in the group.

Publicly, she’s often at the candidate’s side. At a soup dinner earlier this year in Iowa, Kamala walked one side of a long table shaking hands, answering questions and posing for pictures, while Maya paced the length of the other side doing the same. She appears in nearly every one of her sister’s stump speeches (“My sister Maya’s here,” Kamala will say) as a kind of narrative bridge to stories about their late mother, an Indian-born breast cancer researcher who friends attest instilled in her daughters a fierce loyalty and abiding bond.

“When you’re being raised by a single mom your sister is your best friend and confidant,” said Lateefah Simon, who was introduced to Maya by civil rights lawyer Eva Paterson, then went to work with Kamala before learning the two were related. Like Maya before her, Simon was a young mother, and she became like an auntie to her. When Maya was at the Ford Foundation, Simon said she got a no-B.S. reply to a poorly done grant application she had drafted.

“Don’t you ever send anything that is not perfect to this foundation,’” she recalled Maya telling her.

“Maya, like Kamala, she has a surgical precision of management,” Simon said. “She is absolutely not easy on the people that work for her, especially young black women. She wants them to do their best. She demands perfection from them.”

Simon remembers seeing the intensely private sisters in their downtime, in one moment laughing hysterically, and in the next their foreheads touching as they strategized. A years-old interview of the two talking together, which was posted online, underscores their sibling dynamic.

In the clip, they joke about how Maya refers to Kamala, then the attorney general of California, a title that’s sometimes shortened to “AG,” or “general.” Until she’s president of the United States, Maya says, “she’s just Kamala.” Kamala interjects, swatting aside what she seemed to view as a ludicrous suggestion at the time.

“No, I’m ‘big sister,’ Kamala says, pausing before landing her punchline—‘Big sister ‘general!’”

They break out in laughter.

“Maya is not going to sugarcoat Kamala,” Simon said. “But running for president of the United States as a black woman is almost unprecedented. You can’t buy that kind of loyalty, the kind of confidant who is also your best friend.”

“Maya was the one that was always asking the tough questions even when Hillary was embracing issues that would make you go, ‘Huh, OK,’” Moore said, keying on the adviser’s skill in framing complex issues. “Maya is not the type of person that is going to pull you left. She is going to pull you to the right position.”

“Hillary loved her. She loved her,” she added.

Maya, who declined to be interviewed for this story, later headed up Clinton’s platform committee, a group comprised of people aligned with the 2016 Democratic nominee as well as the vanquished Sen. Bernie Sanders. The draft included language opposing the death penalty and calling for new legislation similar to the Glass-Steagall Wall Street reform Act. Maya, who worked alongside Sanders’ policy director Warren Gunnels, at the time called it “the most ambitious and progressive platform our party has ever seen.”

Reflecting on internal Clinton policy discussions, Moore said Maya would often raise the possibility of unintended consequences when a particular position was floated as the obvious choice.

“Sometimes that wreaks havoc and people don’t like it. People don’t want to be questioned,” she added of her friend. “But her unique combination of being a lawyer, a policy wonk, and understanding politics causes her to be a lot more layered than people give her credit for.”

Maya has had a hand in every facet of the campaign’s ramp-up, both behind the scenes and on the trail. On the fundraising front, she’s focused on New York-area donors in the African-American and Indian-American communities, with an eye on engaging what political fundraisers call “new-prospect” targets who weren’t previously active.

She traveled to Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia ahead of Kamala’s trips to New Orleans and Atlanta, meeting state Rep. Erick Allen before he threw his support behind Kamala at a stop in Atlanta. And Maya is in regular touch with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly women in the group.

Publicly, she’s often at the candidate’s side. At a soup dinner earlier this year in Iowa, Kamala walked one side of a long table shaking hands, answering questions and posing for pictures, while Maya paced the length of the other side doing the same. She appears in nearly every one of her sister’s stump speeches (“My sister Maya’s here,” Kamala will say) as a kind of narrative bridge to stories about their late mother, an Indian-born breast cancer researcher who friends attest instilled in her daughters a fierce loyalty and abiding bond.

“When you’re being raised by a single mom your sister is your best friend and confidant,” said Lateefah Simon, who was introduced to Maya by civil rights lawyer Eva Paterson, then went to work with Kamala before learning the two were related. Like Maya before her, Simon was a young mother, and she became like an auntie to her. When Maya was at the Ford Foundation, Simon said she got a no-B.S. reply to a poorly done grant application she had drafted.

“Don’t you ever send anything that is not perfect to this foundation,’” she recalled Maya telling her.

“Maya, like Kamala, she has a surgical precision of management,” Simon said. “She is absolutely not easy on the people that work for her, especially young black women. She wants them to do their best. She demands perfection from them.”

Simon remembers seeing the intensely private sisters in their downtime, in one moment laughing hysterically, and in the next their foreheads touching as they strategized. A years-old interview of the two talking together, which was posted online, underscores their sibling dynamic.

In the clip, they joke about how Maya refers to Kamala, then the attorney general of California, a title that’s sometimes shortened to “AG,” or “general.” Until she’s president of the United States, Maya says, “she’s just Kamala.” Kamala interjects, swatting aside what she seemed to view as a ludicrous suggestion at the time.

“No, I’m ‘big sister,’ Kamala says, pausing before landing her punchline—‘Big sister ‘general!’”

They break out in laughter.

“Maya is not going to sugarcoat Kamala,” Simon said. “But running for president of the United States as a black woman is almost unprecedented. You can’t buy that kind of loyalty, the kind of confidant who is also your best friend.”

Kamala Harris’ campaign held a pair of intimate fundraisers last week in New York and Connecticut, where two dozen or so guests gathered at each event to hear the headliner offer a glimpse of the inner sanctum.

The featured guest, however, was not the candidate; Kamala didn’t attend. It was Maya Harris, her campaign chair and younger sister.

Story Continued Below

Since launching her White House bid, no figure in Kamala Harris’ orbit has loomed so large. A regular presence on the trail, Maya has been involved in virtually every facet of the race, from soliciting donors and recruiting the most diverse staff of any Democratic hopeful, to helping draft policy and talking up early state politicos.

A no-nonsense boss who became a single mom at 17 and earned a law degree from Stanford before embarking on a long career in progressive activism, she’s emerged as a primary attraction in her own right. Aside from standing in for Kamala at fundraisers, Maya can be seen at campaign stops posing for pictures with selfie seekers who recognize her from social media and her time as an MSNBC talking head — a gig she landed after advising Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

Maya is often the first point of contact for her sister in early states, where officials and operatives said she frequently touches base to gauge the lay of the land. In South Carolina, Marguerite Willis said she was eager to meet Maya because she speaks with authority for the candidate. Willis’ own sister was the No. 2 in her campaign for governor last year.

“It’s as close in the world to having a double as it gets,” Willis said of Maya.

Willis reached out to Maya on Twitter, and they met in Columbia, S.C. She ended up endorsing Kamala, as did several others who first connected with her sister: Willis’ running-mate, state Sen. John Scott, and Constance Anastopoulo, a past nominee for state attorney general.

On a recent swing though South Carolina, Maya broke away from the trail to lead a call with women's health organizations on Kamala’s newly released abortion plan.

“If Kamala Harris isn’t part of it, it’s Maya Harris,” said Juan Rodriguez, Kamala’s campaign manager. “Our constant job is finding out where she can help us expand our bandwidth.”

Political families have long been a public fixation, with spouses and siblings filling official and unofficial roles, from confidant to security blanket and everything in between. But the fascination seems to have reached new heights in the Trump era: The president has appointed his relatives to posts they probably wouldn’t have landed if not for their ties to him.

Maya, who headed up the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California on her way to becoming a well-known civil rights advocate, is a different story. The 52-year-old — who holds the post that John Podesta had for the Clinton campaign, and has been aspirationally referred to by political types as Kamala’s Bobby Kennedy — would almost certainly be serving in a Clinton administration had she won.

“Everyone is used to relatives that are doofuses,” said Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, who brought in Maya as a senior fellow in 2013. There, she authored a prescient paper on politics titled, “Women of Color: A Growing Force in the American Electorate.”

“When you have a relative that is competent and capable, what does that mean?” Tanden asked.

Maya’s close relationship with her older sister hasn’t shielded her from internal disputes about the direction and message of the campaign. Kamala fosters an environment of creative tension that aides describe as part-Socratic method, part mock court. Aides on opposite sides of an issue present their case — backed up by research, because anything less is dismissed — and the former prosecutor acts as judge.

Maya, according to campaign sources, is acutely aware of the liabilities that her sister’s law enforcement record poses with Democratic voters who’ve moved left on criminal justice reform. She’s given voice internally to those concerns — and how to address them politically — while serving as a conduit to activists on the outside with hesitations about Kamala.

The candidate herself has shown sensitivity about her record, including on school truancy and independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. As her campaign has unfolded, she’s offered more nuanced — and at times contradictory — stances than she did as California’s top law enforcement official.

But in backing away from her past, some aides and advisers believe she risks weakening her main argument: that she has the backbone to take the fight to Trump. Along with Maya, family input comes from her husband, Doug Emhoff, and Maya’s spouse, Tony West, chief legal officer at Uber and the Justice Department’s third-ranking official under President Barack Obama.

“Family members — if used right — can play a big role,” said a Kamala confidant familiar with her campaign’s dynamics. The person added that campaign aides have used family members to deliver messages that Kamala wasn’t immediately receptive to. “It’s a matter of utilizing them strategically and in spots where it makes the most sense — and not as the center-point of campaign strategy.”

Kamala declined to address a question about the advice she’s receiving. Asked about Maya’s role in the campaign, Kamala leafed through her sister’s resume—from her time, at age 29, as one of the youngest law school deans in the country to being a vice president at the Ford Foundation, where she worked on social justice and democracy issues.

“I think most people who know Maya will tell you she’s one of the smartest people they know,” Kamala said. “The fact that she has volunteered to work on this campaign at such a high level, and she’s exactly who she’s always been—she works around the clock and she’s probably the hardest, if not one of the hardest working people on the campaign—I feel very blessed.”

Maya’s own “radical, left-wing politics,” as one friend affectionately put it, appears in her work and through an extensive contact list that’s outside her sister’s sphere: “She has activists, radicals and revolutionaries on her speed dial,” the friend said.

At PolicyLink, which advocates for racial and economic equity, Maya wrote about community-centered policing practices and was the lead author of an activist’s guide to police reform. She helped edit manuscripts of the New York Times bestseller “The New Jim Crow,” by legal scholar Michelle Alexander, which argued that ""we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.""

Yet it was her policy work for Clinton that transformed Maya into a major player in electoral politics. She won Clinton’s trust by taking on difficult issues around criminal justice reform, recalled Minyon Moore, a senior adviser to the 2016 campaign. Moore insists Maya is not an ideologue despite her progressive beliefs.

“Maya was the one that was always asking the tough questions even when Hillary was embracing issues that would make you go, ‘Huh, OK,’” Moore said, keying on the adviser’s skill in framing complex issues. “Maya is not the type of person that is going to pull you left.

160,Trump’s high-wire act on trade risks a rough fall,Ben White,"Economists warn that if President Donald Trump can’t pull off deals with China and Mexico, his high-wire act could lead to disaster. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo white house Trump’s high-wire act on trade risks a rough fall The president is counting on a strong economy to cushion the U.S. during his tariff fight. But economists say conditions are already fragile — raising recession risks just before his 2020 reelection race.

Donald Trump is trying to pull off the riskiest high-wire act of his presidency, threatening to escalate trade battles with Mexico and China even as warnings signals flash about a possible recession arriving just as his re-election campaign begins.

Trump is edging to the brink of a two-front trade war in a very different environment than he enjoyed last year, when the GOP tax cut pumped billions of dollars of stimulus into the U.S. economy.

Story Continued Below

Analysts now expect economic growth to slow closer to a 2 percent pace this year. And investors, Wall Street analysts and the Federal Reserve are signaling that if Trump doesn’t make quick deals, growth could stall out completely.

“If you combine the effects of Mexico and China tariffs, the drag on the economy is close to 1.5 percent and that is quite significant when you consider that growth is already slowing quite a lot,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “And who knows about the confidence shock from tariffs or the stock-market shock. The risk here would clearly be recession if we are talking about these blanket tariffs.”

Signals on the direction of the U.S. economy remain mixed. A reading on private payrolls in May showed the smallest gain since 2010. But the official government employment gauge out Friday morning is expected to be better and unemployment remains historically low.

But the stock market tanked in May as investors worried about the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Shares jumped Thursday afternoon on reports that the Mexico tariffs could be delayed and that a deal could still be reached before the first levies of 5 percent go into effect on Monday.

In the bond market, investors now receive less interest on long-term than short-term bonds, a wonky but critical phenomenon known as an “inverted yield curve” that often precedes recessions. Oil prices officially entered bear market territory this week — a drop of 20 percent from a recent high — on fears that a slowdown in global growth will slice into demand. Low oil prices are good for consumer spending in a strong economy but can also signal an impending contraction due to weak demand.

Virtually every major economic forecasting firm now has growth downshifting to just below 2 percent in the second quarter of the year as the impact of the tax cut fades and a build up of inventories that boosted first-quarter GDP over 3 percent gets unwound.

The shock of tariffs as high as 25 percent on $350 billion in Mexican imports and over $500 billion in Chinese imports — coupled with negative reaction in markets — could push that number close to or below zero, analysts warn.

And the mere fact that Trump threatened the Mexican tariffs over an unrelated immigration matter and after negotiating a sweeping free-trade deal with Mexico could undermine the confidence of corporate executives to make investments and consumers to trust that the economy will remain strong.

“We are already fragile on sentiment,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Consumer confidence is still high but expectations for the future are now below a gauge of current conditions, she noted. That means consumers still feel good now but are getting worried about the outlook, suggesting potential for a spending pullback.

Swonk sees a recession coming in 2020 unless the trade fights come to a rapid end. “We literally scared ourselves into a sharp market pullback last year in a stronger economy. Now we are doing all this in a weaker economy and it ups the risk that we fall straight through the ice,” she said.

Recession fears are showing up most sharply in the bond market, where an inverted yield curve presaged every recent recession. Ordinarily, investors demand more interest to lock up their money in longer-term Treasury bonds. But when investors get nervous that markets and the economy could be vulnerable, they tend to gravitate to long-term bonds, sending prices higher and yields lower.

“This is not normal and it tells us something is wrong,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University’s business school who wrote his thesis on yield curve inversions and has tracked them for three decades. “What we’ve observed in the data is that if you’ve got an inversion of the 10-year bond against the 3-month bill for one full quarter, that has predicted each of the last seven recessions and provided no false signals.” This part of the yield curve has been inverted for nearly a full quarter.

The inverted yield curve, jittery markets and the threat of further destabilizing trade actions have clearly caught the attention of the Federal Reserve. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking Tuesday in Chicago, sent stocks sharply higher when he indicated the central bank would be “closely monitoring” the trade disputes and would “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.”

Wall Street traders now expect the Fed to cut rates as many as three times this year to battle the inverted yield curve and cushion the blow from trade wars. The problem here is the Fed has a fairly long tradition of cutting rates too late. Economists note that the Fed cut rates too late in 2008 when the housing market collapsed and in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst. Rate cuts also take time to have an impact, meaning by the time the central banks gets around to acting this summer or fall, the next downturn could already be gathering pace.

“Sometimes the Fed should worry that overly easy policy will lead to complacency in financial markets,” former Treasury secretary Larry Summers wrote in an op-ed this week. “In light of recent volatility in the markets and with the possibility of more adverse surprises on the trade front, this is not such a time.”

Trump, meanwhile, continues to argue that the economy is doing extraordinarily well and that tariffs are a net positive. “The higher the tariffs go, the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!,” the president tweeted Wednesday.

Inside the administration, aides including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have largely given up on the idea that they can talk Trump out of the Mexico tariffs.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday rejected early reports that the president might hold off. “Position has not changed, and we are still moving forward with tariffs at this time,” she said.

Economists take a very different view of the likely impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexico, particularly on the auto industry, which relies on an integrated North American supply chain and often sends parts and completed vehicles across the border several times before they reach the market, leading to the potential for compounding tariffs.

Deutsche Bank estimates that tariffs of 25 percent could increase the cost of vehicles in the U.S. by an average of $1,300 and reduce demand by 3 million units, or 18 percent.

Economists also warn that Trump going to 25 percent on everything China exports to the U.S. will quickly lead to higher prices for consumers.

Trump has repeatedly claimed that foreign countries pay the tariffs he levies, leading to more revenue for the Treasury. But academic research thus far shows nearly all the cost has been borne by U.S. importers and consumers.

That’s what leads economists to warn that if Trump can’t pull off deals with China and Mexico, his high-wire act could lead to disaster.

“It’s one thing to impose tariffs when the economy is on the way up and we are doing fine,” said Daco. “But once you’ve reached the inflection point, and we’ve passed that point, then any push you give with tariffs is just going to make the slowdown more rampant and throw fuel on the fire.”","Economists warn that if President Donald Trump can’t pull off deals with China and Mexico, his high-wire act could lead to disaster.

Donald Trump is trying to pull off the riskiest high-wire act of his presidency, threatening to escalate trade battles with Mexico and China even as warnings signals flash about a possible recession arriving just as his re-election campaign begins.

Trump is edging to the brink of a two-front trade war in a very different environment than he enjoyed last year, when the GOP tax cut pumped billions of dollars of stimulus into the U.S. economy.

Analysts now expect economic growth to slow closer to a 2 percent pace this year. And investors, Wall Street analysts and the Federal Reserve are signaling that if Trump doesn’t make quick deals, growth could stall out completely.

“If you combine the effects of Mexico and China tariffs, the drag on the economy is close to 1.5 percent and that is quite significant when you consider that growth is already slowing quite a lot,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “And who knows about the confidence shock from tariffs or the stock-market shock. The risk here would clearly be recession if we are talking about these blanket tariffs.”

Signals on the direction of the U.S. economy remain mixed. A reading on private payrolls in May showed the smallest gain since 2010. But the official government employment gauge out Friday morning is expected to be better and unemployment remains historically low.

But the stock market tanked in May as investors worried about the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Shares jumped Thursday afternoon on reports that the Mexico tariffs could be delayed and that a deal could still be reached before the first levies of 5 percent go into effect on Monday.

In the bond market, investors now receive less interest on long-term than short-term bonds, a wonky but critical phenomenon known as an “inverted yield curve” that often precedes recessions. Oil prices officially entered bear market territory this week — a drop of 20 percent from a recent high — on fears that a slowdown in global growth will slice into demand. Low oil prices are good for consumer spending in a strong economy but can also signal an impending contraction due to weak demand.

Virtually every major economic forecasting firm now has growth downshifting to just below 2 percent in the second quarter of the year as the impact of the tax cut fades and a build up of inventories that boosted first-quarter GDP over 3 percent gets unwound.

The shock of tariffs as high as 25 percent on $350 billion in Mexican imports and over $500 billion in Chinese imports — coupled with negative reaction in markets — could push that number close to or below zero, analysts warn.

And the mere fact that Trump threatened the Mexican tariffs over an unrelated immigration matter and after negotiating a sweeping free-trade deal with Mexico could undermine the confidence of corporate executives to make investments and consumers to trust that the economy will remain strong.

“We are already fragile on sentiment,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Consumer confidence is still high but expectations for the future are now below a gauge of current conditions, she noted. That means consumers still feel good now but are getting worried about the outlook, suggesting potential for a spending pullback.

164,How a renegade Chinese billionaire became a center of D.C. intrigue,Ben Schreckinger,"The details of a suit tied to Guo Wengui, which is being waged in federal court in the Southern District of New York, read more like a spy novel than a dry legal document. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images legal How a renegade Chinese billionaire became a center of D.C. intrigue Guo Wengui allegedly offered a pair of conservative operatives $9 million for dirt on his enemies’ porn habits and out-of-wedlock children. Now he’s suing.

A billionaire at the center of U.S.-China tensions is waging a mysterious legal battle against two D.C. conservatives over a private espionage deal gone bad. The fight touches on a pair of think tanks, a senator’s widow and the capital’s tight-knit group of China hardliners, adding a new chapter to an international saga that has divided the Trump administration and the president’s external allies.

It began when a firm tied to the billionaire, real estate magnate Guo Wengui, allegedly hired a private intelligence firm to dig up dirt on Chinese nationals — including their bank records, porn habits and any illegitimate children — then sued, saying the firm failed to deliver. In turn, the intelligence firm has claimed Guo’s side gave it a thumb drive loaded with sophisticated malware and that he sought information on people whose records were deemed sensitive by the U.S. government.

Story Continued Below

The ongoing suit, the details of which are reported here for the first time, deepens the already considerable mystique surrounding the billionaire businessman. An ally of Steve Bannon’s and a fugitive from Chinese authorities, Guo now lives in New York. His presence in the U.S. has exacerbated tensions between China’s ruling Communist Party and the administration of President Donald Trump.

The case also offers a rare behind-the-curtain glimpse at the tactics of 21st century geopolitical intrigue, where it is increasingly common for deep-pocketed clients with political agendas to pay firms with government contacts and cyber know-how to obtain people’s sensitive private information — and then use it to destroy them.



***

The details of the suit, which is being waged in federal court in the Southern District of New York, read more like a spy novel than a dry legal document.

Guo, who goes by Miles Kwok in the U.S., built a sizable fortune in real estate in China before apparently running afoul of the country’s government and fleeing in 2014. A year later, he came to the U.S., where he is seeking asylum while he lives in an opulent Manhattan apartment and publicizes claims of corruption against Chinese government officials. Since Guo fled to the U.S., the Chinese government has accused him of a raft of crimes, and a former assistant has accused him of rape. Guo has denied the allegations against him, calling them politically motivated.

In early 2018, the Guo-linked firm hired Strategic Vision, an obscure company led by Washington-area executive French Wallop, to dig up information on several targets, whom the suit does not name.

According to a court filing by Wallop’s firm, Guo enlisted it, ""To perform research and analytics on numerous Chinese Nationals whom Mr. Guo and his undisclosed Chinese associates suspected to be engaged in activities in the United States and elsewhere that are inconsistent with their standing in the Chinese Communist Party and/or the laws of the United States.""

Wallop was the third wife of Malcolm Wallop, the late Republican senator from Wyoming. In recent years, she has maintained a low profile in Washington, though in the midst of her divorce from the senator in 2000, the Washington Post’s gossip columnist obtained a sharply worded change-of-address note she sent around to friends stating, “French Wallop regrets to inform you that due to a significant indiscretion on the part of her husband of 16 years, he may now be reached at the following address.” On her LinkedIn profile, Wallop refers to Strategic Vision as a “strategic consulting firm.”

In addition to Wallop, J. Michael Waller acted as a representative of Strategic Vision, according to a letter the firm submitted to the court. Waller is a vice president at the far-right Center for Security Policy, a think tank founded by Frank Gaffney, a national security activist known for his conspiratorial hostility to Islam. Waller also served as the ghostwriter for the memoirs of Blackwater founder Erik Prince, according to his website.

By late 2017, when Guo was allegedly arranging for the contract, he also became something of a political football as Beijing sought his return to China. Earlier that year, China issued an Interpol red notice for his arrest. Then Chinese officials traveling to the U.S. on transit visas, which did not permit them to conduct government business, visited Guo at his apartment. This prompted a standoff, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, between the Justice Department, which wanted to arrest the Chinese officials, and the State Department, which successfully held the DOJ at bay.

Casino magnate Steve Wynn, a longtime Trump confidant with business interests in China, reportedly hand-delivered the president a letter from the Chinese government requesting Guo’s handover, though Wynn’s firm has denied it. Guo’s fate became a subject of heated internal debate within the administration, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly threatened to resign if the renegade mogul was turned over to China.

According to one person who knows the people involved, it was in the context of this battle over his fate that Guo sought dirt on Chinese nationals: He wanted, this person said, to ingratiate himself with U.S. authorities by offering them intelligence, financed from his own fortune, in a bid to show he could be useful.

In January 2018, a Hong Kong firm tied to Guo, Eastern Profit, inked a contract with Strategic Vision US. It is rare for the details of private espionage agreements to see the light of day, but Strategic Vision attached its five-page agreement as an exhibit to a counterclaim it lodged in response to the suit. The contract promises $9 million in exchange for a year’s worth of snooping on 10 unnamed individuals — referred to in the document as “fish” — calling for details on everything from their movements to financial records to sensitive personal information. That includes details on a “subject's family, extramarital affairs, children born out of wedlock” as well as their “pornography” and their use of “‘dating’ or sexual services apps.”

According to the Guo-linked firm’s complaint, Strategic Vision said it had a former NSA agent on staff and said it had worked “for Republican politicians, a Middle Eastern prince and a politician belonging to the opposition party in Russia.” Guo’s side also alleged that Strategic Vision provided a “sample report, which appeared to show that Strategic Vision could enter into banking systems and find evidence of money laundering.” But, the complaint alleges, after Guo advanced Strategic Vision an initial $1 million payment, it discovered the firm did not have the capabilities it claimed.

Not long after, Eastern Profit sued Strategic Vision. The case remained under seal for several months, keeping it from public view. Though much of the court record has now been unsealed, parts of the case remain under a protective order that prevents sensitive details from being revealed.

In a countersuit, Strategic Vision accused Guo and his representatives of a variety of troubling actions. The firm, which denied most of Eastern Profit’s allegations, claimed that when a representative of Guo’s provided a thumb drive with information on his chosen surveillance targets — Chinese officials whom Guo allegedly suspected of wrongdoing — the thumb drive turned out to be loaded with sophisticated malware. After the firm complained, it says it received three new thumb drives from Guo’s side, one of which also contained malware.

According to the counter-claim, which has been dismissed without prejudice, Guo was introduced to Strategic Vision by Lianchao Han, a dissident activist and visiting fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. But, it alleges, Guo later told the firm that Han could not be trusted. Instead, Guo allegedly told the firm to communicate with his assistant, whom Guo “oddly advised was a member of the Chinese Communist Party who also could not be trusted.” Han did not respond to requests for comment.

The firm also alleged that, when it began researching its targets, it discovered they “had been designated by the U.S. Department of State under the Obama administration as ‘Records Protected’ persons, meaning that information concerning their status and activities was not subject to disclosure under any circumstances. Strategic Vision learned that attempting to research subjects known to be 'Records Protected' could be a criminal activity.""

It is not clear to what exactly the “Records Protected” designation refers. The State Department did not respond to questions about the term, and several former top legal advisers at State said they were not familiar with it.

“I have never heard of a State Department ‘records protected’ designation per se,” wrote Brian Egan, a partner at the law firm Steptoe who served as the department’s top legal adviser at the end of Barack Obama’s administration. “I am also having a hard time imagining a circumstance in which a private person or company could be prosecuted for merely attempting to research information about a particular individual.”

A lawyer for Eastern Profit, Zachary Grendi, forwarded a request for comment to Daniel Podhaskie, a lawyer for Guo’s family office, who declined to comment. A lawyer for Strategic Vision, Mark Berube, did not respond to requests for comment. Waller declined to comment on the record.

The circumstances of the lawsuit are just one of the many mysteries swirling around Guo. Many basic details of his biography, including his exact age, remain hazy.

He was born roughly 50 years ago, reportedly in the coastal Shandong Province in Eastern China — or, he has claimed, in Jilin Province in the country’s north — and made a fortune in real estate, benefiting from the construction boom around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. There, he developed a reputation for playing hardball. After clashing with a deputy mayor of Beijing, Guo gave the police a video of the official having sex with his mistress, prompting the man’s arrest and political downfall.

Guo appears to owe his rise in part to his relationship with a top official at China’s Ministry of State Security. The official, former vice minister Ma Jian, fell out of favor and was arrested in early 2015 on corruption charges. Two months later, the Chinese outlet Caixin published an expose of Guo, highlighting his ties to the toppled intelligence official.

By that point, Guo had already fled China.

Since arriving in the U.S., Guo has constantly irritated the ruling party, spouting a steady stream of salacious allegations about corruption and other official wrongdoing.

Ensconced in New York, the renegade businessman set up Guo Media to amplify his campaign against the Communist Party and often dispenses his accusations via video livestream while going about his billionaire lifestyle — including from the deck of his $20 million yacht.

Guo accused China’s top anti-corruption official, Wang Qishan, of corruption and of having an affair with a famous actress, Fan Bingbing, whose temporary disappearance became an international mystery of its own last year. He also offered his own theory on the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, claiming the CCP brought down the Beijing-bound plane to get rid of people who could have blown the whistle on an organ-harvesting scheme in Nanjing.

Guo’s bombastic style and real estate background have prompted comparisons to Trump.

He is even a member of Mar-a-Lago, prompting concerns that he might attempt to show up at the club during Xi’s first summit with Trump in the spring of 2017 and cause some sort of international incident.

“I like because Donald Trump the president talks [about] fake news. This idea is really good,” Guo, whose English is rudimentary, told Vice News. “Everything [said] about me is fake.”

One thing about Guo is clear: Since arriving in the U.S., he has embraced the country’s litigious culture. In addition to the private spying case, he is embroiled in several ongoing legal fights, including a dispute with his former attorneys at Boies Schiller Flexner, the firm founded by politically connected super lawyer David Boies. Guo also sued Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political adviser, last year for $100 million after Stone claimed the billionaire had illegally donated to Hillary Clinton and was funding a presidential run by Bannon. In December, Stone retracted his statements and apologized.

Guo’s lawsuit against Strategic Vision could prove awkward for Washington’s small community of China hardliners.

In March, several prominent China hawks launched Committee on the Present Danger, a new conservative advocacy group aimed at encouraging U.S. confrontation with China. The group, which includes former CIA director Jim Woolsey, has held events in New York and Washington, including an April roundtable on Capitol Hill that featured Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

While members of the committee are united on China, they are divided on Guo.

Both Waller, who is fighting Guo, and Bannon, the billionaire’s closest ally in the U.S., are members of the committee. The group also includes Gaffney, whose think tank employs Waller, and Han, who introduced Guo to Strategic Vision, only to have Guo allegedly turn around and badmouth Han as untrustworthy.

But as the dispute winds its way through court, the committee is presenting a united front. Gaffney said he was not aware of any internal strife the suit had caused within the group.

Bannon declined to comment on the record. He maintains warm relations with Guo, whom he calls “Miles” and has met with dozens of times. The lawsuit has done nothing to slow the pair’s crusade against Beijing.

In recent days, what appears to be the Twitter account for Guo Media has repeatedly posted a photo of Bannon and Guo hugging each other as well as a photo of Bannon photoshopped to show him aiming a double-barreled pistol with flames behind him in the background.

On Sunday, Guo Media’s YouTube page posted a video of a three-hour political discussion between Bannon and Guo, who sat together at a desk in front of a Chinese landscape painting.

""The Chinese people are being suppressed and enslaved,” Bannon, dressed all in black, declared.

Guo, in a tailored blue suit, smiled and gestured expressively. On an iPad, Guo showed Bannon messages he said came from Chinese citizens.

""All of these messages are to express love to Mr. Bannon,” Guo said. “They all tell you that they love you, Mr. Bannon.”

Despite his aggressive campaign against Beijing, Guo remains a puzzle to China-watchers, with some supporting his asylum hopes and others remaining suspicious of his motives.

A Times Magazine profile of Guo last year reported that some Chinese dissidents in New York suspect him of actually being a spy for Beijing.

Others say he has already proven useful to the U.S. “I’ve interviewed him, and he has sensitive knowledge of high-level Chinese Communist politics,” said MIchael Pillsbury, a fluent Mandarin speaker who spent decades as a China analyst in the federal government and now serves as a top outside adviser to Trump on the country. “I also don’t think he should be returned to China.”

As Trump and Xi head into an expected meeting later this month at the G-20 summit in Japan to hash out differences over trade policy, Guo remains in the background as a lingering wrinkle in U.S.-China relations — and a lingering mystery.","| Drew Angerer/Getty Images legal How a renegade Chinese billionaire became a center of D.C. intrigue Guo Wengui allegedly offered a pair of conservative operatives $9 million for dirt on his enemies’ porn habits and out-of-wedlock children.

A billionaire at the center of U.S.-China tensions is waging a mysterious legal battle against two D.C. conservatives over a private espionage deal gone bad. The fight touches on a pair of think tanks, a senator’s widow and the capital’s tight-knit group of China hardliners, adding a new chapter to an international saga that has divided the Trump administration and the president’s external allies.

It began when a firm tied to the billionaire, real estate magnate Guo Wengui, allegedly hired a private intelligence firm to dig up dirt on Chinese nationals — including their bank records, porn habits and any illegitimate children — then sued, saying the firm failed to deliver. In turn, the intelligence firm has claimed Guo’s side gave it a thumb drive loaded with sophisticated malware and that he sought information on people whose records were deemed sensitive by the U.S. government.

This prompted a standoff, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, between the Justice Department, which wanted to arrest the Chinese officials, and the State Department, which successfully held the DOJ at bay.

Casino magnate Steve Wynn, a longtime Trump confidant with business interests in China, reportedly hand-delivered the president a letter from the Chinese government requesting Guo’s handover, though Wynn’s firm has denied it. Guo’s fate became a subject of heated internal debate within the administration, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly threatened to resign if the renegade mogul was turned over to China.

According to one person who knows the people involved, it was in the context of this battle over his fate that Guo sought dirt on Chinese nationals: He wanted, this person said, to ingratiate himself with U.S. authorities by offering them intelligence, financed from his own fortune, in a bid to show he could be useful.

In January 2018, a Hong Kong firm tied to Guo, Eastern Profit, inked a contract with Strategic Vision US. It is rare for the details of private espionage agreements to see the light of day, but Strategic Vision attached its five-page agreement as an exhibit to a counterclaim it lodged in response to the suit. The contract promises $9 million in exchange for a year’s worth of snooping on 10 unnamed individuals — referred to in the document as “fish” — calling for details on everything from their movements to financial records to sensitive personal information. That includes details on a “subject's family, extramarital affairs, children born out of wedlock” as well as their “pornography” and their use of “‘dating’ or sexual services apps.”

According to the Guo-linked firm’s complaint, Strategic Vision said it had a former NSA agent on staff and said it had worked “for Republican politicians, a Middle Eastern prince and a politician belonging to the opposition party in Russia.” Guo’s side also alleged that Strategic Vision provided a “sample report, which appeared to show that Strategic Vision could enter into banking systems and find evidence of money laundering.” But, the complaint alleges, after Guo advanced Strategic Vision an initial $1 million payment, it discovered the firm did not have the capabilities it claimed.

Not long after, Eastern Profit sued Strategic Vision. The case remained under seal for several months, keeping it from public view. Though much of the court record has now been unsealed, parts of the case remain under a protective order that prevents sensitive details from being revealed.

In a countersuit, Strategic Vision accused Guo and his representatives of a variety of troubling actions. The firm, which denied most of Eastern Profit’s allegations, claimed that when a representative of Guo’s provided a thumb drive with information on his chosen surveillance targets — Chinese officials whom Guo allegedly suspected of wrongdoing — the thumb drive turned out to be loaded with sophisticated malware. After the firm complained, it says it received three new thumb drives from Guo’s side, one of which also contained malware.

According to the counter-claim, which has been dismissed without prejudice, Guo was introduced to Strategic Vision by Lianchao Han, a dissident activist and visiting fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. But, it alleges, Guo later told the firm that Han could not be trusted. Instead, Guo allegedly told the firm to communicate with his assistant, whom Guo “oddly advised was a member of the Chinese Communist Party who also could not be trusted.” Han did not respond to requests for comment.

The firm also alleged that, when it began researching its targets, it discovered they “had been designated by the U.S. Department of State under the Obama administration as ‘Records Protected’ persons, meaning that information concerning their status and activities was not subject to disclosure under any circumstances. Strategic Vision learned that attempting to research subjects known to be 'Records Protected' could be a criminal activity.""

It is not clear to what exactly the “Records Protected” designation refers. The State Department did not respond to questions about the term, and several former top legal advisers at State said they were not familiar with it.

“I have never heard of a State Department ‘records protected’ designation per se,” wrote Brian Egan, a partner at the law firm Steptoe who served as the department’s top legal adviser at the end of Barack Obama’s administration. “I am also having a hard time imagining a circumstance in which a private person or company could be prosecuted for merely attempting to research information about a particular individual.”

A lawyer for Eastern Profit, Zachary Grendi, forwarded a request for comment to Daniel Podhaskie, a lawyer for Guo’s family office, who declined to comment. A lawyer for Strategic Vision, Mark Berube, did not respond to requests for comment. Waller declined to comment on the record.

The circumstances of the lawsuit are just one of the many mysteries swirling around Guo. Many basic details of his biography, including his exact age, remain hazy.

He was born roughly 50 years ago, reportedly in the coastal Shandong Province in Eastern China — or, he has claimed, in Jilin Province in the country’s north — and made a fortune in real estate, benefiting from the construction boom around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. There, he developed a reputation for playing hardball. After clashing with a deputy mayor of Beijing, Guo gave the police a video of the official having sex with his mistress, prompting the man’s arrest and political downfall.

Guo appears to owe his rise in part to his relationship with a top official at China’s Ministry of State Security. The official, former vice minister Ma Jian, fell out of favor and was arrested in early 2015 on corruption charges. Two months later, the Chinese outlet Caixin published an expose of Guo, highlighting his ties to the toppled intelligence official.

By that point, Guo had already fled China.

Since arriving in the U.S., Guo has constantly irritated the ruling party, spouting a steady stream of salacious allegations about corruption and other official wrongdoing.

Ensconced in New York, the renegade businessman set up Guo Media to amplify his campaign against the Communist Party and often dispenses his accusations via video livestream while going about his billionaire lifestyle — including from the deck of his $20 million yacht.

Guo accused China’s top anti-corruption official, Wang Qishan, of corruption and of having an affair with a famous actress, Fan Bingbing, whose temporary disappearance became an international mystery of its own last year. He also offered his own theory on the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, claiming the CCP brought down the Beijing-bound plane to get rid of people who could have blown the whistle on an organ-harvesting scheme in Nanjing.

Guo’s bombastic style and real estate background have prompted comparisons to Trump.

He is even a member of Mar-a-Lago, prompting concerns that he might attempt to show up at the club during Xi’s first summit with Trump in the spring of 2017 and cause some sort of international incident.

“I like because Donald Trump the president talks [about] fake news. This idea is really good,” Guo, whose English is rudimentary, told Vice News. “Everything [said] about me is fake.”

One thing about Guo is clear: Since arriving in the U.S., he has embraced the country’s litigious culture. In addition to the private spying case, he is embroiled in several ongoing legal fights, including a dispute with his former attorneys at Boies Schiller Flexner, the firm founded by politically connected super lawyer David Boies. Guo also sued Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political adviser, last year for $100 million after Stone claimed the billionaire had illegally donated to Hillary Clinton and was funding a presidential run by Bannon. In December, Stone retracted his statements and apologized.

Guo’s lawsuit against Strategic Vision could prove awkward for Washington’s small community of China hardliners.

In March, several prominent China hawks launched Committee on the Present Danger, a new conservative advocacy group aimed at encouraging U.S. confrontation with China. The group, which includes former CIA director Jim Woolsey, has held events in New York and Washington, including an April roundtable on Capitol Hill that featured Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

While members of the committee are united on China, they are divided on Guo.

Both Waller, who is fighting Guo, and Bannon, the billionaire’s closest ally in the U.S., are members of the committee. The group also includes Gaffney, whose think tank employs Waller, and Han, who introduced Guo to Strategic Vision, only to have Guo allegedly turn around and badmouth Han as untrustworthy.

But as the dispute winds its way through court, the committee is presenting a united front. Gaffney said he was not aware of any internal strife the suit had caused within the group.

Bannon declined to comment on the record. He maintains warm relations with Guo, whom he calls “Miles” and has met with dozens of times. The lawsuit has done nothing to slow the pair’s crusade against Beijing.

In recent days, what appears to be the Twitter account for Guo Media has repeatedly posted a photo of Bannon and Guo hugging each other as well as a photo of Bannon photoshopped to show him aiming a double-barreled pistol with flames behind him in the background.

On Sunday, Guo Media’s YouTube page posted a video of a three-hour political discussion between Bannon and Guo, who sat together at a desk in front of a Chinese landscape painting.

""The Chinese people are being suppressed and enslaved,” Bannon, dressed all in black, declared.

Guo, in a tailored blue suit, smiled and gestured expressively. On an iPad, Guo showed Bannon messages he said came from Chinese citizens.

""All of these messages are to express love to Mr. Bannon,” Guo said. “They all tell you that they love you, Mr. Bannon.”

Despite his aggressive campaign against Beijing, Guo remains a puzzle to China-watchers, with some supporting his asylum hopes and others remaining suspicious of his motives.

A Times Magazine profile of Guo last year reported that some Chinese dissidents in New York suspect him of actually being a spy for Beijing.

Others say he has already proven useful to the U.S. “I’ve interviewed him, and he has sensitive knowledge of high-level Chinese Communist politics,” said MIchael Pillsbury, a fluent Mandarin speaker who spent decades as a China analyst in the federal government and now serves as a top outside adviser to Trump on the country. “I also don’t think he should be returned to China.”

As Trump and Xi head into an expected meeting later this month at the G-20 summit in Japan to hash out differences over trade policy, Guo remains in the background as a lingering wrinkle in U.S.-China relations — and a lingering mystery.","| Drew Angerer/Getty Images legal How a renegade Chinese billionaire became a center of D.C. intrigue Guo Wengui allegedly offered a pair of conservative operatives $9 million for dirt on his enemies’ porn habits and out-of-wedlock children.

167,Biden reverses abortion funding stand,Marc Caputo,"Former Vice President Joe Biden changed his stance on public funding for abortions, saying he ""can’t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need."" | Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images 2020 elections Biden reverses abortion funding stand

Joe Biden on Thursday reversed his longstanding opposition to public funding of abortions, saying that the successful Republican nationwide “assault” on a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy forced him to change his mind.

The former vice president and current Democratic front-runner for president, said that his about-face during the election cycle came as GOP-controlled states this year began restricting the procedure and phasing out abortion clinics — a move that left women without access to a doctor to end their pregnancies.

Story Continued Below

He made the surprise announcement at the start of a speech during the Democratic National Committee’s gala in Atlanta, which was devoted more to voting rights and minority empowerment than abortion.

“I can’t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right,” Biden said Thursday. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s ZIP code.”

Biden, however, did indicate that he would not support taxpayer funding for abortion if it became more readily available for women in need, particularly women who live in poverty.

Biden’s reversal came as he began drawing significant political fire this week for saying he still supported what’s known as the Hyde Amendment, a federal spending provision that since 1976 has been annually approved to ban federal funding for most abortions, including for low-income women enrolled in Medicaid.

Earlier in the campaign, Biden had signaled he no longer supported the amendment.

Biden has long held one of the more conservative positions on abortion among latter-day Democrats. He once opposed efforts to add abortion exemptions for victims of rape or incest when he was a senator from Delaware. In 1981, he also voted for a constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to overturn Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in 1973.

“I have supported the Hyde Amendment like many, many others have,” Biden said Thursday, “because there were sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right — women of color, poor women, women who were not able to have access — and it was not under attack as it is now. But circumstances have changed.”

Biden said he changed his mind as he began hammering out his health care plan to provide universal health care coverage, “and I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents.”

But the biggest challenge, he said, were Republicans.

“Women’s rights and women’s health are under assault like we haven’t seen in the last 50 years,” he said. “It’s clear that these folks are going to stop at nothing to get rid of Roe. And it’s clear to me that we just have to be strong defending it. I support Roe. I support a woman’s right to choose … and quite frankly, I always will.”

Biden’s surprise announcement was quickly condemned as an election-year epiphany by his opponents on the right and left, but it was praised by the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, which said in a written statement that that it was “glad that Joe Biden listened to the voices of millions of women and further clarified his position on the Hyde Amendment.”

“Let’s be clear,” NARAL said, “the Hyde Amendment discriminates against all women but particularly poor women and women of color.”","Former Vice President Joe Biden changed his stance on public funding for abortions, saying he ""can’t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need.""

President Donald Trump on Thursday called Nancy Pelosi a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” in response to the House speaker telling lawmakers she wanted Trump to go to prison.

“I think she's a disgrace. I don't think she's a talented person,” Trump said of Pelosi. “I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She's incapable of doing deals. She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.”

POLITICO reported Wednesday that Pelosi said she wanted Trump to go to prison while pushing back on Democratic efforts to impeach the president, saying that she wants him defeated in 2020 and later charged for crimes.

Pelosi has frustrated some in her party for rebuffing calls for the president’s impeachment following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Pelosi’s allies have said impeachment would go nowhere with a Republican-controlled Senate.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” Pelosi said, while Trump was in Europe.

Pelosi’s comments were made behind closed doors and revealed to POLITICO by people familiar with the meeting.

Trump laid into Pelosi during an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham broadcast Thursday evening. He made the comments in France, again eschewing the tradition of leaving partisan politics on American shores. Trump himself expressed anger that Pelosi made her remarks while he was abroad.

Trump repeated a recently minted nickname for Pelosi — Nervous Nancy — and said she should divert her attention away from the president’s alleged misdeeds to her home district in San Francisco, which he said has “drugs and needles all over the place.”

“It’s the most disgusting thing what she’s allowed to happen to her district,” he said.

Trump also went after Sen. Joe Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination, saying he “just doesn’t get it” on economic relations with China. During a Tuesday town hall, Biden characterized the economic threat posed by China as less severe than Trump’s trade war would suggest. Trump in turn said Chinese President Xi Jinping would love to have Biden as the Democratic nominee.

Despite his ire toward his adversaries back home, Trump was conciliatory toward one critic abroad: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The German leader has been a vocal advocate of the liberal world order and multilateral cooperation — a stark contrast to the America-first message of Trump.

172,Trump faces rare Republican revolt on judicial pick,Marianne Levine,"Sen. Josh Hawley and some other Republicans have expressed concerns about Michael Bogren to the White House. | Alex Wong/Getty Images white house Trump faces rare Republican revolt on judicial pick A growing number of Senate Republicans and conservative activists are opposed to Michael Bogren's nomination.

President Donald Trump faces a growing Republican rebellion on one of his judicial nominees, throwing his confirmation into doubt.

Michael Bogren, who Trump nominated to serve on a federal district court, is already opposed by three Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee — Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ted Cruz of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — and others could emerge, according to multiple GOP sources. It’s an unusual conflict for a GOP-controlled Senate, which has breezed through nominees.

Story Continued Below

Their complaint centers on a belief that Bogren is no friend to religious liberty after he signed a brief while defending the City of East Lansing against a Catholic couple that opposed same-sex marriage.

“To repeatedly compare this family to the KKK, to compare them to radical Muslim imams who want to take rights away from women… these are inflammatory remarks and they were meant to be inflammatory,” said Hawley, who has been the most vocal opponent of the nominee to sit on the District Court for the Western District of Michigan.

Key conservative advocacy groups, like the Judicial Crisis Network, Heritage Action and Conservative Action Project, have also criticized or come out against Bogren, which could further dampen GOP support.

If Trump ends up withdrawing the nomination or it fails on the Senate floor, it would be an embarrassment to the president and a rare stumble in his push to reshape the judiciary. The episode also underscores the power of social conservative activists to threaten even Republican judicial nominees who don’t completely toe the party line.

But unlike most other Trump judicial nominees, Bogren could still be confirmed with backing from Democrats.

A managing partner at the law firm Plunkett Cooney, Bogren has support from his two Democratic home-state senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan.

“This is somebody with a 30-year legal career who was strongly recommended by a bipartisan committee in Michigan and he’s a Republican nominee,” Stabenow said. “I’m surprised that there would be this kind of reaction to him.”

The case that sparked the controversy involves a Catholic couple that was barred from the city of East Lansing’s farmers market after the couple refused to host a same-sex marriage on their farm, citing religious beliefs. The couple sued the city in response.

In its motion to dismiss the case, the city argued, as an analogy, that a member of the White Camelia Knights of the KKK, which opposes interracial marriage, would not be able to refuse service to an interracial couple.

“An adherent of that particular brand of Christianity who ran a business similar to the plaintiffs’ business would not be able to invoke the free exercise clause to avoid the antidiscrimination provisions of Federal, State and local laws that apply to public accommodations if interracial couples were refused service,” the motion said.

The motion also noted some imams believe that women should not drive but that if someone adhered to that belief and taught driver’s education, he would not legally be able to refuse female customers because of his religion.

Bogren defended the analogies at a tense confirmation hearing, arguing that he merely wanted to make the point that “religious beliefs trying to justify discrimination, if extended to sexual orientation which the City of East Lansing protects, could be used to try to justify any other sort of discrimination.”

But Bogren’s testimony did not sit well with some Republican members of the committee or social conservative activists. Hawley grilled him during the hearing, and Cruz and Tillis later cited Bogren’s performance in the committee as their reason for voting against him.

“I get the idea that we should not necessarily oppose a judicial nominee because they advocated for a client,” said Tillis. “But when he was given an opportunity to say, ‘Can you really rethink the arguments that you use’ and he goes back and doesn’t really respond and says he stands by them, if nothing else it speaks to temperament.”

Hawley and some other Republicans have expressed concerns about Bogren to the White House and it’s unclear if the administration will stand by the nomination. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Some key Judiciary Committee Republicans are backing Bogren, including Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and GOP Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said they remained undecided.

Stabenow and Peters both said they remained optimistic that Bogren would be confirmed and defended him for merely speaking on behalf of his client in the brief. Peters accused Hawley and Cruz of mischaracterizing the brief.

The Bogren fight also highlights how Democratic senators still maintain some small influence over judges through the use of “blue slips” on district court nominees.

Under the blue-slip policy, a home-state senator can effectively veto a nomination if he or she does not approve. The blue-slip policy previously applied to both appellate and district court nominees, but Republicans changed it to only apply to the less-influential district court nominees.

Conservatives cite the blue-slip process as among the reasons the White House has gotten into this mess in the first place.

“Bogren was approved by the two Democrat senators from Michigan — it should come as no surprise that conservatives have grave concerns,” said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network. “He is the product of a failed ‘blue slip’ process that needs reform.”

Unlike many Trump judicial nominees, Bogren is not actively involved in the conservative Federalist Society and does not have the backing of conservative judicial groups willing to spend money to ensure he gets confirmed.

“Parts of the conservative movement are opposing him and other parts of the conservative movement are just not weighing in one way or the other because they view him as a Democrat nominee,” said one conservative leader. “If the Democrats in Michigan want to get him confirmed they can drag him along the finish line on their own.”

Not all on the right are pleased with the pile-on.

Hawley has drawn criticism for the attacks from the conservative Wall Street Journal Editorial Board, which called his legal reasoning “short-sighted.”

“Mr. Hawley’s questioning is a precedent that conservatives will regret,” the Editorial Board wrote. “If nominees can be disqualified for every argument they make for a client, conservative judicial nominees will soon find themselves blocked from judgeships for defending religious liberty.”

It’s also the second time that Hawley has taken friendly fire for scrutinizing a Trump judicial nominee.

Earlier this year, Hawley voiced concerns about Neomi Rao’s views on abortion — prompting a backlash from JCN, which threatened to launch a $500,000 ad buy against the freshman from Missouri. Hawley ultimately voted for Rao to sit on the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

This time, Hawley is unlikely to back down. And he insists the Journal is wrong.

“You can represent a client very vigorously without stooping to personal insults and to really vicious, in this case, anti-faith attacks,” he said.","| Alex Wong/Getty Images white house Trump faces rare Republican revolt on judicial pick A growing number of Senate Republicans and conservative activists are opposed to Michael Bogren's nomination.

Josh Hawley and some other Republicans have expressed concerns about Michael Bogren to the White House. | Alex Wong/Getty Images white house Trump faces rare Republican revolt on judicial pick A growing number of Senate Republicans and conservative activists are opposed to Michael Bogren's nomination.

President Donald Trump faces a growing Republican rebellion on one of his judicial nominees, throwing his confirmation into doubt.

Michael Bogren, who Trump nominated to serve on a federal district court, is already opposed by three Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee — Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ted Cruz of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — and others could emerge, according to multiple GOP sources. It’s an unusual conflict for a GOP-controlled Senate, which has breezed through nominees.

Their complaint centers on a belief that Bogren is no friend to religious liberty after he signed a brief while defending the City of East Lansing against a Catholic couple that opposed same-sex marriage.

“To repeatedly compare this family to the KKK, to compare them to radical Muslim imams who want to take rights away from women… these are inflammatory remarks and they were meant to be inflammatory,” said Hawley, who has been the most vocal opponent of the nominee to sit on the District Court for the Western District of Michigan.

Key conservative advocacy groups, like the Judicial Crisis Network, Heritage Action and Conservative Action Project, have also criticized or come out against Bogren, which could further dampen GOP support.

If Trump ends up withdrawing the nomination or it fails on the Senate floor, it would be an embarrassment to the president and a rare stumble in his push to reshape the judiciary. The episode also underscores the power of social conservative activists to threaten even Republican judicial nominees who don’t completely toe the party line.

But unlike most other Trump judicial nominees, Bogren could still be confirmed with backing from Democrats.

A managing partner at the law firm Plunkett Cooney, Bogren has support from his two Democratic home-state senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan.

“This is somebody with a 30-year legal career who was strongly recommended by a bipartisan committee in Michigan and he’s a Republican nominee,” Stabenow said. “I’m surprised that there would be this kind of reaction to him.”

The case that sparked the controversy involves a Catholic couple that was barred from the city of East Lansing’s farmers market after the couple refused to host a same-sex marriage on their farm, citing religious beliefs. The couple sued the city in response.

In its motion to dismiss the case, the city argued, as an analogy, that a member of the White Camelia Knights of the KKK, which opposes interracial marriage, would not be able to refuse service to an interracial couple.

“An adherent of that particular brand of Christianity who ran a business similar to the plaintiffs’ business would not be able to invoke the free exercise clause to avoid the antidiscrimination provisions of Federal, State and local laws that apply to public accommodations if interracial couples were refused service,” the motion said.

The motion also noted some imams believe that women should not drive but that if someone adhered to that belief and taught driver’s education, he would not legally be able to refuse female customers because of his religion.

Bogren defended the analogies at a tense confirmation hearing, arguing that he merely wanted to make the point that “religious beliefs trying to justify discrimination, if extended to sexual orientation which the City of East Lansing protects, could be used to try to justify any other sort of discrimination.”

But Bogren’s testimony did not sit well with some Republican members of the committee or social conservative activists. Hawley grilled him during the hearing, and Cruz and Tillis later cited Bogren’s performance in the committee as their reason for voting against him.

“I get the idea that we should not necessarily oppose a judicial nominee because they advocated for a client,” said Tillis. “But when he was given an opportunity to say, ‘Can you really rethink the arguments that you use’ and he goes back and doesn’t really respond and says he stands by them, if nothing else it speaks to temperament.”

Hawley and some other Republicans have expressed concerns about Bogren to the White House and it’s unclear if the administration will stand by the nomination. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Some key Judiciary Committee Republicans are backing Bogren, including Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and GOP Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said they remained undecided.

Stabenow and Peters both said they remained optimistic that Bogren would be confirmed and defended him for merely speaking on behalf of his client in the brief. Peters accused Hawley and Cruz of mischaracterizing the brief.

The Bogren fight also highlights how Democratic senators still maintain some small influence over judges through the use of “blue slips” on district court nominees.

Under the blue-slip policy, a home-state senator can effectively veto a nomination if he or she does not approve. The blue-slip policy previously applied to both appellate and district court nominees, but Republicans changed it to only apply to the less-influential district court nominees.

174,White House pledges to barrel ahead with Mexico tariffs,Doug Palmer,"“We are grateful that the Mexican delegation came forward with proposals. It was a good discussion,” Vice President Mike Pence said. | Ian Maule/Tulsa World via AP trade White House pledges to barrel ahead with Mexico tariffs

The White House pledged on Thursday to charge ahead on tariffs on Mexico, saying the U.S. position ""has not changed” after officials met for a second day to address the steady flow of Central American migrants trying to enter the United States.

Talks between Mexican and U.S. officials at the White House wrapped up without resolution. Several key officials in the administration were unavailable for negotiations. President Donald Trump was in France for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, and both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were on the road.

Story Continued Below

In an interview with Fox News in France taped shortly before the D-Day ceremony, Trump defended his strategy of using tariffs to get countries to the negotiating table. He also slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her criticism of him in recent days.

""I actually don't think she's a talented person,"" Trump said. ""I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She's incapable of doing deals. She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

In Washington, the United States and Mexico held more talks Thursday evening at the State Department. Pence told reporters during a stop in Pennsylvania to promote the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that U.S. officials ""made it very clear that Mexico has to step up. They have to do more and they have to do more quickly.""

One U.S. official said more meetings are planned this evening at State Department. The State Department didn't respond to multiple requests for information about Pompeo's whereabouts or who participated in Thursday's talks with the Mexican delegation.

A spokesperson for the Mexican Foreign Ministry said Thursday afternoon that the two sides were still talking.

""We continue to explore options to address the growing number of undocumented migrants that pass through Mexico,"" Roberto Velasco Álvarez wrote on Twitter. “The US position is focused on immigration control measures, ours on development. We have not yet reached an agreement but we continue negotiating.“

Another source familiar with the talks told POLITICO that any deal likely “involves more on enforcement and regional coordination on asylum.”

U.S. officials wouldn’t comment about the specifics of the proposals. “It’s very premature of staff to comment on ongoing negotiations for fear of jeopardizing them,” one White House official said.

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said it was possible that a 5 percent tariff increase scheduled for Monday could be put off while the negotiations continue. ""We’re hopeful that the discussions that are happening right now with the Mexican officials will reach a conclusion and it’s a good one,"" Thune said.

But both Pence and White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders stressed late on Thursday that the administration was pressing ahead with its plan to impose duties next week.

“At this point the tariffs are going to be imposed on Monday,” Pence said in Pennsylvania. “I’m encouraged they came today with more but it will be a matter for the president to consider.”

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) said he has been in frequent contact with officials at the White House and with the Mexican government and indicated that Mexico has shown a new willingness to address U.S. immigration demands. “I think the Mexicans are going to be doing things they really haven’t done in the past,” he said.

The lawmaker said he was “very hopeful” a deal could be reached, but wasn’t discounting Trump’s willingness to impose tariffs.

In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced plans for a rally in Tijuana on Saturday to “defend Mexican dignity” and outline Mexico's response if no deal is reached to avoid tariffs.

The Trump administration has been pressing Mexico to sign a ""safe third country"" agreement, which would require Central American migrants to seek asylum in Mexico if they pass through that country en route to the United States.

Asked about that, Pence said he did not want to negotiate in public. ""But we made it very clear that, in addition to internal enforcement, that there would have to be new understandings between the United States and Mexico.""

Pence told reporters on Thursday before leaving for a D-Day event in Bedford, Va., that the Trump administration had made some progress on Wednesday in talks with Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, but that more work was needed.

“We‘re grateful that the Mexican delegation came forward with proposals. It was a good discussion,” Pence said. “We welcome what [they] put on the table. But, as the president said yesterday, it’s not nearly enough.”

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) vowed to pursue congressional action unless Trump drops his plan.

“The president’s proposed tariffs would hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers,"" Neal said in a statement. ""Commandeering U.S. trade policy to influence border security is an abuse of power. If the president does declare a national emergency and attempt to put these tariffs into place, I will introduce a resolution of disapproval to stop his overreach.”

That could happen as soon as next week, if Trump takes the expected step of declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs, a congressional aide said.

If passed by both houses of Congress, a resolution would have the effect of stopping the new duties. But it's unclear whether opponents of Trump's plan can muster enough votes in both the House and the Senate to overcome a presidential veto.

Most Republicans share Trump's concern about the increase in Central American migrants entering the United States, even if they worry about the harm of tariffs on local businesses and the national economy.

Meanwhile, Customs brokers are warning there has not been nearly enough time for them to prepare for a tariff increase. Industry leaders wrote to the administration on Wednesday, urging it to delay the new import duties until U.S. Customs and Border Protection “can develop the procedures by which importers and brokers and reasonably pay them.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3394/1155968404_6044952615001_6044957848001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" Nancy Pelosi: Trump's Mexican tariffs are no way to 'treat a friend'

“It is our responsibility as the most knowledgeable professionals, to express our grave concern, even alarm, that it will be impossible to comply, as the mechanisms for compliance are not available between now and June 10, or even before the increase planned for July 1,” the Pacific Coast Council of Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association wrote in a letter.

Officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been working to formalize Trump’s plan, which he announced on Twitter late last week, but had little information to share about the effort on Thursday.

“CBP is working through the details and the technical aspects to implement tariffs on Mexico,” a spokesperson for the agency said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week issued an analysis of how tariffs on Mexico would affect various states. Crucial border states like Texas and 2020 battleground states like Michigan and Ohio would be those hardest hit by the duties, the Chamber said.

If a deal is not reached in the next several days, Trump plans to begin imposing a 5 percent duty on all imports from Mexico beginning on Monday and to ratchet that up by 5 percentage points each month until it reaches 25 percent on Oct. 1 or a deal is made.

The firm U.S. tone stood in contrast with Ebrard’s generally upbeat appraisal of meetings at the White House on Wednesday with Pence, Pompeo, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and other administration officials.

“We are optimistic because we had a good meeting with respectable positions from both sides,” Ebrard said Wednesday after the talks. Ebrard and the rest of the Mexican delegation met on Thursday with lower-ranking U.S. officials.

Trump’s mind was also on trade, amid all of the pageantry of his whirlwind trip to Europe, which included a state dinner with the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II.

“The Democrats — Congress has been a disaster. They won't change. They won't do anything. They want free immigration — immigration to pour into our country,” Trump told reporters on the airport tarmac in Ireland before departing for D-Day ceremonies in France.

The president expressed hope about making progress in the trade talks with Mexico. But he also doubled down on his threat, predicting that ""something pretty dramatic could happen.""

He also ripped the criticism he’s received — including from his own party, which has protested his plan and is eyeing a formal rebuke once it’s finally put in motion.

“And a lot of people, senators included, they have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to tariffs,” he told reporters. “They have no — absolutely no idea.”

But both Pence and White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders stressed late on Thursday that the administration was pressing ahead with its plan to impose duties next week.

“At this point the tariffs are going to be imposed on Monday,” Pence said in Pennsylvania. “I’m encouraged they came today with more but it will be a matter for the president to consider.”

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) said he has been in frequent contact with officials at the White House and with the Mexican government and indicated that Mexico has shown a new willingness to address U.S. immigration demands. “I think the Mexicans are going to be doing things they really haven’t done in the past,” he said.

The lawmaker said he was “very hopeful” a deal could be reached, but wasn’t discounting Trump’s willingness to impose tariffs.

In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced plans for a rally in Tijuana on Saturday to “defend Mexican dignity” and outline Mexico's response if no deal is reached to avoid tariffs.

The Trump administration has been pressing Mexico to sign a ""safe third country"" agreement, which would require Central American migrants to seek asylum in Mexico if they pass through that country en route to the United States.

Asked about that, Pence said he did not want to negotiate in public. ""But we made it very clear that, in addition to internal enforcement, that there would have to be new understandings between the United States and Mexico.""

Pence told reporters on Thursday before leaving for a D-Day event in Bedford, Va., that the Trump administration had made some progress on Wednesday in talks with Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, but that more work was needed.

“We‘re grateful that the Mexican delegation came forward with proposals. It was a good discussion,” Pence said. “We welcome what [they] put on the table. But, as the president said yesterday, it’s not nearly enough.”

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) vowed to pursue congressional action unless Trump drops his plan.

“The president’s proposed tariffs would hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers,"" Neal said in a statement. ""Commandeering U.S. trade policy to influence border security is an abuse of power. If the president does declare a national emergency and attempt to put these tariffs into place, I will introduce a resolution of disapproval to stop his overreach.”

That could happen as soon as next week, if Trump takes the expected step of declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs, a congressional aide said.

If passed by both houses of Congress, a resolution would have the effect of stopping the new duties. But it's unclear whether opponents of Trump's plan can muster enough votes in both the House and the Senate to overcome a presidential veto.

Most Republicans share Trump's concern about the increase in Central American migrants entering the United States, even if they worry about the harm of tariffs on local businesses and the national economy.

Meanwhile, Customs brokers are warning there has not been nearly enough time for them to prepare for a tariff increase. Industry leaders wrote to the administration on Wednesday, urging it to delay the new import duties until U.S. Customs and Border Protection “can develop the procedures by which importers and brokers and reasonably pay them.”

“It is our responsibility as the most knowledgeable professionals, to express our grave concern, even alarm, that it will be impossible to comply, as the mechanisms for compliance are not available between now and June 10, or even before the increase planned for July 1,” the Pacific Coast Council of Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association wrote in a letter.

Officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been working to formalize Trump’s plan, which he announced on Twitter late last week, but had little information to share about the effort on Thursday.

“CBP is working through the details and the technical aspects to implement tariffs on Mexico,” a spokesperson for the agency said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week issued an analysis of how tariffs on Mexico would affect various states. Crucial border states like Texas and 2020 battleground states like Michigan and Ohio would be those hardest hit by the duties, the Chamber said.

If a deal is not reached in the next several days, Trump plans to begin imposing a 5 percent duty on all imports from Mexico beginning on Monday and to ratchet that up by 5 percentage points each month until it reaches 25 percent on Oct. 1 or a deal is made.

The firm U.S. tone stood in contrast with Ebrard’s generally upbeat appraisal of meetings at the White House on Wednesday with Pence, Pompeo, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and other administration officials.

“We are optimistic because we had a good meeting with respectable positions from both sides,” Ebrard said Wednesday after the talks. Ebrard and the rest of the Mexican delegation met on Thursday with lower-ranking U.S. officials.

Trump’s mind was also on trade, amid all of the pageantry of his whirlwind trip to Europe, which included a state dinner with the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II.

“The Democrats — Congress has been a disaster. They won't change. They won't do anything. They want free immigration — immigration to pour into our country,” Trump told reporters on the airport tarmac in Ireland before departing for D-Day ceremonies in France.

The president expressed hope about making progress in the trade talks with Mexico. But he also doubled down on his threat, predicting that ""something pretty dramatic could happen.""

He also ripped the criticism he’s received — including from his own party, which has protested his plan and is eyeing a formal rebuke once it’s finally put in motion.

“And a lot of people, senators included, they have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to tariffs,” he told reporters. “They have no — absolutely no idea.”

The White House pledged on Thursday to charge ahead on tariffs on Mexico, saying the U.S. position ""has not changed” after officials met for a second day to address the steady flow of Central American migrants trying to enter the United States.

Talks between Mexican and U.S. officials at the White House wrapped up without resolution. Several key officials in the administration were unavailable for negotiations. President Donald Trump was in France for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, and both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were on the road.

Story Continued Below

In an interview with Fox News in France taped shortly before the D-Day ceremony, Trump defended his strategy of using tariffs to get countries to the negotiating table. He also slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her criticism of him in recent days.

""I actually don't think she's a talented person,"" Trump said. ""I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She's incapable of doing deals. She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

In Washington, the United States and Mexico held more talks Thursday evening at the State Department. Pence told reporters during a stop in Pennsylvania to promote the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that U.S. officials ""made it very clear that Mexico has to step up. They have to do more and they have to do more quickly.""

One U.S. official said more meetings are planned this evening at State Department. The State Department didn't respond to multiple requests for information about Pompeo's whereabouts or who participated in Thursday's talks with the Mexican delegation.

A spokesperson for the Mexican Foreign Ministry said Thursday afternoon that the two sides were still talking.

""We continue to explore options to address the growing number of undocumented migrants that pass through Mexico,"" Roberto Velasco Álvarez wrote on Twitter. “The US position is focused on immigration control measures, ours on development. We have not yet reached an agreement but we continue negotiating.“

Another source familiar with the talks told POLITICO that any deal likely “involves more on enforcement and regional coordination on asylum.”

“It is our responsibility as the most knowledgeable professionals, to express our grave concern, even alarm, that it will be impossible to comply, as the mechanisms for compliance are not available between now and June 10, or even before the increase planned for July 1,” the Pacific Coast Council of Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association wrote in a letter.

Officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been working to formalize Trump’s plan, which he announced on Twitter late last week, but had little information to share about the effort on Thursday.

“CBP is working through the details and the technical aspects to implement tariffs on Mexico,” a spokesperson for the agency said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week issued an analysis of how tariffs on Mexico would affect various states. Crucial border states like Texas and 2020 battleground states like Michigan and Ohio would be those hardest hit by the duties, the Chamber said.

If a deal is not reached in the next several days, Trump plans to begin imposing a 5 percent duty on all imports from Mexico beginning on Monday and to ratchet that up by 5 percentage points each month until it reaches 25 percent on Oct. 1 or a deal is made.

The firm U.S. tone stood in contrast with Ebrard’s generally upbeat appraisal of meetings at the White House on Wednesday with Pence, Pompeo, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and other administration officials.

“We are optimistic because we had a good meeting with respectable positions from both sides,” Ebrard said Wednesday after the talks. Ebrard and the rest of the Mexican delegation met on Thursday with lower-ranking U.S. officials.

Trump’s mind was also on trade, amid all of the pageantry of his whirlwind trip to Europe, which included a state dinner with the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II.

“The Democrats — Congress has been a disaster. They won't change. They won't do anything. They want free immigration — immigration to pour into our country,” Trump told reporters on the airport tarmac in Ireland before departing for D-Day ceremonies in France.

The president expressed hope about making progress in the trade talks with Mexico. But he also doubled down on his threat, predicting that ""something pretty dramatic could happen.""

He also ripped the criticism he’s received — including from his own party, which has protested his plan and is eyeing a formal rebuke once it’s finally put in motion.

“And a lot of people, senators included, they have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to tariffs,” he told reporters. “They have no — absolutely no idea.”

Steve Bullock will not make the stage.

A prominent governor running in the Democratic primary is at serious risk of getting shut out of the party’s first presidential debates — while a meditation guru and obscure tech entrepreneur take the stage for the most important event of the race so far.

That’s the state of play less than a week before the deadline to qualify for the debates on June 26-27 under the rules set by the Democratic National Committee.

Story Continued Below

Presidential hopefuls have until June 12 to cross one of two thresholds to qualify for the primary debates, and 13 of the 20 slots available are set. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is currently out, one of the foremost candidates in danger of missing the stage. His camp blasted what it called the DNC's eleventh-hour ""unmasking"" of ""arbitrary"" polling rules, but the DNC said the Bullock campaign has been aware of the criteria for months.

Bullock’s status isn’t the only question remaining in the final week of qualifying, but the latest update comes after the Democratic National Committee provided POLITICO with additional guidance about its polling criteria — the first time the party committee has publicly addressed questions surrounding the previously announced guidelines.

The DNC declined to comment, as it has done in the past, on the qualifications for any individual candidate. POLITICO’s analysis for who has (and has not) qualified for the debate is based off public polling and public comments from the campaigns about their donor counts.

But if Bullock does manage to qualify before next Wednesday’s deadline, it could throw the status of other second-tier candidates into doubt, unleashing a complicated set of DNC-written tiebreaker rules that could leave another current officeholder high and dry.

In order to be eligible for the debates, candidates must cross one of two thresholds: earning 1 percent in three polls approved by the DNC, or receiving donations from 65,000 people, with 200 in 20 different states. Thirteen have met both thresholds and clinched their spots. But there are at least 10 credible candidates bidding for the final seven spots — a list that includes two sitting senators, three congressmen, a governor, a former governor and the mayor of New York.

Next week’s deadline is a make-or-break moment for these second-tier candidates, who risk fading into irrelevance if they aren’t among the 20 candidates onstage in Miami.

The 13 candidates who can book their tickets include the race’s top figures. Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Julián Castro are the top-polling candidates; following a random drawing, they will be split across the two nights, with five on one night and four on the other.

But also meeting both the polling and fundraising thresholds are Tulsi Gabbard, Jay Inslee and two lesser-known figures: Marianne Williamson, best known for authoring spiritual, self-help books, and Andrew Yang, a first-time candidate who wears a baseball cap that says “MATH” on the front as he touts his proposal for a universal basic income.

After those 13 candidates, the rest of the field gets murky. According to a POLITICO analysis, an additional seven candidates have hit the polling threshold: Michael Bennet, Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, Kirsten Gillibrand, John Hickenlooper, Tim Ryan and Eric Swalwell.

That list does not include Bullock — who POLITICO has previously believed to have qualified. On Thursday, the DNC told POLITICO that a pair of Washington Post/ABC News polls would not be considered eligible polls that candidates can use to qualify. One of the three polls Bullock would have relied on to qualify was a Post/ABC poll taken in January.

Bullock’s campaign was sharply critical of the announcement. ""While Gov. Bullock was expanding Medicaid to one in ten Montanans despite a two-thirds Republican legislature, the DNC was making arbitrary rules behind closed doors,"" Jenn Ridder, Bullock's campaign manager, said in a statement. ""The DNC's unmasking of this rule singles out the only Democratic candidate who won a Trump state — and penalizes him for doing his job.""

""We notified the Bullock team in March, so they have known for months,"" DNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told POLITICO shortly after the publication of this story.

The rules, initially announced in February, list ABC News and The Washington Post as qualified poll sponsors, but did not give any guidance on methodology. ABC/Post polls stood out from the rest of the qualified polls because, unlike every other poll that can qualify candidates for the debate stage, the ABC/Post poll asked respondents about the Democratic primary in an open-ended question, as opposed to reading off a list of candidates.

But there was nothing laid out in the original set of rules that explicitly ruled out open-ended polling from counting for the first and second debates. Arguably, earning 1 percent in a poll in which respondents have to volunteer a candidate’s name instead of repeating it from an interviewer’s list is an even higher bar to meet. And the initial set of rules were announced after the first ABC/Post poll was already publicly released.

POLITICO was not alone in its assessment believing that Bullock has passed the threshold, before the DNC announced the Post/ABC poll will not count. Other media outlets — including MSNBC (one of the media partners for the first debate), ABC News, The Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, and New York magazine — had all previously published analysis saying Bullock has crossed the polling threshold. Bullock is the only candidate whose debate prospects currently are hinging on the ABC/Post poll.

The DNC also publicly announced how to count a Reuters poll that had multiple samples, which affirms de Blasio as a qualifying candidate — something POLITICO’s analysis could not originally confirm.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll presented results among several samples. In one sample of all Americans, de Blasio has crossed the 1 percent bar. In another sample included in the poll, a slightly more restrictive screen of registered voters, de Blasio has not.

POLITICO had long opted to use the sample of registered voters from the May poll in its analysis as opposed to the all Americans sample, but several other outlets previously listed de Blasio as a qualifying candidate, using the all Americans sample. The DNC affirmed to POLITICO that it is counting the all Americans sample, definitively giving de Blasio his third qualifying poll.

A de Blasio campaign official told POLITICO Wednesday that de Blasio asked DNC Chairman Tom Perez which sample would count in the past and was told the adult sample counted. Until Thursday, the DNC had not publicly clarified which sample to count. The Reuters/Ipsos polls were also conducted online, the only qualified polls to do so.

The DNC has moved to address these disputed polls, which have long vexed those trying to forecast the debate stage, for later debates. For the debates that will be hosted in the fall, Reuters was struck as an approved poll sponsor, and a rule was instituted to explicitly disallow open-ended questions from counting.

The DNC has said it will allow no more than 20 candidates across the two nights in June — leaving no room to spare with 20 candidates having qualified, by POLITICO’s updated analysis. The DNC, is the final arbiter for who has qualified for the debate.

But all hope for making the first debate stage is not lost for Bullock. There’s still six more days to go for candidates to qualify, and more polls may still come out in that time period.

If Bullock does ultimately qualify, that would make 21 candidates who have met at least one of the two criteria. The DNC has repeatedly said it would limit the first two debates to 20 participants, and it has outlined a series of tiebreakers to trim the field.

Candidates who have not crossed both thresholds will be sorted by their polling average — which is calculated by taking a candidate’s top three-highest polls, so long as those polls are from different pollsters, or the same pollster in different regions. So far, no candidate who has only crossed the polling threshold has a polling average higher than 1.5 percent.

Three of these candidates have an average of 1.3 percent: Gillibrand, Hickenlooper and Ryan. The remainder — Bennet, de Blasio, Delaney and Swalwell — have a polling average of 1 percent (Bullock could join this group).

Rep. Seth Moulton, Wayne Messam and former Sen. Mike Gravel have not crossed either threshold. They appear unlikely to hit the polling threshold, based off past results, and because 20 candidates have hit the polling threshold, it is impossible for them to qualify through donors alone.

To break any tie among candidates with identical polling averages, the DNC previously announced that it will then look at the number of qualifying polls in which a candidate received 1 percent. Delaney has four polls, but the remaining 1-percent candidates have only three polls, the bare minimum to get on stage.

If the DNC determines that more than 20 candidates have crossed the polling threshold, the difference between the 20th candidate on the stage and the 21st candidate left off could — theoretically — be determined by one candidate getting 1 percent in one more poll than the other candidate. Every poll for lower-tier candidates could be crucial.

But with many of the lower-tier candidates frequently posting zeroes in qualified polls, it is also plausible that there’s a tie in both the polling average and in the number of qualified polls between the 20th and 21st candidate. The DNC did not answer questions about what would happen in that situation.

After the DNC confirms which 20 candidates qualified next Wednesday, there will be a random drawing — expected on June 14 — to determine the debate lineups.

The candidates will be split into two groups: one of high-polling candidates (those whose average is at or above 2 percent) and one of the lower-polling candidates. Those two groups will then be evenly and randomly divided across the two nights.

The DNC has moved to address these disputed polls, which have long vexed those trying to forecast the debate stage, for later debates. For the debates that will be hosted in the fall, Reuters was struck as an approved poll sponsor, and a rule was instituted to explicitly disallow open-ended questions from counting.

The DNC has said it will allow no more than 20 candidates across the two nights in June — leaving no room to spare with 20 candidates having qualified, by POLITICO’s updated analysis. The DNC, is the final arbiter for who has qualified for the debate.

But all hope for making the first debate stage is not lost for Bullock. There’s still six more days to go for candidates to qualify, and more polls may still come out in that time period.

If Bullock does ultimately qualify, that would make 21 candidates who have met at least one of the two criteria. The DNC has repeatedly said it would limit the first two debates to 20 participants, and it has outlined a series of tiebreakers to trim the field.

Candidates who have not crossed both thresholds will be sorted by their polling average — which is calculated by taking a candidate’s top three-highest polls, so long as those polls are from different pollsters, or the same pollster in different regions. So far, no candidate who has only crossed the polling threshold has a polling average higher than 1.5 percent.

Three of these candidates have an average of 1.3 percent: Gillibrand, Hickenlooper and Ryan. The remainder — Bennet, de Blasio, Delaney and Swalwell — have a polling average of 1 percent (Bullock could join this group).

Rep. Seth Moulton, Wayne Messam and former Sen. Mike Gravel have not crossed either threshold. They appear unlikely to hit the polling threshold, based off past results, and because 20 candidates have hit the polling threshold, it is impossible for them to qualify through donors alone.

To break any tie among candidates with identical polling averages, the DNC previously announced that it will then look at the number of qualifying polls in which a candidate received 1 percent. Delaney has four polls, but the remaining 1-percent candidates have only three polls, the bare minimum to get on stage.

If the DNC determines that more than 20 candidates have crossed the polling threshold, the difference between the 20th candidate on the stage and the 21st candidate left off could — theoretically — be determined by one candidate getting 1 percent in one more poll than the other candidate. Every poll for lower-tier candidates could be crucial.

But with many of the lower-tier candidates frequently posting zeroes in qualified polls, it is also plausible that there’s a tie in both the polling average and in the number of qualified polls between the 20th and 21st candidate. The DNC did not answer questions about what would happen in that situation.

After the DNC confirms which 20 candidates qualified next Wednesday, there will be a random drawing — expected on June 14 — to determine the debate lineups.

The candidates will be split into two groups: one of high-polling candidates (those whose average is at or above 2 percent) and one of the lower-polling candidates. Those two groups will then be evenly and randomly divided across the two nights.

183,What Elizabeth Warren Gets Wrong About Impeachment,Rob Goodman,"Peter Summers/Getty Images 2020 What Elizabeth Warren Gets Wrong About Impeachment The left is correct that Trump is a national emergency. That’s why it would be irresponsible to disregard the political consequences of trying to remove him from office.

Rob Goodman is a political theorist at Ryerson University and a former Democratic congressional speechwriter.

A new wave of impeachment fever has taken hold among Democrats, one that casts removing President Donald Trump from office as a moral imperative. Last week, after Robert Mueller’s dramatic TV appearance, Kamala Harris said that starting impeachment proceedings is “our constitutional obligation.” Cory Booker called it “a legal and moral obligation.” Back in April, Elizabeth Warren said President Donald Trump’s misconduct “demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations.” Here’s one more, from Richard L. Hasen at Slate: “Members of Congress take an oath to uphold the Constitution and it is their constitutional duty to determine if Trump’s conduct merits impeachment, regardless of the political consequences.”

If the House ever does pass articles of Trump’s impeachment, this will probably be the framing that drives the decision: that impeachment is the only principled stand against not just Trump, but against craven, finger-in-the-wind politics.

Story Continued Below

But even if you believe that Trump is a national emergency—a dangerously unchecked president chipping away at democracy every week he’s in office—that doesn’t make impeachment the right move. The evidence from both our own politics and from other countries with Trumpian leaders suggests that impeachment can be morally right, legally justified, and still politically irresponsible. The pro-impeachment wing of the Democratic Party is focused on the first two considerations at the expense of the third.

The idea of treating impeachment as a duty—and, by extension, deliberately ignoring its politics—might be morally satisfying. But it’s dangerous for Democrats and for the nation.

Americans who see Trump as a national emergency—and there are many, from leftists to never-Trump conservatives—have two real goals: first, increasing the chances of removing Trump from office in the short term, and second, strengthening the rule of law in the long term. Impeachment proceedings would set back the first goal and aren’t likely to advance the second.

If the Trump presidency is an emergency, then any action that increases the chances of Trump remaining in office—no matter how morally satisfying that action may be—is reckless. Given the near certainty that the Republican-controlled Senate will not remove him from office, the essential consideration is whether impeaching the president will increase or decrease the likelihood of beating him at the polls in 17 months.

The best assumption is that impeachment will make Trump more likely to win four more years in office. Evidence from around the world makes a compelling case that fighting right-wing authoritarians and populists on the grounds of their personal corruption or lawbreaking doesn’t get the job done. Figures from Silvio Berlusconi to Viktor Orbán to Benjamin Netanyahu to Nigel Farage have all been attacked on those grounds—and still won election victories in the face of scandals on the scale of Trump’s. To their supporters, “our guy’s” corruption is excusable or even laudable.

If Trump’s first election led many of us to reasonably and belatedly downgrade our confidence in American exceptionalism—it can happen here—then we need to put that lesson to use: It can happen here again if we don’t learn from oppositions who have tried corruption-centered strategies and failed. Democrats’ performance in the 2018 midterms, in fact, was a master class in successfully opposing right-populism: through a single-minded focus on its material consequences for voters. Last November, nearly all of the damaging findings from the Mueller Report had already been widely publicized, along with evidence of Trump’s tax fraud, along with Trump’s taped admission of sexual assault—and yet the winning campaign’s focus was not Trump, but health care.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/1108/1155968404_6036723957001_6036677541001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Impeachment would represent a retreat from that strategy. Its very drama and personalization works against Democrats, because it would pull attention away from their best case at displacing him. It would focus voters on the Trump Tower meeting instead of student loan forgiveness, the firing of James Comey instead of protecting and building on Obamacare. Nancy Pelosi was right: In 2018, the Democrats ran, and won, on policy. If pro-impeachment Democrats believe that putting the president’s crimes at the heart of the party’s message will lead to a better result in 2020, they should make that case. Instead, they’re ostentatiously refusing to make it.



***

Yet even if you think that impeachment increases the odds of a second Trump term, you might still believe that risk to be worth taking in order to deter future presidents from committing impeachable acts. Warren has made the most powerful case for taking the long view: “To ignore a president’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways.”

But that argument is based on two very shaky assumptions. The first is that Democrats’ best efforts at precedent-setting will mean anything at all if Trump wins another term, consolidates his power and continues reshaping the judiciary. They won’t.

The second assumption is that impeachment followed by instant acquittal would be any kind of deterrent for future abuses of power. On the contrary, the signal would be that presidents can abuse their power as long as their party controls one house of Congress.

For Democrats—or any Americans—anxious about what they’re witnessing, the question isn’t so much how to create theoretical deterrents to future presidents’ wrongdoing as it is how to transform the actual Republican Party into the kind of organization willing to stand up to it. That’s a generational project, but the best way to start it is by defeating Republicans in elections, winning political power, and using that power to begin rolling back the undemocratic features of our political system—from voter suppression, to gerrymandering, to the overrepresentation of white, rural states in the Senate, to the Electoral College—that allow minority rule.

That’s the irony in Warren’s embrace of impeachment. In developing an ambitious policy agenda aimed at American oligarchy, she’s worked from the premise that our problem is not so much Trump as it is the political and economic structures that made Trumpism possible. But in lending her moral authority to impeachment, she’s supporting a step that would effectively center the Democrats’ message on Trump himself.

That would be a serious mistake. Wherever Democrats think Trumpism comes from—whether they blame Russian election interference, economic dislocation, xenophobia or some unholy combination of the three—they won’t be able to redress the conditions that enable it without winning and using power. If impeaching the president advanced that goal, Democrats should support it. If it doesn’t, they shouldn’t. Treating that goal as somehow beside the point is irresponsible, not principled.

What Democrats need most right now isn’t moral conviction about Trump’s awfulness, but political judgment: the ability to calculate complicated causes and effects, read the political moment in all its specifics, and make a choice in the absence of certainty.

Earlier generations called that quality “statesmanship.” There’s good reason for those of us on the left to be skeptical of that term, with its narrow and gendered implications about who gets to wield political power, and its clear whiff of elitism. I don’t want to give up on the idea that movements of ordinary people can drive political change, or that, say, labor leaders like A. Philip Randolph or Dolores Huerta are as capable of “statesmanship” as senators and presidents. But I don’t want to give up on the idea that word stands for, either: that there is such a thing as political judgment, that it’s a meaningful kind of expertise, that it’s separate from and complementary to expertise in policy, and that it’s one of the main qualifications for political office. Nancy Pelosi may not be an expert communicator, but her success in winning the only two House majorities for Democrats since 1994, and in pushing through the most ambitious piece of social legislation since the Great Society, suggests that she has this kind of expertise, and that we shouldn’t take her advice lightly.

To treat impeachment as an obligation, a kind of constitutional absolute, is to demand a moral certainty that politics can’t provide. Even when Democrats share the same objectives, getting to those objectives means estimating a score of complicated, interacting probabilities, simultaneously, in real time. Insisting on that point isn’t weakness or triangulation or “ overthinking .” It’s just thinking.

The case against the impeachment of President Trump is based on moral compromise, uncertainty, and calculated deference to experts. It doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker. But the easy case for impeachment—“the right thing is obvious, expert judgment is irrelevant, tell the politicians to stop playing games and get on with it”—is scarily reminiscent of the case for Trump. “Statesmanship,” scare quotes and all, is the antithesis of both, not least because it’s about helping people accept that politics cannot and should not always be morally satisfying.","Peter Summers/Getty Images 2020 What Elizabeth Warren Gets Wrong About Impeachment The left is correct that Trump is a national emergency.

184,How Legal Weed Is Killing America’s Most Famous Marijuana Farmers,Natalie Fertig,"Natalie Fertig is a writer in Washington, D.C.

EUREKA, Calif. — On a sunny day in the spring, Thomas Mulder walked through his greenhouse, down a narrow path between two long, knee-high, wooden planters. In a few weeks, the greenhouse would be full of marijuana plants a foot or two high—indica-sativa hybrid strain Sour G, or White Tahoe Cookies with its characteristic golden hairs around the flower. A few more months and the plants would reach Mulder’s shoulders. But at that moment, the planters were empty as Mulder gestured with his hands to show how tall his crop would eventually become. Mulder has three greenhouses that sit on this flat patch of land deep in the mountains of Humboldt County. This part of his farm is accessible only by a steep, newly paved road that passes in and out of Humboldt Redwoods State Park, and giant trees crowd so close on either side of the property that you don’t even notice Mulder’s farm until the last bend of the road.

It’s pretty obvious why Mulder’s parents chose this place in the late 1970s to grow marijuana. Back then, camouflage ropes pulled tall branches over the clearing to hide the illegal but highly prized crop from Drug Enforcement Administration helicopters; huckleberry bushes grew among marijuana for extra concealment. Now, the array of bright white buildings would be easily spotted from above, that is if anyone was up there looking. The berry bush camouflage came out when Mulder bought this land a decade ago when California became the first state to approve medical marijuana.

Story Continued Below

Since then, as the stigma around marijuana has evaporated in a grassroots legalization movement that has swept the nation, Mulder’s farm has thrived in a three-county region known as the Emerald Triangle that has become to high-grade cannabis what Napa Valley is to wine—a tentpole of the Northern California economy. In an ideal season, Mulder’s farm produces about 1,000 pounds of cannabis, an amount that should earn him $1.5 million. After taxes, fees and farm operating expenses, Mulder can expect about $100,000 in net income. It has afforded him enough money to own his own house and set aside a retirement account and a college fund for his children. No longer an outlaw like his parents, Mulder is the very picture of middle-class respectability. He has served on the local school board for a decade without anyone batting an eye at how he earns a living.

In theory, business should have gotten better for Mulder after voters passed Proposition 64 in 2016, legalizing recreational marijuana. But the opposite has happened.

The costs of shifting his farm from California’s loosely regulated medical marijuana program into the stringent legal market have been high. Mulder actually lost money last year—the worst loss his farm has ever experienced—and he had to dip into his retirement fund and his children's college fund to keep from closing. A few years ago, his retirement savings totaled over $80,000. After last year, he says, he has about $500 left.

Mulder is not alone. As industrial-sized growers in places like California’s famously fertile Central Valley have flooded the market, the price of legal marijuana has plummeted by more than half. An array of upfront fees and stricter regulations, combined with a lack of access to bank loans, are all reasons farmers in Humboldt and neighboring Mendocino and Trinity counties say they can’t afford to remain in the legal market. Only 2,200 farmers applied for cannabis licenses last year, according to California NORML, compared with the estimated 30,000 or more growers who existed in the Emerald Triangle pre-legalization. It’s hard to know how many of the rest are continuing to grow in the illicit market. An estimated 10 percent of growers have simply shut down. Some expect that number to rise fivefold by year’s end.

“The regulatory climate in California and the cost of all of those regulations certainly does make the prospect of a viable small farm really small,” says Trillian Schroeder, a cannabis farm consultant in Humboldt County.

In effect, legal marijuana is doing what the DEA’s war on drugs never managed to accomplish. Some observers fear the era of cannabis in Humboldt—legal and otherwise—is over.

Mulder voted for Prop 64, reasoning that the initial proposals—like a one-acre cap on licenses—were designed to help farmers. But now he’s not so sure it was the right call.

“I don’t want to see more victims of the war on drugs,” Mulder says. “But now it’s different because it’s a different war—it’s pricing [farmers] out.”

“I wish I could go back in time,” he says. “Maybe not pass Prop 64.”

***

When medical marijuana was first legalized with the passage of the Compassionate Care Act in 1996, some of Humboldt’s farmers were wary of coming forward and registering with a government they had seen for so long as the enemy. Eventually, though, many came out of the illicit market to grow in licensed medical collectives. The medical industry that existed from 1996 to 2016 had some regulations—there was a limit to the number of plants a farm could grow, for example, set by each county individually. Farmers had to apply for a license and pay taxes to the state. And in the late 2000s, some towns—such as Oakland—started putting local sales taxes in place. But in the spectrum of regulatory oversight, it was a modest burden.

Under Prop 64, though, cannabis has become what some in the industry call “the most regulated crop in the nation’s most regulated state.” Each plant must be meticulously monitored through a central system called “track and trace.” There are separate state and county regulations, and the county requirements—from additional taxes to environmental impact studies—can be drastically different for farmers in different parts of the state. And where farmers once paid just income and maybe some sales taxes on their medical marijuana, they are now paying taxes before they grow, after they grow, and after they sell.

Zoning certificates and water board fees can cost $3,000 to $5,000, but the biggest costs come in environmental and structural changes to the property. Many Humboldt farms lie in the mountains, deliberately out of the way to avoid easy detection, at the end of long dirt roads that are hard to navigate. Paving the dirt roads alone can cost over $100,000.

Some farms have discovered their land includes habitat for endangered species like the spotted owl. When these farmers apply for construction permits to meet Prop 64 requirements like paved roads or new, California Department of Agriculture-compliant processing facilities, they are told they need to wait two years for an environmental impact study, certifying the proposed changes won’t disturb endangered habitat. The farmers are caught in a bureaucratic trap: If they don’t build immediately, the farms won’t be considered compliant, and therefore may not receive a new license to keep growing.

Other farms have man-made geological features, such as culverts, that were put in by previous tenants—often loggers. Under state and local regulations, these man-made features have to be returned to a more ecologically friendly form, a process which also requires engineering fees and construction costs to repair.

And for farms that have good existing infrastructure on good land, there are still high taxes and fees they have to pay in addition to their startup costs. The “canopy tax” is a county tax on the space in which a farmer will grow his crop—levied before anything is grown. Last year, it was $1 per square foot. Many farmers grow multiple plots of 5,000 or 10,000 square feet, so canopy taxes can quickly reach the tens of thousands of dollars. The cultivation tax, meanwhile, is a state tax levied on harvested marijuana before it is sold, regardless of whether it sells. Neither the canopy or cultivation taxes supplant state or federal income taxes, which also have to be paid on the revenue from cannabis sales.

For Mulder, the cultivation tax on dried cannabis flower last year was $148 per pound. After paying it, a modest $15,000 profit turned into an $80,000 loss.

“It’s death by a thousand cuts,” says Schroeder, the farm consultant.

Some of these farmers feel that they are being held to standards intended for “big ag” that don’t make sense for small family farms. “You know, $20,000 to a big avocado farm is absolutely nothing,” Schroeder says. “But you put that same cost onto a small three-person farm, it’s a big hurdle for them to overcome.”

One Humboldt County farmer, Wendy Kornberg, says she cannot hire temporary workers to help her harvest her crop because she would need a bathroom on her property that is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Getting a cement truck up her hill to construct such a bathroom without paving the road first is impossible, and she won’t have the money to pave until harvest is over. So her 70-year-old mother has been helping out, instead.

Kornberg, a second-generation cannabis farmer, has used most of her savings trying to meet state and local licensing requirements.

She applied for a permit to construct a rainwater pond to water her crops. The building and planning department said her papers were in order, and all she needed was her county cannabis license in order to build. She waited eight months for that license. When it was issued, it included extra requirements for the pond, raising the cost from $20,000 to as high as $100,000. She had to scrap the pond altogether, and the lack of water meant she grew and harvested only about 10-15 percent of her annual yield, even after paying $53,000 in canopy taxes and fees.

“If you were a corn farmer, and you were only cultivating 100 acres of corn, and you’re suddenly told, ‘OK, you can only cultivate 10 acres of corn,’ you’re basically going to be bankrupt,” Kornberg said. “It’s ridiculous to think a farm can operate at 10 percent.”

Some of the biggest blows to farmers under the new regulations come in the form of cultivation and canopy taxes . For Mulder, the cultivation tax on dried cannabis flower turned a $15,000 profit into an $80,000 loss. | Talia Herman for Politico Magazine

In other industries, startup costs or unexpected regulation changes are funded by small-business loans. In the marijuana industry, however, access to loans is almost impossible to come by. Cannabis’ status as a Schedule I drug means the federal government considers it as dangerous as heroin, and consequently banks won’t open accounts, issue loans, or open lines of credit for businesses in the industry. Farmers can’t apply for crop insurance, either, or file for bankruptcy if their farm collapses.

There are some loans available, but they are high-interest private loans or venture capital—both of which many farmers don’t trust.

Mariah Gregori says she could really use a loan. Gregori spent 20 years building her homestead in the mountains with her partner and their children. But when she began the process of switching her farm into the regulated market, she found that the costs of making her land compliant were more than her farm was worth—and far more than she had the money to pay.

So Gregori, 41, and her partner drained their savings and bought a new piece of land, on a flat patch near a river. There, they are building a new cannabis farm from the ground up, gambling that the costs of bringing this flat land up to code will be cheaper than wading through the regulatory minefield her original farm presented.

Just trying to build and permit the same water tank she has at her homestead on the new farm plot is promising to cost Gregori over $50,000, and Gregori says she cannot get a line of credit to help build her water supply and make other improvements to the new property. She also can’t write off business expenses like $50,000 water tank projects on her federal taxes.

“I mean this is my life … it’s the only thing we’ve ever worked for,” Gregori says. “We’ve done it since out of high school.”



***

The California state government is not oblivious to the fact that taxes and regulations have overburdened the state’s cannabis industry. In fact, it’s suffering too.

State-wide revenue from cannabis taxes in 2018—the industry’s first year under full legalization—met only 30 percent of projections set by the state. California projected $1 billion in tax revenue, but at the end of 2018 had seen only $345 million, according to the Orange County Register.

On the local level, Humboldt County decided this year to charge its farmers the canopy taxes after the harvest rather than before growing, so farmers can pay from their revenue. And in Sacramento, a law called the “Temporary Cannabis Tax Reduction Bill” was introduced by state Rep. Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) and California State Treasurer Fiona Ma, but did not pass out of committee. Their bill would have temporarily suspended some taxes for three years, with the hopes of giving farmers as much capital as possible to get on their feet, and Bonta plans to reintroduce the bill next year.

Meanwhile, California’s Senate did pass a bill that will create a state-chartered bank to offer bank accounts to cannabis busineses, though Bonta says it will not issue loans or lines of credit. Ultimately, he says, banking is the purview of the federal government. Congress is working on the issue of cannabis banking right now, with the SAFE Banking Act legislation. The bill passed the House Financial Services Committee in April with a bipartisan vote of 45-15.

Democrat Representative Jared Huffman’s California district includes Humboldt County, and he is a co-sponsor of the House bill. “Criminalizing banking for businesses that are legal under state law is completely absurd,” Huffman said in a statement, adding the SAFE act has overwhelming public support.

While it enjoys widespread support in the U.S. House—165 members from both parties have already signed on to co-sponsor the bill, and it is backed by the American Banking Association—its passage isn’t guaranteed in the Senate. Since pushing through a legalization of hemp (the nonpsychoactive cousin of cannabis that is being used as a substitute crop in tobacco country) in the 2018 Farm Bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will not bring a cannabis legalization bill to the floor. If McConnell doesn’t block a vote in the full Senate, though, the banking bill has support on both sides of the aisle, including five Republicans, among them Rand Paul of Kentucky, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Cory Gardner of Colorado, as well as Democrats such as Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and lawmakers from states where cannabis is still illegal, such as Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.).

Should that federal bill not pass, California’s lawmakers don’t yet have a solution—though some say they are working on one. Some have proposed using cryptocurrency or credit unions.

Meanwhile, though, Humboldt County’s economy has been hit hard by cannabis legalization. Humboldt was the only county that lost sales tax revenue last year—dropping 2 percent from 2017 to 2018, or $424,000. In Eureka, it dropped 3 percent. Meanwhile, California, over the same period, saw a 4 percent increase.

“For us, it was such an important part of our economy that [legalization] really has been an upheaval to the way we’ve been doing business for decades,” says Mayor Susan Seaman of Eureka, Humboldt’s largest town.

Seaman says Eureka has seen a marked decrease in sales tax in the past year, as farmers spend their money on fees and regulations rather than in town. This change in spending has led some noncannabis businesses in Humboldt County to close, while others have dramatically shifted their inventory in order to stay afloat.

Humboldt County’s Small Business Development Center did an unscientific survey of its members in June 2018, and of those who answered, only 28 percent believed business would be better in 2018 than it was in 2016. In the same survey, more business owners selected “changes in the cannabis industry” as the reason for the economic decline than any other factor.

Over the past three decades, cannabis farmers in Humboldt put their income back into the local economy, buying clothes and home goods, machinery and cars, and eating in local restaurants.

In Eureka, sales tax revenue decreased in the past year despite cannabis manufacturers like Los Angeles-based Papa & Barkley bringing over 100 jobs to the area. And should the small cannabis farms go under, Seaman worries the new jobs won’t stay.

Annie Bignon, 37, owned a boutique clothing store in Garberville called Indigo Denim Bar. In 2017, Indigo Denim Bar saw a 30-percent drop in revenue. July 2018 was the tipping point, when her shop registered 60 percent less revenue than the previous July.

She and her husband—who owns a construction business—both grew up in Humboldt. “It was a thriving community, with people who had the disposable income,” Bignon said. But in November 2018, they decided to leave Garberville and open her store elsewhere, before they lost everything. Now, they and their two kids live four hours south, in Sebastopol. Every time she talks about it, Bignon starts crying. Her family was one of five from the same block who moved in the past year. Two families moved to northern Humboldt, but the other three—including Bignon’s—left the county entirely. “One of my friends said ‘Who’s going to still be here?’”

On his farm on the backside of the mountain, Thomas Mulder continues to lose sleep over farm expenses. But he has a good reason to keep going, he says. His son Tyson, 8, loves to grow things. While regulations keep Tyson out of the cannabis plots, he attentively listens to everything his father teaches him about running a farm—from creating healthy soil to road upkeep. He helps out wherever he can, filling in potholes on the road and working with vegetables and trees in his own garden space.

Like other second-generation farmers, Mulder believes in the greater Humboldt community and wants to see it continue to flourish. Cannabis farmers have done a lot of good in Garberville, he says, like donating money to refurbish the local school. Now, as his daughter nears graduation from high school, he wants to make sure there is a future for her and for her brother in Humboldt County.

He is the author of several works of political history including, most recently, Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.

What do you do when a great hero is alleged to have done something awful?

Politicians, historians, universities, artists and citizens in general have been grappling with this question for years. Renewed attention to racism and discrimination has prompted the reassessment of historical giants from Andrew Jackson to Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill to Gandhi. Sexual harassment revelations have felled a forest of cultural, political and business bigshots. Tasteless jokes, dubious comments or ill-advised tweets have led to scores of people being fired from prominent positions.

Story Continued Below

Now Martin Luther King Jr. is in the spotlight. On Thursday, David J. Garrow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of King—and the author of other acclaimed books on Roe v. Wade and Barack Obama—reported in the conservative British magazine Standpoint on explosive material that he found in recently published FBI documents. The article, based on FBI reports summarizing the bureau’s audio surveillance of King, makes for uncomfortable reading, to say the least.

The most shocking claim Garrow relates is that King was present in a hotel room when a friend of his, Baltimore pastor Logan Kearse, raped a woman who resisted participating in unspecified sexual acts. The FBI agent who surveilled the room asserted that King “looked on, laughed and offered advice.” Other allegations include that King’s philandering—long known to be extensive—was even more rampant than historians knew; that King took part in group sex; that King may have fathered a child with one of his mistresses; and—less pruriently—that King continued taking money from his onetime ally Stanley Levison, a Communist Party member, even after he was supposed to have broken off ties.

Right-wing media have pounced on the story, fairly delighting in the discomfort it poses to liberals, especially those who’ve been calling for the demotion of other eminences. “Martin Luther King Jr. Was Reportedly an Abuser Who Laughed at Rape,” blared The Daily Wire. “Is It Time to Tear His Monuments Down?” Meanwhile, liberal and mainstream media have so far seemed skittish about the topic—as Garrow discovered when he tried but failed to get several non-partisan U.S. publications to run it. (One paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, reported on Garrow’s claims last week while also publishing a thorough account of its decision not to publish the original article itself.) News outlets usually pause before running salacious allegations against public figures, especially when they’re open to doubt—although in recent years that restraint has been eroding quickly. But with a long-dead historical figure, the hesitancy is more surprising. It’s easy to wonder if a desire to shield King’s reputation, or to avoid Twitter blowback, could be at work. Even discussions of history, it seems, are becoming ever more politically polarized.



***

Since the 1986 publication of Bearing the Cross, his account of King’s life from the Montgomery bus boycott until his assassination, Garrow has periodically written articles updating the story of the FBI’s surveillance of King—as he did, for example, in the Atlantic in 2002. These latest tidbits come from bureau reports and summaries that were recently published online under terms of the 1992 President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. Inside this new records dump, Garrow discovered, were a number of FBI documents that pertained to King. “Winnowing the new King items from amidst the Archive’s 54,602 web-links, many of which lead to multi-document PDFs that are hundreds of pages long,” Garrow noted in his new piece, “entailed weeks of painstaking work.”

The reports are full of erotic details and include revealing handwritten marginalia. But to the uninitiated, the written reports that Garrow cites are hard to interpret. They can’t be checked against the original surveillance tapes, which remain sealed, according to a judge’s order, until 2027. It’s hard to tell from a glance who precisely authored them, for what purpose they were drafted or what information they’re based on. It is Garrow’s decades of expertise in reviewing and analyzing FBI materials about King that gives these startling revelations their weight. Garrow has explained that while not all FBI claims are to be believed, these sorts of summaries of surveillance intercepts are unlikely to have been fabricated or manipulated.

And Garrow’s overall assessment is measured. Nowhere does he renounce the esteem for King that can be seen in his three important books on the minister’s life. Rather, he proposes that the possibility King tolerated or abetted a rape “poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible.” Garrow concludes with a call to preserve the recordings on which the FBI reports are based, so that we can learn more when they’re scheduled to be opened eight years from now.

Not everyone, however, has been so judicious in putting these FBI documents into context. Standpoint published a companion editorial to Garrow’s piece asserting that “the wiretaps reveal [King] to be the Harvey Weinstein of the civil rights movement.” That analogy is absurd. For one thing, King himself isn’t said to have assaulted women (although “offering advice”—whatever that might mean—to a friend committing a rape certainly comes close). For another, Garrow is relying on summaries, not the original wiretaps, and those summaries can’t be taken at face value. As we know in part from Garrow’s past research, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI was obsessed with King. Notoriously, bureau agents tried to blackmail him into committing suicide by sending him a letter threatening to expose his affairs. Also, summaries aren’t recordings; it’s hard even to imagine how audio recordings could offer dispositive proof that a rape did or didn’t happen. This context thus weighs against any simple conclusion about the incident. The magazine’s overwrought editorial undermines Garrow’s patient work.

An equally untenable judgment, however, comes from the Washington Post’s “Retropolis” blog, headlined with a historian’s quote declaring Garrow’s article to be “irresponsible.” The thrust of the article is to insinuate that the FBI reports aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, and so Garrow shouldn’t have published them. But while the Post piece quotes some respected historians (including friends of mine) rightly noting that the FBI documents may not be entirely reliable—not least because of Hoover’s vendetta against King—it avoids the obvious, if painful, corollary that they may well be accurate to a significant degree. We should at least allow the possibility that the accusations are true.

That’s why it’s a mistake to discount Garrow’s article wholesale. Any historian who came across a new cache of documents related to a longstanding area of research would feel compelled to explore it—and, if those materials shed new light on the subject, to publish them. When in 1990, Stanford University’s Clayborne Carson and other scholars at the King Papers Project found that King had committed plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation and other works, they felt obliged to divulge it—even though, as one editor on the project said, he suffered “many hours of lost sleep.” That the revelations in this case turned out to be scandalous warrants, as Garrow argues, intensified efforts to confirm or rebut their veracity. Bringing them to light, while acknowledging their uncertainty, is perfectly defensible.



***

Garrow’s disclosures are, in fact, important to incorporate into our historical knowledge. First, whether or not the allegations against King are true, they add weight to the widely held conclusion that Hoover’s FBI was a corrupt organization, in particular in its pursuit of King and the civil rights movement. The extent of their surveillance, even if originally motivated by legitimate concerns about Soviet influence (via Stanley Levison), seems in retrospect to be excessive.

Second, the piece strengthens the picture of the bureau as inordinately fixated on sex, whether out of the prurience of its director and agents or out of a misbegotten assumption that engaging in what the reports call “unnatural acts” (seemingly oral sex) somehow indicates “degeneracy and depravity.” Alas, this tendency to take private sexual behavior as an indicator of virtue remains all too prevalent today. Historians of sexuality will continue to consider FBI surveillance as a “site of contest,” as we academics like to say, over sexual behavior and norms.

Most important, the piece will surely prompt discussion of how to assimilate these allegations, should they be true, into our understanding of King. It’s worth remembering that we’ve discovered unflattering sides of King before. News of his philandering has been common knowledge since at least the 1975 Church Committee hearings into the dubious actions of the U.S. intelligence agencies. The 1989 memoir of King’s close associate Ralph Abernathy divulged that he spent the night before his assassination with a mistress. The following year saw the news about his plagiarism.

King’s greatness is such that he has weathered these disclosures. The rape charges are of course graver, but they don’t negate the historic achievements for which he has long been properly celebrated.

Even if the ugliest charges against King are bolstered by additional evidence, that doesn’t mean we should talk about renaming Martin Luther King Day, tearing down statues of him, or stripping him of his Nobel Prize. In recent years, we’ve had altogether too much wrecking-ball history—history that takes public or private flaws or failings as reason to cast extraordinary men and women out of our political or artistic pantheons. Historians know that even the most admirable figures from our past were flawed, mortal beings—bad parents or bad spouses, capable of violence or cruelty, beholden to sexist or racist ideas, venal or megalomaniac, dishonest or predatory. Awareness of these qualities doesn’t mean despising figures once held up as heroes. Rather, it gives us a more complete and nuanced picture of the people who shaped our world.

“It was Mr. King whose quest for black economic and social progress started this nation on the road to full integration—the most dynamic step forward in the status of the races since the Civil War. His courage in breaking down racial taboos and facing down opponents of integration, his unwavering insistence on a peaceful revolution, the elevating power of his message to the nation are beyond question.” So opined the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal in 1990, days after the same paper brought King’s plagiarism to light. “We suspect Mr. King’s reputation will outlast the questions now being raised,” it concluded. That judgment—from a leading conservative opinion outlet of the day—seems far more sensible than the troll-like schadenfreude peppering right-wing media in the last few days. They are words we should bear in mind again today.

186,Britain Is in No Position to Scoff at Donald Trump,Alex Massie,"Alex Massie is a columnist for the Times of London.

Donald Trump arrived in London on Monday to a less-than-thrilled welcome. Sky News teased a video of a giant balloon baby version of the president that is set to make an appearance in London this week. Activists gamely projected an image of Trump’s and Barack Obama’s dueling popularity ratings on the side of the Tower of London—a reminder that just 1 in 5 voters has a positive view of Trump, compared with nearly three-quarters for Obama. Although timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, the visit inevitably emphasizes the distance between that era of cooperation and the present, more strained status of the “special relationship.”

“We should not be rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump,” was how Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it. “Trump is doing great damage to British interests and our traditional alliance with the U.S.”

Story Continued Below

Britons might be launching their predictably sniffy anti-Trump response to the visit, but the reality is that the United Kingdom today is in no position to scoff at other countries’ political misadventures. Both nations are still reeling from a political storm that hit in 2016. But as the United States processes the unorthodox and disruptive presidency of Donald Trump, Britain has become increasingly paralyzed—even broken—by the drama triggered by its vote to leave the European Union. Last month’s elections to the European Parliament were a disaster for outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May’s ruling Conservative Party and little better for the major opposition party, Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn. Trump arrives in a country very much not at ease with itself.

There is little true purpose to his state visit, save to the extent that an invitation to Buckingham Palace indulges the American president. Tellingly, no one-on-one meeting has been arranged with the lame-duck May, who announced her upcoming resignation after failing to get her Brexit plan through Parliament. Like his hosts, Trump seems more interested in her successor than in poor May herself.

Boris Johnson, the Conservative former foreign secretary, is the candidate best placed to succeed May—but no fewer than a dozen Tory members of Parliament have confirmed they are running. Trump told the Sunday Times that Johnson was “a friend” who “would be excellent.” The basis for this estimation was, typically, that “he has been very positive about me and our country.” Johnson evinces an unsinkable confidence in his own ability to renegotiate a better deal with the EU, despite little evidence that a new, more palatable, agreement can be struck.

Trump is also a fan of the bombastic Nigel Farage, the former leader of the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party who has returned to front-line politics as head of the newly formed Brexit Party. Although Parliament remains under the control of the traditional parties, Farage’s upstart had the single strongest showing of any in the European Parliament elections, and its leader vows that unless Brexit really means Brexit, his insurgent movement will destroy both the Conservative and Labour parties. “I like Nigel a lot,” Trump told the Sunday Times. “I got to know him when he liked my campaign, and he actually came to a speech, and I met him.” Farage, he suggested, should be included in any future Brexit talks. “Think how well they would do if they did. They just haven’t figured that out yet.” Silly them.

Although Trump will be the focus of the pomp and the protests this week, his presence in the UK is one of the few things capable of uniting Britain’s fractious politics. In a recent opinion poll, the public was asked to decide whether May or Corbyn would be the best possible prime minister. Fully 55 percent of respondents said they could not rank either politician better than the other. Twenty-three percent said May was preferable to Corbyn, and 15 percent deemed the Labour leader the superior option. That is, the opposition is no more trusted than a widely mistrusted ruling government.

British politics have been hollowed out by the remorseless logic of post-referendum politics, with each side more deeply entrenched than it started out. During the Brexit referendum in 2016, pro-leave politicians claimed Britain held “all the cards” as it began to negotiate the terms of its EU withdrawal. That was a fanciful distortion of what was plausible or probable. Now, rather than compromise or accept the logic of trade-offs, committed Brexiteers have redefined success as a clean, hard, “no deal” Brexit, in which the UK would leave the EU and trade with Europe on World Trade Organization terms. This would almost certainly produce an enormous economic shock, but as a political matter, it would “deliver” Brexit.

For their part, “remain” voters have been given little reason to compromise by a government that preferred to define Brexit in terms of managing the disparate parts of the Conservative Party, rather than as a truly national project. Brexit was for the 52 percent who voted “leave,” and that left little room for the 48 percent who opted to remain. Opinions have become so polarized that leave and remain identities are now stronger than traditional party allegiances.

Brexit cannot be achieved, but nor can it be escaped; there is no realistic way to make Brexit happen, but nor can the vote just be repealed. This is the fundamental paradox on which all else rests—and one that should be familiar to Americans, whose politics have turned into a similarly angry standoff around the popular but unkeepable promises of its president. There is no majority in the House of Commons for a “no deal” Brexit, but nor is there a majority to pass any agreement with the EU either. And so, the U.K. finds itself in limbo—the political version of a Samuel Beckett play.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1674/1155968404_6044203989001_6044205505001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

Only a new prime minister and a new general election promises a release from this purgatory. But an election, at the present moment, promises more risks than rewards. One recent poll concluded that the combined level of support enjoyed by the Conservative and Labour parties has fallen below 40 percent. For the moment, the pro-Europe Liberal Democrats, whose slogan in last month’s European Parliament elections was “Bollocks to Brexit” and Farage’s newly formed Brexit Party, for whom Brexit is, in the British vernacular “the dog’s bollocks” (i.e., a mighty fine thing), are carving up British politics between them.

In those European elections, more Conservative members voted for Farage’s Brexit Party than for their own tribe—a rebellion against the governing party’s inability to deliver Brexit. Labour, however, benefited little from the government’s plight. Many habitual Labour voters deserted the party and endorsed Liberal Democrat or Green candidates. Remarkably, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair’s wife, Cherie, and his former spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, each admitted to voting Lib Dem.

That reflected an impatience with Labour’s policy of deliberate ambiguity on Brexit. The party wishes to give the impression of backing Brexit in pro-leave areas of northern England, while cultivating the notion that it is against Brexit in London and other key cities in the south of England. There, Labour dangles the possibility of a “public vote” on the eventual outcome of the Brexit negotiations, whereas elsewhere it insists the referendum result must be honored so long as the outcome is what the party calls a “jobs-first Brexit.” That no such thing exists is not something voters are encouraged to dwell upon.

An election might punish all the right people, but only at the price of rewarding another group of all the wrong people.

As much as Brits dislike Trump—and as quick as Trump was to criticize the mayor of his host city, Sadiq Khan, upon arrival—the truth is that the relationship between the United States and Britain does not depend on the strength of personal ties between the president and the prime minister. At the moment, given the absence of leadership in London and the caliber of leadership in Washington, this seems just as well.

Brexit was supposed to be a liberation of sorts, after which the U.K. would become a larger player on the world’s stage. Instead, it has ruined British politics and left the country seeming—and feeling—a smaller, lonelier place. A visit from Trump merely confirms this sense of isolation and weakness. An “America First” president is an unlikely ally for a country that is looking for a new role to play in the world’s affairs.","Donald Trump arrived in London on Monday to a less-than-thrilled welcome.

187,How a Sex Offender's Case Before the Supreme Court Could Bring Down the Administrative State,Todd Tucker,"Todd N. Tucker is a political scientist and fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. He is author of “Judge Knot,” a book about international law’s promises and perils. Follow him on Twitter @toddntucker.

Herman Gundy was out on supervised release in 2004 from a 1996 crack distribution conviction when he met an 11-year-old girl. He served her cocaine and raped her.

As soon as Monday, the Supreme Court will rule on his fate.

Story Continued Below

While court-watchers have been focused on other headline issues the court may decide this term—including cases on abortion, citizenship questions on the Census, and partisan gerrymandering—the Gundy case could mark a watershed of its own. At issue isn’t the lurid crime itself, but just how much power Congress can delegate to the executive branch.

Along with a new trade-related case the court may choose to take up in the coming weeks, it’s part of a campaign to use the courts in service of a libertarian rollback of the administrative state. And a nation in which both Gundy and American Institute for International Steel (the trade case) go against the government could look very different.

Gundy has become a cause célèbre among libertarian legal activists, who see in his case an opening they’ve long sought. The question before the court turns on whether Congress delegated too much of its legislative power. It concerns the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act—under which Gundy was convicted—a law named after the kidnapped and murdered child of “America’s Most Wanted” host John Walsh and which established detailed instructions for state governments to maintain sex offender registries. For sex offenders whose original offenses and convictions came before the law was enacted Congress opted to let the Department of Justice set up detailed rules for those registries.

This is where the libertarians and their lawyers have pounced: They argue that Gundy’s case is emblematic of a government that concentrates too much decision-making power in the hands of bureaucrats not directly accountable to the people. Gundy ran afoul of these rules when he did not register while living in a New York halfway house. He was rearrested, put on supervised release and ordered to register. If the underlying law were unconstitutional, then Congress would have to rewrite the law or he might skirt registration requirements in the future.

In a series of amicus briefs in his support, groups with names like DownsizeDC.org and Gun Owners of America,which considers itself even more hard-line on gun rights than the NRA, have cited everything from the Bible to the French philosopher Montesquieu in their efforts to attach the convicted rapist to a holy crusade for liberty from government interference.

This is part of a long argument over just how much power Capitol Hill can hand over to presidents. For adherents of the “nondelegation doctrine""—people who believe that any kind of law like this is an invitation to overreach by a bloated executive branch—Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution vests Congress with “all legislative powers.” This power is unalienable, meaning Congress can’t decide to let courts or agencies make law. Nonetheless, the line is blurry between law-writing, law-enforcing and law-interpreting.

The Supreme Court has only twice struck down laws under the so-called nondelegation doctrine—both times in the 1930s, reining in FDR’s New Deal. In Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan in 1935, the justices deemed that a New Deal oil conservation law provided “no criterion to govern the President’s course.” Five months later, in Schechter v. U.S., a unanimous ruling by liberals and conservatives on the bench found that New Deal “fair competition” codes for industry lacked “any adequate definition of the subject to which the codes [were] to be addressed,” allowing the president to restructure the whole economy. President Franklin Roosevelt, his governing agenda under threat, threatened to pack the court. Miraculously, the court would never rule against the New Deal again. Indeed, in the 88 years since, conservative and liberal justices alike have deferred to the division of labor that the political branches agreed to. In the words of Justice Antonin Scalia, “We have almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.”

Libertarian organizations dislike this deference. What they’d prefer is a regime in which Congress kept the power over the nitty-gritty of executing laws—which would mean, to their delight, lawmaking would basically screech to a halt in a morass of tiny details. This would make it nearly impossible for Congress to write rules for the economy. One of their strongest likely allies is the newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the Federalist Society. As he has written in a lower court case against the Environmental Protection Agency, “Congress’s failure to enact general climate change legislation does not license an agency to take matters into its own hands, even to solve a pressing policy issue such as climate change.”

Long-game-playing legal activists are betting that Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has made similar rulings, will be more willing than Scalia and others to revisit the old political bargains. With Gundy, who more moderate groups like the American Civil Liberties Union also support for sound criminal justice reasons, they may have found their opening. As awkward as it is for avowed Christian conservative judges to side with a sex offender, the plaintiffs are betting that justices’ dislike of the administrative state is even greater.

Beyond Gundy, waiting in the wings is another major nondelegation case. American Institute for International Steel v. U.S., is a case brought by progressive lawyers on behalf of steel importers upset with the Trump administration's levying of steel tariffs for national security reasons. Like the Adam Walsh bill, the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which enabled the steel tariffs, delegates substantial authority to the executive branch. Not only does the president get to determine the nature and duration of import restrictions, he is allowed to consider factors such as preserving a stock of experienced steelworkers and “the economic welfare of the nation.” And sure enough, the administration’s argument for the tariffs is not a traditional national security one but is one based more on competitiveness and concern with the health of manufacturing communities.

If Kavanaugh and company side with Gundy, they may well side with the steel group—because both cases would require rolling back 88 years' worth of the same line of precedent. Unsurprisingly, libertarian groups have weighed in on the steel group's case as well with amicus briefs. The upshot: Sex offenders and steel importers may get some relief, but at the risk of giving the conservative legal movement a legal cudgel to weaken ambitious schemes to rebuild our economy and halt the rise of inequality.

A post-Gundy nation may be one in which Congress faces even higher hurdles than those it already faces. Instead of merely having to get a majority of the House, a filibuster-proof Senate majority, a veto-empowered president and aggressive courts on board, lawmakers may have to spell out in excruciating detail how agencies have to do their jobs. Imagine already overwhelmed lawmakers having to micromanage thousands of scientists and financial regulators in between constituent services and fundraising. Not a recipe for success.

While libertarian groups claim to be supporting Gundy and American Institute for International Steel in the name of the rule of law, skeptics can be forgiven for concluding the real aim is fewer laws altogether.

188,Pelosi tells Dems she wants to see Trump ‘in prison’,Heather Caygle,"“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. | Win McNamee/Getty Images congress Pelosi tells Dems she wants to see Trump ‘in prison’ She also clashed with Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, who pressed her to begin impeachment proceedings.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi told senior Democrats that she’d like to see President Donald Trump “in prison” as she clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler in a meeting on Tuesday night over whether to launch impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi met with Nadler (D-N.Y.) and several other top Democrats who are aggressively pursuing investigations against the president, according to multiple sources. Nadler and other committee leaders have been embroiled in a behind-the-scenes turf battle for weeks over ownership of the Democrats’ sprawling investigation into Trump.

Story Continued Below

Nadler pressed Pelosi to allow his committee to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump — the second such request he’s made in recent weeks only to be rebuffed by the California Democrat and other senior leaders. Pelosi stood firm, reiterating that she isn’t open to the idea of impeaching Trump at this time.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. Instead of impeachment, Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, according to the sources.

They said she was expressing solidarity with pro-impeachment Democrats who want to hold the president accountable while disputing the idea that it is now time to take that step. Pelosi has long argued that certain conditions must be met before Democrats begin impeachment — public support and strong bipartisan backing, neither of which have so far materialized.

Other Democrats said Pelosi’s comment wasn’t that surprising given her previous criticisms of the president, including saying Trump “is engaged in a cover-up,” that his staff and family should stage an intervention and that the president’s actions “are villainous to the Constitution of the United States.”

Ashley Etienne, a Pelosi spokeswoman said Pelosi and the chairmen “had a productive meeting about the state of play with the Mueller report. They agreed to keep all options on the table and continue to move forward with an aggressive hearing and legislative strategy, as early as next week, to address the president’s corruption and abuses of power uncovered in the report.”

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) were also present for the meeting. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) — a vocal impeachment supporter whose panel is probing Trump’s finances — was not in attendance.

In Tuesday’s meeting, some committee chairs expressed frustration about the appearance that rank-and-file members — rather than party leaders — were leading the caucus’ oversight strategy, including what they do on impeachment, according to one source familiar with the meeting.

But not all committee leaders were supportive of the impeachment inquiry. Both Schiff and Neal argued that if Democrats are going to open an inquiry, they should also be prepared to impeach Trump, which the caucus isn’t ready to do, they said. Cummings also sided with Pelosi, according to a source.

Neal also grumbled about Democrats who have come out in favor of impeachment, saying it puts pressure on members in bordering congressional districts to explain why they don’t feel the same way. House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) — whose district touches Neal’s — came out for impeachment last week.

The meeting is just the latest example of the impeachment debate that is roiling the Democratic Caucus. Pelosi is facing continued pressure both publicly from some rank-and-file members and privately from committee leaders like Nadler, who are unhappy with the current strategy.

The gulf between Nadler and Pelosi was on full display Wednesday as the New York Democrat dodged questions about whether he and Pelosi were in agreement on Democrats’ impeachment strategy.

“We are investigating all of the things we would investigate, frankly, in an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler said on CNN. He then paused for several seconds when asked if he and Pelosi were “on the same page.”

“When that decision has to be made, it will be made not by any one individual, it will be made probably by the caucus as a whole,” Nadler added. “Certainly Nancy will have the largest single voice in it.”

Pelosi, meanwhile, is trying to publicly project unity — going so far as to defiantly declare Wednesday that “there is no controversy” within the caucus over impeachment.

“Make no mistake, we know exactly what path we’re on. We know exactly what actions we need to take,” Pelosi told reporters earlier Wednesday, hitting her palm on the podium for emphasis.

In reality, the speaker and her top lieutenants have been trying to tamp down a rebellion within the caucus, as close to 60 members have publicly declared they want to begin impeaching Trump.

Trump, meanwhile, has continued to stonewall Democrats’ every attempt to investigate his administration, personal finances and charges of obstruction of justice outlined by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Party leaders have tried to relieve some of the pressure by taking more aggressive public action against the White House’s repeated defiance, including scheduling a contempt vote on the House floor next week against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn.

And Democratic leaders continue to emphasize that their methodical, step-by-step oversight process is working, pointing to recent federal court victories Democrats have secured against Trump’s efforts to block them. Nadler is also still trying to secure Mueller’s testimony before his committee.

But for a growing number of Democrats, including several members of the Judiciary Committee, opening impeachment proceedings is the only recourse.

Reps. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), all members of Democratic leadership and the Judiciary panel, first raised the idea of launching an impeachment inquiry during a private leadership meeting late last month only to be shot down by Pelosi.

Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and other top Democrats met with Nadler separately that night as he again unsuccessfully argued for opening an impeachment inquiry.

Nadler, Raskin and other lawmakers say opening an inquiry doesn’t necessarily result in impeachment and would strengthen their legal case as Democrats pursue Trump in court in an effort to force him to comply with their investigations. But other Democrats argue that the public wouldn't understand the difference between an inquiry and actual impeachment, which would only further muddle the party's message in the run-up to the election.

Pelosi has repeatedly said she doesn’t think trying to impeach Trump is “worth it,” arguing that without the public on their side, the best way to beat the president is to persuade voters to kick him out of office in 2020. She and some other top Democrats worry that pursuing impeachment would swamp their legislative agenda and embolden the Republican base, possibly costing them the House next year and ensuring Trump’s reelection.

“I’m not feeling any pressure,” Pelosi told reporters Wednesday.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi told senior Democrats that she’d like to see President Donald Trump “in prison” as she clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler in a meeting on Tuesday night over whether to launch impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi met with Nadler (D-N.Y.) and several other top Democrats who are aggressively pursuing investigations against the president, according to multiple sources. Nadler and other committee leaders have been embroiled in a behind-the-scenes turf battle for weeks over ownership of the Democrats’ sprawling investigation into Trump.

Nadler pressed Pelosi to allow his committee to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump — the second such request he’s made in recent weeks only to be rebuffed by the California Democrat and other senior leaders. Pelosi stood firm, reiterating that she isn’t open to the idea of impeaching Trump at this time.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. Instead of impeachment, Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, according to the sources.

They said she was expressing solidarity with pro-impeachment Democrats who want to hold the president accountable while disputing the idea that it is now time to take that step. Pelosi has long argued that certain conditions must be met before Democrats begin impeachment — public support and strong bipartisan backing, neither of which have so far materialized.

Other Democrats said Pelosi’s comment wasn’t that surprising given her previous criticisms of the president, including saying Trump “is engaged in a cover-up,” that his staff and family should stage an intervention and that the president’s actions “are villainous to the Constitution of the United States.”

Ashley Etienne, a Pelosi spokeswoman said Pelosi and the chairmen “had a productive meeting about the state of play with the Mueller report. They agreed to keep all options on the table and continue to move forward with an aggressive hearing and legislative strategy, as early as next week, to address the president’s corruption and abuses of power uncovered in the report.”

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) were also present for the meeting. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) — a vocal impeachment supporter whose panel is probing Trump’s finances — was not in attendance.

In Tuesday’s meeting, some committee chairs expressed frustration about the appearance that rank-and-file members — rather than party leaders — were leading the caucus’ oversight strategy, including what they do on impeachment, according to one source familiar with the meeting.

But not all committee leaders were supportive of the impeachment inquiry. Both Schiff and Neal argued that if Democrats are going to open an inquiry, they should also be prepared to impeach Trump, which the caucus isn’t ready to do, they said. Cummings also sided with Pelosi, according to a source.

Neal also grumbled about Democrats who have come out in favor of impeachment, saying it puts pressure on members in bordering congressional districts to explain why they don’t feel the same way. House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) — whose district touches Neal’s — came out for impeachment last week.

The meeting is just the latest example of the impeachment debate that is roiling the Democratic Caucus. Pelosi is facing continued pressure both publicly from some rank-and-file members and privately from committee leaders like Nadler, who are unhappy with the current strategy.

The gulf between Nadler and Pelosi was on full display Wednesday as the New York Democrat dodged questions about whether he and Pelosi were in agreement on Democrats’ impeachment strategy.

“We are investigating all of the things we would investigate, frankly, in an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler said on CNN. He then paused for several seconds when asked if he and Pelosi were “on the same page.”

“When that decision has to be made, it will be made not by any one individual, it will be made probably by the caucus as a whole,” Nadler added. “Certainly Nancy will have the largest single voice in it.”

President Donald Trump’s threats to impose blunt new tariffs on Mexico has unleashed a circular firing squad among Republicans in Congress.

A bloc of Senate Republicans is threatening to put up a veto-proof majority to block the tariffs if Trump moves forward by using his national emergency powers. But most House Republicans and another faction of GOP senators say their colleagues are making a mistake by undercutting the president on one of his signature issues.

Story Continued Below

“I’m disappointed that so many of my colleagues are quick to announce their opposition,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “By so publicly rebuking the president's strategy you undermine the very leverage that could end this thing quickly. That's the irony to me.""

The public split not only risks embarrassing the president and his party. It undercuts the shared goal Republicans have in avoiding the tariffs that Trump seems eager to deploy.

At issue is a conflict over strategy. Some GOP lawmakers hope to pressure Trump with the prospect of a rebellion that far exceeds the dozen defections on his national emergency declaration this winter, while others argue for a quieter persuasion campaign.

The dual approaches are scrambling ideologies and voting blocs on Capitol Hill. Take Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), both up for reelection in red-hued states but who have far different conclusions about the president's tactics.

“I’m not in favor of this. The president needs to rethink it,” warned Ernst, who backed Trump’s national emergency on the border. “The president needs to understand that we’re opposed to these tariffs. We don’t think it’s a smart way forward. The president has his own opinion, he’s a tariff guy but I think we have a lot of folks in opposition.”

Tillis made clear his disagreement with his colleagues’ critiques of the tariffs.

“We’re making a mistake if we oppose the tariffs. Because we’re already seeing positive movement,” said Tillis, who vowed to oppose the last national emergency declaration before ultimately voting to uphold it. “You could lead Mexico to believe that all they have to do is wait out a resolution of disapproval. So I think it slows down the pace of negotiations.”

Tariffs are the longest-running GOP dispute with the president, particularly among Senate Republicans, and the president’s vow to impose 5 percent tariffs each month until Mexico tightens up the border has alarmed them more than ever given the broad economic impacts. Fundamentally, most Republicans hate tariffs and do not believe they are effective tools, and many would join Democrats to overturn a national emergency declaration from Trump.

“Why suffer a losing vote that maybe they’d put up here in the Senate?” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is close to Trump. “I think [new tariffs are] a bad idea and I think there’s a possibility that there could be a veto proof-majority,”

But congressional Republicans are not coordinating to send the president a unified message about what the consequences might be if Trump moves forward. Even if the Senate is able to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto, it would be all for naught if the House Republicans are working in the exact opposite direction.

“There would be a few [Republicans voting against the president], but nowhere near the 55 threshold,” said Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill. “Absolutely not.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not hide his caucus’ displeasure on Tuesday after meeting with Trump administration officials about the tariffs. On Wednesday in an interview with Fox News, he professed a ""lack of enthusiasm among Senate Republican for what would amount to a tax increase, frankly, on working class people.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has acknowledged that his caucus shares the Senate GOP’s concern over the Mexico tariffs. But the California Republican has taken an entirely differently approach to the situation.

The GOP leader is not only urging his members to rally around the president, but he is even turning his fire on his Senate colleagues for undermining Trump.

“We should empower the president to be able to have a strong hand in negotiation,” McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. “If members here were undercutting him, it only hurts.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/2322/1155968404_6044582814001_6044586070001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

“We should be united so there won’t be tariffs,” he added.

And it’s clear that Trump feels like McCarthy is in his corner. The president appeared to erroneously attribute a quote to McCarthy on Twitter that offered a far stronger defense of Trump than what McCarthy has actually said. McCarthy, however, did not push back.

The different approaches within the House and Senate GOP reflect a broader contrast with how Republicans in each chamber have dealt with Trump as well as their different incentives.

House Republicans have been far more reluctant to publicly rebuke the president than their Senate colleagues. Representatives are elected every two years, and those worried about job security have less room to maneuver politically. Most of them are more concerned about pro-Trump primary challengers rather than a Democrat in a general election.

“Republicans are primarily free-traders. Trump is obviously tariffing a lot of things, it’s hurting some of our producers, some of our manufacturers,” said Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.). “But he’s also well-loved in many districts. So it will be a tough vote for some folks... We struggle with this tariff issue.”

Senators, who serve six-year terms and represent entire states, seem to have far fewer reservations about panning Trump’s tariffs or going after him on other matters as well. And harsh tariffs on Mexico are far more alarming than the steel and aluminum tariffs on allies that Republicans have already repeatedly threatened to block.

“I’m not for the tariffs,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). The number of Republicans in opposition “is significant.”

“Tariffs are not the right way to go and there’s no reason that millions of farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses in Texas should pay the price and face billions in additional taxes,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

At the Tuesday lunch with administration officials, no senator spoke in support of the president’s position. But that doesn’t mean Senate Republicans are united. Far from it.

Some Senate Republicans are disappointed their colleagues are resorting to such public warnings. They feel that the president has tried everything he can on Mexico, with no help from Congress, so that panning the tariffs does little to make positive change.

“I understand what the president is trying to do, and I understand where he’s coming from. I would say to my colleagues and others: ‘If you have a better idea, fantastic,'"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).

For McConnell and his deputies, the divergent views in the caucus makes for an awkward spot. Like McCarthy, they know their leadership roles mean they generally must be supportive of the president.

McCarthy, who has faced challenges from the conservative Freedom Caucus and could face a leadership fight one day from Minority Whip Steve Scalise, has clung particularly close to Trump.

But it's clear Republican leaders don't like the tariffs either. And the last thing they want to do is referee another intraparty feud about the president's unilateral actions on the border as the primary season draws ever closer for their members.

""The message was pretty clear coming out of the lunch that there are a lot of concerns about it,"" said GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the party whip. ""Hopefully we'll see coming out of the next couple of days whether or not this idea can be turned off.""

President Donald Trump’s threats to impose blunt new tariffs on Mexico has unleashed a circular firing squad among Republicans in Congress.

A bloc of Senate Republicans is threatening to put up a veto-proof majority to block the tariffs if Trump moves forward by using his national emergency powers. But most House Republicans and another faction of GOP senators say their colleagues are making a mistake by undercutting the president on one of his signature issues.

The public split not only risks embarrassing the president and his party. It undercuts the shared goal Republicans have in avoiding the tariffs that Trump seems eager to deploy.

“I’m not in favor of this. The president needs to rethink it,” warned Ernst, who backed Trump’s national emergency on the border. “The president needs to understand that we’re opposed to these tariffs. We don’t think it’s a smart way forward. The president has his own opinion, he’s a tariff guy but I think we have a lot of folks in opposition.”

Tillis made clear his disagreement with his colleagues’ critiques of the tariffs.

“We’re making a mistake if we oppose the tariffs. Because we’re already seeing positive movement,” said Tillis, who vowed to oppose the last national emergency declaration before ultimately voting to uphold it. “You could lead Mexico to believe that all they have to do is wait out a resolution of disapproval. So I think it slows down the pace of negotiations.”

Tariffs are the longest-running GOP dispute with the president, particularly among Senate Republicans, and the president’s vow to impose 5 percent tariffs each month until Mexico tightens up the border has alarmed them more than ever given the broad economic impacts. Fundamentally, most Republicans hate tariffs and do not believe they are effective tools, and many would join Democrats to overturn a national emergency declaration from Trump.

“Why suffer a losing vote that maybe they’d put up here in the Senate?” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is close to Trump. “I think [new tariffs are] a bad idea and I think there’s a possibility that there could be a veto proof-majority,”

But congressional Republicans are not coordinating to send the president a unified message about what the consequences might be if Trump moves forward. Even if the Senate is able to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto, it would be all for naught if the House Republicans are working in the exact opposite direction.

“There would be a few [Republicans voting against the president], but nowhere near the 55 threshold,” said Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill. “Absolutely not.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not hide his caucus’ displeasure on Tuesday after meeting with Trump administration officials about the tariffs. On Wednesday in an interview with Fox News, he professed a ""lack of enthusiasm among Senate Republican for what would amount to a tax increase, frankly, on working class people.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has acknowledged that his caucus shares the Senate GOP’s concern over the Mexico tariffs. But the California Republican has taken an entirely differently approach to the situation.

The GOP leader is not only urging his members to rally around the president, but he is even turning his fire on his Senate colleagues for undermining Trump.

“We should empower the president to be able to have a strong hand in negotiation,” McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. “If members here were undercutting him, it only hurts.”

“We should be united so there won’t be tariffs,” he added.

And it’s clear that Trump feels like McCarthy is in his corner. The president appeared to erroneously attribute a quote to McCarthy on Twitter that offered a far stronger defense of Trump than what McCarthy has actually said. McCarthy, however, did not push back.

The different approaches within the House and Senate GOP reflect a broader contrast with how Republicans in each chamber have dealt with Trump as well as their different incentives.

“We’re making a mistake if we oppose the tariffs. Because we’re already seeing positive movement,” said Tillis, who vowed to oppose the last national emergency declaration before ultimately voting to uphold it. “You could lead Mexico to believe that all they have to do is wait out a resolution of disapproval. So I think it slows down the pace of negotiations.”

Tariffs are the longest-running GOP dispute with the president, particularly among Senate Republicans, and the president’s vow to impose 5 percent tariffs each month until Mexico tightens up the border has alarmed them more than ever given the broad economic impacts. Fundamentally, most Republicans hate tariffs and do not believe they are effective tools, and many would join Democrats to overturn a national emergency declaration from Trump.

“Why suffer a losing vote that maybe they’d put up here in the Senate?” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is close to Trump. “I think [new tariffs are] a bad idea and I think there’s a possibility that there could be a veto proof-majority,”

But congressional Republicans are not coordinating to send the president a unified message about what the consequences might be if Trump moves forward. Even if the Senate is able to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto, it would be all for naught if the House Republicans are working in the exact opposite direction.

“There would be a few [Republicans voting against the president], but nowhere near the 55 threshold,” said Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill. “Absolutely not.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not hide his caucus’ displeasure on Tuesday after meeting with Trump administration officials about the tariffs. On Wednesday in an interview with Fox News, he professed a ""lack of enthusiasm among Senate Republican for what would amount to a tax increase, frankly, on working class people.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has acknowledged that his caucus shares the Senate GOP’s concern over the Mexico tariffs. But the California Republican has taken an entirely differently approach to the situation.

The GOP leader is not only urging his members to rally around the president, but he is even turning his fire on his Senate colleagues for undermining Trump.

“We should empower the president to be able to have a strong hand in negotiation,” McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. “If members here were undercutting him, it only hurts.”

“We should be united so there won’t be tariffs,” he added.

And it’s clear that Trump feels like McCarthy is in his corner. The president appeared to erroneously attribute a quote to McCarthy on Twitter that offered a far stronger defense of Trump than what McCarthy has actually said. McCarthy, however, did not push back.

The different approaches within the House and Senate GOP reflect a broader contrast with how Republicans in each chamber have dealt with Trump as well as their different incentives.

House Republicans have been far more reluctant to publicly rebuke the president than their Senate colleagues. Representatives are elected every two years, and those worried about job security have less room to maneuver politically. Most of them are more concerned about pro-Trump primary challengers rather than a Democrat in a general election.

“Republicans are primarily free-traders. Trump is obviously tariffing a lot of things, it’s hurting some of our producers, some of our manufacturers,” said Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.). “But he’s also well-loved in many districts. So it will be a tough vote for some folks... We struggle with this tariff issue.”

Senators, who serve six-year terms and represent entire states, seem to have far fewer reservations about panning Trump’s tariffs or going after him on other matters as well. And harsh tariffs on Mexico are far more alarming than the steel and aluminum tariffs on allies that Republicans have already repeatedly threatened to block.

“I’m not for the tariffs,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). The number of Republicans in opposition “is significant.”

“Tariffs are not the right way to go and there’s no reason that millions of farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses in Texas should pay the price and face billions in additional taxes,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

At the Tuesday lunch with administration officials, no senator spoke in support of the president’s position. But that doesn’t mean Senate Republicans are united. Far from it.

Some Senate Republicans are disappointed their colleagues are resorting to such public warnings. They feel that the president has tried everything he can on Mexico, with no help from Congress, so that panning the tariffs does little to make positive change.

“I understand what the president is trying to do, and I understand where he’s coming from. I would say to my colleagues and others: ‘If you have a better idea, fantastic,'"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).

For McConnell and his deputies, the divergent views in the caucus makes for an awkward spot. Like McCarthy, they know their leadership roles mean they generally must be supportive of the president.

McCarthy, who has faced challenges from the conservative Freedom Caucus and could face a leadership fight one day from Minority Whip Steve Scalise, has clung particularly close to Trump.

But it's clear Republican leaders don't like the tariffs either. And the last thing they want to do is referee another intraparty feud about the president's unilateral actions on the border as the primary season draws ever closer for their members.

""The message was pretty clear coming out of the lunch that there are a lot of concerns about it,"" said GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the party whip. ""Hopefully we'll see coming out of the next couple of days whether or not this idea can be turned off.""

President Donald Trump’s threats to impose blunt new tariffs on Mexico has unleashed a circular firing squad among Republicans in Congress.

A bloc of Senate Republicans is threatening to put up a veto-proof majority to block the tariffs if Trump moves forward by using his national emergency powers. But most House Republicans and another faction of GOP senators say their colleagues are making a mistake by undercutting the president on one of his signature issues.

“I’m disappointed that so many of my colleagues are quick to announce their opposition,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “By so publicly rebuking the president's strategy you undermine the very leverage that could end this thing quickly. That's the irony to me.""

The public split not only risks embarrassing the president and his party. It undercuts the shared goal Republicans have in avoiding the tariffs that Trump seems eager to deploy.

At issue is a conflict over strategy. Some GOP lawmakers hope to pressure Trump with the prospect of a rebellion that far exceeds the dozen defections on his national emergency declaration this winter, while others argue for a quieter persuasion campaign.

The dual approaches are scrambling ideologies and voting blocs on Capitol Hill. Take Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), both up for reelection in red-hued states but who have far different conclusions about the president's tactics.

“I’m not in favor of this. The president needs to rethink it,” warned Ernst, who backed Trump’s national emergency on the border. “The president needs to understand that we’re opposed to these tariffs.

House Democrats' DREAM Act will ""probably not"" get a vote in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday.

The Kentucky Republican's rejection of the legislation that would give a path to citizenship to immigrants brought to the United States as children is just the latest example of the Senate Republican majority sidelining House-passed legislation. McConnell said that he would want to see a broader approach on immigration before the Senate would take it up.

The House passed its bill on Wednesday, the most significant immigration bill to pass a chamber of Congress in six years.

""The Dreamers have a sympathetic case. There are circumstances under which I and others would be happy to support that. But we need to do more than that. You know there's some genuine fixes on the legal immigration side and on the illegal immigration side that need to be addressed,"" McConnell said on Fox News Radio. ""There is a perfectly legitimate case for the Dreamers ... but I think we need to do more than just that. And that's the context in which I would deal with that issue in the Senate.

The Senate failed to pass an immigration deal last year after a short debate, with most Republicans opposing a bill aiding Dreamers and providing $25 billion in border security and scant support for President Donald Trump's immigration plan either. Since passing a comprehensive bill in 2013 that the House ignored, the Senate has sputtered in its immigration debates despite broad agreement that Congress has failed to address the problem.

McConnell blamed Democrats for not acting when they had total control of the government in 2009-10, though two recent years of total Republican rule were no more fruitful. The administration also opposes the House Democrats' bill.

""Immigration is an area that there is bipartisan responsibility for failure to act,"" McConnell said.

The majority leader has also declined to take up House-passed bills addressing ethics and corruption and gun background checks, leading to a bicameral Democratic campaign against his ""legislative graveyard.""

Stephanie Murphy said in an interview on the Dreamers bill on Tuesday. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images congress Centrists warn of 'slippery slope' after Democrats skirt rules to fund agenda

A group of moderates is calling out House Democratic leaders for blowing past the caucus’s own budget rules to pay for its agenda, a sign of strain among the resurgent fiscal-hawk wing of the party.

The Blue Dog Coalition sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Wednesday urging them to “keep the fiscal house in order” after failing to find a way to pay for a landmark bill to protect so-called Dreamers earlier this week.

Story Continued Below

The letter, which was signed by 20 members and obtained by POLITICO, is a warning shot to House Democrats against ignoring the caucus’ self-imposed fiscal restraints, known as Pay-As-You-Go — which the Blue Dog Coalition had worked to secure earlier this year.

“We urge you, in the spirit of the House rules, to only advance legislation that is fully paid for,” the group wrote.

The moderates’ stand comes one day after House Democrats overwhelmingly agreed to waive the rule, known as PAYGO, to pass a bill to protect young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers.

That bill cost roughly $35 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, largely because millions of people would be added to government-run services like Obamacare subsidies, Medicaid or food stamps.

“Obviously we have concerns about waiving PAYGO, and certainly, we hope that this is not a slippery slope,” Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) said in an interview on the Dreamers bill on Tuesday.

Murphy, one of the Blue Dog co-chairs, did not mention the Dreamers bill in the letter, which she wrote with Reps. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) and Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz), her fellow co-chairs.

But the Blue Dog leaders had been working behind the scenes with Pelosi and her deputies earlier this week as they tried to find an 11th-hour solution to pay for the bill.

The group raised concerns with the $35 billion price tag — which was made public during the Memorial Day recess — in its meeting on Monday, and brought up the issues with Democratic leaders.

Democrats involved in those talks debated privately whether to fund the bill through a tax hike, though the idea was quickly rebuked, according to multiple lawmakers and aides.

Ultimately, a group of Democratic leaders agreed to waive PAYGO in a closed-door meeting in Pelosi’s office on Monday, according to multiple sources. The full House voted to do so on Tuesday, with just nine members, mostly freshmen in competitive districts, opposed.

House Democrats agreed to reinstate PAYGO when they retook the majority in January, to the dismay of many progressives, who saw it as hindering an ambitious agenda.

Both Democrats and Republicans have enforced the rule in the past, and both parties have also agreed to waive it liberally. Both GOP-controlled chambers agreed to skirt the budget rule in 2017 to pass the Trump administration's signature tax cuts.

The budget rule is certain to flare up in the coming months for the Democratic agenda, with progressive leaders pressing for votes on bills like paid family leave and Medicare for All.

Blue Dogs, who nearly tripled their membership after the 2018 elections and now have 27 members, have vowed to hold Democrats accountable in following the rule.","“Obviously we have concerns about waiving PAYGO, and certainly, we hope that this is not a slippery slope,” Rep.

201,Dems clash over funding for Trump's migrant crisis,Sarah Ferris,"“There’s got to be guard rails around any money so that it’s used for humanitarian relief, and it’s not diverted toward Trump’s deportation machine,” Rep. Joaquin Castro said in an interview. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images congress Dems clash over funding for Trump's migrant crisis

House Democratic leaders are facing sharp pushback from rank-and-file members on plans to deliver billions of dollars to ease the migrant crisis at the southern border, threatening to drag out another border funding fight with President Donald Trump.

Leaders of several groups, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, have told top Democrats they oppose sending Trump even one more dollar for the border without a slew of strict conditions — complicating any deal with Republicans.

Story Continued Below

But Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her deputies are under intense pressure to deliver money before the Fourth of July recess in order to avoid being accused of starving the government's refugee programs. It’s forced Democrats into another agonizing debate on immigration that could expose simmering tensions across the caucus.

The president in early May asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency aid to address the influx of Central American migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including $3.3 billion for humanitarian assistance.

Democratic spending leaders have said any funding would be limited to humanitarian aid, mostly for families and unaccompanied minors. But a majority of the Hispanic Caucus 38 members said they are deeply skeptical that the Trump administration would use the funds for the humanitarian crisis instead of enforcing the White House's border policies and still want the House to take a harder line against Trump.

“There’s got to be guard rails around any money so that it’s used for humanitarian relief and it’s not diverted toward Trump’s deportation machine,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in an interview.

Pelosi’s team is working with the CHC to resolve the border issues, with the aim of passing a bill this month. Leadership staff has planned a meeting with CHC staff for Wednesday afternoon, according to multiple sources.

Castro met this week with Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the No. 4 House Democrat, and House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and plans to sit down with Pelosi before a floor vote, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus members have also asked to hear directly from officials who would be responsible for the money, chiefly, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

One of the biggest hurdles for Democratic leaders is convincing CHC members the Trump administration actually needs the money.

“That supplemental is a political accommodation,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, a border state Democrat, who said he sees no rush to deliver money to Trump’s border officials.

Grijalva said he and other Democrats have worked to halt the funding package, which he called a “Christmas tree of enforcement provisions” for the White House.

House Democratic leaders, however, say they take the Trump administration at its word about the growing sense of desperation at detention facilities on the border. “We assume they are being forthright,” one Democratic aide said.

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), a border state lawmaker who sits on the House Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, said he feels pressured to deliver cash as nonprofits and churches along the border are forced to provide assistance to migrant families to make up the gap in services.

But he said some Democrats have balked at sending money because they fear it would go to Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In my opinion, we do have to come up with some money,” Cuellar said. “But we’ve got to convince our more progressive friends that this is not ICE, this is not deportation, this is to take care of kids.”

Cuellar, a CHC member, is an exception within the caucus. Most members of the Hispanic Caucus said they won’t agree to a plan unless it includes strict rules for the White House’s policies, particularly on shelters for undocumented minors, which they fear could be turned into long-term detention facilities.

""There is some fear that if the [Office of Refugee and Resettlement] ramped up their beds, will they also try to keep kids in detention longer?"" one Democratic aide familiar with discussions said.

Some CHC members argue that Congress already handed billions to the White House for border issues just four months ago, though appropriators point out that money went to a different program that can’t be used for unaccompanied minors.

This week, leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the CHC and the Congressional Asian and Pacific Islander Caucus began circulating a letter urging appropriators to cut funding for immigration detention facilities for the upcoming fiscal year.

“It is past time for Congress to hold DHS accountable,” they wrote in the letter — obtained by POLITICO — condemning ICE’s “rapid detention expansion” and its decision to flout Congress’ prior funding restrictions.

The White House's border funding request was left out of an earlier disaster aid package the House approved Monday because of an impasse over Trump's immigration policies. Democrats said they had already ruled out funding for more detention beds, but both parties got stuck on an issue that would allow agencies to share data on undocumented migrants — language that Democrats, including the CHC, have opposed.

Pressure is likely to mount as border crossings continue to surge this summer. Already, White House officials argue they’re running out of cash for the program that cares for unaccompanied migrants. Without action, they said salaries would be cut and social services would be curtailed.

“There is a backlog with the children right now because [Health and Human Services] is struggling with their bed capacity,” Mark Morgan, recently installed as acting director at ICE, told reporters this week. ""Think about that: We are begging. We are asking Congress to please help us.”

202,Dems clash over funding for Trump's migrant crisis,Ted Hesson,"“There’s got to be guard rails around any money so that it’s used for humanitarian relief, and it’s not diverted toward Trump’s deportation machine,” Rep. Joaquin Castro said in an interview. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images congress Dems clash over funding for Trump's migrant crisis

House Democratic leaders are facing sharp pushback from rank-and-file members on plans to deliver billions of dollars to ease the migrant crisis at the southern border, threatening to drag out another border funding fight with President Donald Trump.

Leaders of several groups, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, have told top Democrats they oppose sending Trump even one more dollar for the border without a slew of strict conditions — complicating any deal with Republicans.

But Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her deputies are under intense pressure to deliver money before the Fourth of July recess in order to avoid being accused of starving the government's refugee programs. It’s forced Democrats into another agonizing debate on immigration that could expose simmering tensions across the caucus.

The president in early May asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency aid to address the influx of Central American migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including $3.3 billion for humanitarian assistance.

Democratic spending leaders have said any funding would be limited to humanitarian aid, mostly for families and unaccompanied minors. But a majority of the Hispanic Caucus 38 members said they are deeply skeptical that the Trump administration would use the funds for the humanitarian crisis instead of enforcing the White House's border policies and still want the House to take a harder line against Trump.

“There’s got to be guard rails around any money so that it’s used for humanitarian relief and it’s not diverted toward Trump’s deportation machine,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in an interview.

Pelosi’s team is working with the CHC to resolve the border issues, with the aim of passing a bill this month. Leadership staff has planned a meeting with CHC staff for Wednesday afternoon, according to multiple sources.

Castro met this week with Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the No. 4 House Democrat, and House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and plans to sit down with Pelosi before a floor vote, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus members have also asked to hear directly from officials who would be responsible for the money, chiefly, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

One of the biggest hurdles for Democratic leaders is convincing CHC members the Trump administration actually needs the money.

“That supplemental is a political accommodation,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, a border state Democrat, who said he sees no rush to deliver money to Trump’s border officials.

Grijalva said he and other Democrats have worked to halt the funding package, which he called a “Christmas tree of enforcement provisions” for the White House.

House Democratic leaders, however, say they take the Trump administration at its word about the growing sense of desperation at detention facilities on the border. “We assume they are being forthright,” one Democratic aide said.

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), a border state lawmaker who sits on the House Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, said he feels pressured to deliver cash as nonprofits and churches along the border are forced to provide assistance to migrant families to make up the gap in services.

But he said some Democrats have balked at sending money because they fear it would go to Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In my opinion, we do have to come up with some money,” Cuellar said. “But we’ve got to convince our more progressive friends that this is not ICE, this is not deportation, this is to take care of kids.”

Cuellar, a CHC member, is an exception within the caucus. Most members of the Hispanic Caucus said they won’t agree to a plan unless it includes strict rules for the White House’s policies, particularly on shelters for undocumented minors, which they fear could be turned into long-term detention facilities.

""There is some fear that if the [Office of Refugee and Resettlement] ramped up their beds, will they also try to keep kids in detention longer?"" one Democratic aide familiar with discussions said.

Some CHC members argue that Congress already handed billions to the White House for border issues just four months ago, though appropriators point out that money went to a different program that can’t be used for unaccompanied minors.

Pete Buttigieg said on Thursday that Stacey Abrams was robbed of the governorship of Georgia, blaming voter suppression for her narrow loss last year.

“Stacey Abrams ought to be the governor of Georgia,” Buttigieg said to applause at the Democratic National Committee’s African American Leadership Summit in Atlanta.

“When racially motivated voter suppression is permitted, when districts are drawn so that politicians get to choose their voters instead of the other way around, when money is allowed to outvote people in this country, we cannot truly say we live in a democracy,” he continued.

Abrams, who lost to Republican Brian Kemp, was edged out by fewer than 55,000 votes, but still made history as the first African American woman to secure the Democratic nomination for governor.

She has since maintained a high public profile, delivering the Democratic response to the State of the Union address in February and openly flirting with a 2020 presidential run.

She has also been courted by the current Democratic White House contenders. Both Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke were expected to meet privately with Abrams on the sidelines of the leadership summit this week.

Buttigieg’s appearance at the summit is part of an effort to boost his standing with black voters. In a recent poll, the South Bend mayor only won 2 percent of the support of black voters, a key part of the Democratic base. He has publicly acknowledged that he needs to do more to win over African Americans, and he’s pledged to build a campaign team that reflects the country’s diversity.

214,2020 Dems have widespread practice of lifting policy material,Natasha Korecki,"Plagiarism is an especially sensitive subject for Joe Biden, since it served as a reminder of a scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential campaign. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images 2020 elections 2020 Dems have widespread practice of lifting policy material It's not just Biden. The 2020 campaigns are well-practiced in the art of cribbing material from other websites.

Twenty-four hours after Joe Biden’s campaign was taken to task for lifting portions of a climate change plan without citation, it’s clear that the former vice president has plenty of company.

A sampling of policy proposals from Biden’s leading rivals suggests the lifting of direct text from academic papers, think tanks or policy institutes — and the cribbing of facts without attribution — is fairly widespread on 2020 campaign websites.

Story Continued Below

A POLITICO review found previously published material on the official campaign websites of Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, as well as frequent use of facts and data without citation on a number of others.

""More than 1 million women in America today have been shot or shot at by an intimate partner,“ Harris writes under the gender equality section of her website.

Everytown, the gun safety group, has a remarkably similar line on its own site, with one minor difference in scale: “Nearly 1 million women alive today have been shot, or shot at, by an intimate partner.""

Harris’ website also notes that “Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.“

That language is identical to phrasing found on the American Heart Association website — minus the attribution: ""Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""

Those usage practices aren’t much different than the ones that tripped up Biden Tuesday, when the first reports surfaced identifying a number of questionable passages in Biden’s $1.7 trillion climate plan .

In one instance, the Biden plan text contained the same language about technology designed to capture and store power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions as documents previously released by the nongovernmental organization Center for Climate and Energy Solutions as well as the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of environmental and labor groups.

“Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22 page document,” the Biden campaign acknowledged. “As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”

The issue is especially sensitive for Biden, since it served as a reminder of a plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential campaign. Then, it was revealed that Biden had recited lines of a speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, adopting some of the narrative as his own.

But for other campaigns, the issue doesn’t carry nearly as much resonance — and it’s reflected in the lax attribution standards.

In the voting rights section of former Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s website, the language echoes President Barack Obama. “Americans should not have to jump through hoops to exercise their fundamental right to vote,” the text reads.

Obama had used a similar metaphor in 2014 when he said that “no citizen, including our servicemembers, should have to jump through hoops to exercise their most fundamental right.”

In a Medium post in March, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker lamented that “the punishing reality is that there are more African American men under criminal supervision today than there were enslaved in 1850” — an idea expressed in a Vox headline when singer John Legend raised it in a 2015 Oscar speech.

The actual source of the factoid appears to be Michelle Alexander, the author of the 2010 book “The New Jim Crow” and the subject of a piece titled “ More Black Men Are In Prison Today Than Were Enslaved In 1850 .”

Echoing Biden’s campaign, the campaigns contacted for this story insisted that the examples weren’t instances of plagiarism or inappropriate lifting as much as the citing of data that are relatively well-known among activists.

“These are statistics,” Harris spokesman Ian Sams said.

Indeed, Everytown sounded a note of gratitude for Harris’ use of its gun stats, even though the group wasn’t cited.

“Everytown makes resources about gun safety public so that all Americans can use them,” spokeswoman Stacey Radnor said. “We are thrilled to see candidates base their gun safety platforms on research and facts to bring attention to our nation's gun violence crisis that kills 100 Americans and wounds hundreds more every day.”

In the case of O’Rourke’s use of language similar to President Obama’s, spokesman Chris Evans noted that the expression “‘jump through hoops‘ is a common idiom.”

“As much as we admire President Obama, we didn't pull up an arbitrary 2014 statement of his from the archives while creating our historic voting rights plan nearly five years later,” Evans said. “Voting is a fundamental right because it's enshrined in the Constitution and has been fought for by Americans across our country in the centuries that followed.”

Deborah R. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and expert in copyright and plagiarism , said she saw no transgressions by the candidates in any of the above examples. She said context matters, and it’s clear that the candidates, including Biden, are relying on other people’s facts and not pretending that a unique expression of someone else’s work is their own.

“I don’t consider this plagiarism. I don’t see them saying, ‘This is my data’,” Gerhardt said.

That’s what Sanders appears to have done in at least one situation.

“Fundamental change in America’s agricultural and rural policies is no longer just an option; it’s an absolute necessity,” Sanders says on his website, in an issues statement on “Revitalizing Rural America” that he rolled out earlier this year.

That language is nearly identical to a line that appears in an obscure academic paper on organic farming first presented in 2014 and archived on the web in 2018.

“Fundamental change is no longer just an option; it is an absolute necessity,” wrote John Ikerd, a professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri.

There’s a reason for the similar phrasing, however: According to the campaign, Ikerd wrote the early draft of Sanders’ policy.

The 2020 campaigns are well-practiced in the art of cribbing material from other websites.

Twenty-four hours after Joe Biden’s campaign was taken to task for lifting portions of a climate change plan without citation, it’s clear that the former vice president has plenty of company.

A sampling of policy proposals from Biden’s leading rivals suggests the lifting of direct text from academic papers, think tanks or policy institutes — and the cribbing of facts without attribution — is fairly widespread on 2020 campaign websites.

A POLITICO review found previously published material on the official campaign websites of Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, as well as frequent use of facts and data without citation on a number of others.

""More than 1 million women in America today have been shot or shot at by an intimate partner,“ Harris writes under the gender equality section of her website.

Everytown, the gun safety group, has a remarkably similar line on its own site, with one minor difference in scale: “Nearly 1 million women alive today have been shot, or shot at, by an intimate partner.""

Harris’ website also notes that “Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.“

That language is identical to phrasing found on the American Heart Association website — minus the attribution: ""Black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""

Those usage practices aren’t much different than the ones that tripped up Biden Tuesday, when the first reports surfaced identifying a number of questionable passages in Biden’s $1.7 trillion climate plan .

In one instance, the Biden plan text contained the same language about technology designed to capture and store power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions as documents previously released by the nongovernmental organization Center for Climate and Energy Solutions as well as the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of environmental and labor groups.

“Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22 page document,” the Biden campaign acknowledged. “As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”

The issue is especially sensitive for Biden, since it served as a reminder of a plagiarism scandal that derailed his 1988 presidential campaign. Then, it was revealed that Biden had recited lines of a speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, adopting some of the narrative as his own.

But for other campaigns, the issue doesn’t carry nearly as much resonance — and it’s reflected in the lax attribution standards.

In the voting rights section of former Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s website, the language echoes President Barack Obama. “Americans should not have to jump through hoops to exercise their fundamental right to vote,” the text reads.

Obama had used a similar metaphor in 2014 when he said that “no citizen, including our servicemembers, should have to jump through hoops to exercise their most fundamental right.”

In a Medium post in March, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker lamented that “the punishing reality is that there are more African American men under criminal supervision today than there were enslaved in 1850” — an idea expressed in a Vox headline when singer John Legend raised it in a 2015 Oscar speech.

The actual source of the factoid appears to be Michelle Alexander, the author of the 2010 book “The New Jim Crow” and the subject of a piece titled “ More Black Men Are In Prison Today Than Were Enslaved In 1850 .”

Echoing Biden’s campaign, the campaigns contacted for this story insisted that the examples weren’t instances of plagiarism or inappropriate lifting as much as the citing of data that are relatively well-known among activists.

“These are statistics,” Harris spokesman Ian Sams said.

216,"DNC opts against climate change debate, Inslee says",Anthony Adragna,"Mark Lennihan/AP Photo 2020 elections DNC opts against climate change debate, Inslee says

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Wednesday the Democratic National Committee informed him it will not dedicate one of its presidential primary debates to the issue of climate change.

The decision comes despite a furious push from progressive and environmental advocates for a climate change debate, as well as strong support across the Democratic ideological spectrum. At least half a dozen Democratic candidates, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and former Obama cabinet official Julián Castro, have backed the idea.

Inslee, who led the push among presidential candidates and has made climate change the centerpiece of his campaign, called the decision “deeply disappointing” and out of step with Democratic primary voters. He also said the organization threatened not to invite him to future debates if he participated in any other climate change debate.

“The DNC is silencing the voices of Democratic activists, many of our progressive partner organizations, and nearly half of the Democratic presidential field who want to debate the existential crisis of our time,” Inslee said in a statement. “The climate crisis merits a full discussion of our plans, not a short exchange of talking points.”

Inslee continues to roll out policies outlining his plans for combating climate change. On Wednesday, he unveiled his strategy for international engagement on the issue, which emphasizes rejoining a host of international climate pacts beyond just the Paris accord; applying stronger climate requirements for trade agreements and ending fossil fuel subsidies around the world.

In a statement, the DNC said climate change would remain a top priority during the debates but that it hoped to ensure “vigorous discussion” on all important issues to voters like the economy, climate change and health care.

“While climate change is at the top of our list, the DNC will not be holding entire debates on a single issue area because we want to make sure voters have the ability to hear from candidates on dozens of issues of importance to American voters,” the DNC said.

Progressive organizations like the Sunrise Movement, which has led the push for a Green New Deal to decarbonize the U.S., slammed the decision, as did other environmental advocates.

“This is an outrage,” the Sunrise Movement said in a tweet. “This is an emergency. We need @TheDemocrats to act like it.”

The Sierra Club and Tom Steyer’s NextGen America also urged the DNC to reconsider.

“This is a deeply disappointing decision,” the Sierra Club said in a tweet. “Democratic candidates are offering strong, bold climate plans that contrast sharply with Trump’s inaction & the public deserves to hear them discussed in depth.”","Mark Lennihan/AP Photo 2020 elections DNC opts against climate change debate, Inslee saysWashington Gov.

A battle of the brains is underway in the Democratic 2020 primary.

Former Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren and Harvard grad Pete Buttigieg are front-runners for the affection of well-educated liberals — an influential slice of the Democratic electorate with the capacity to provide a big boost in a crowded field.

Story Continued Below

Warren and Buttigieg have thrived in the early months of the race by running as candidates of the thinking person vying to take out an anti-intellectual president. And their targeted audience has taken notice: Polls show disproportionate numbers of Warren and Buttigieg supporters are college-educated Democrats.

But their tactics are radically different. Warren rolls out policies at a relentless clip, embracing her inner wonk and bragging that she “has a plan for that.” At a recent CNN town hall, the Massachusetts senator was asked whether she preferred teaching law students or serving in the Senate. “Oh, teaching, are you kidding?” she responded.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, flaunts his fluency in Norwegian, talks about his love of James Joyce and effortlessly analyzes John Rawls. Though he also describes himself as a wonk, Buttigieg rarely goes into detail on policy, instead showing off his ability to explain and synthesize complicated topics.

“Donald Trump has set the bar so low and I think there’s a real thirst for the exact opposite of him,” said Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic activist and former gubernatorial candidate in Michigan who knows both candidates.

Of course, past Democratic presidential primaries are littered with failed candidates who appealed to liberal elites — Paul Tsongas in 1992, Bill Bradley in 2000 and Howard Dean in 2004. Swiss cheese-eating John Kerry managed to clinch the nomination in 2004, only to fall to regular guy George W. Bush in the general.

But in a crowded primary, winning the well-educated lane would be no minor feat. Indeed, behind the enthusiastic wonkery of Warren and Buttigieg is a clear-eyed political calculation. Highly educated voters tend to be more politically active and more likely to donate money to candidates. They also turn out to vote at higher rates than other constituencies.

Then there's the sheer number of votes up for grabs: According to a CNN analysis of exit poll data from the 2016 Democratic primaries, 53 percent Democratic voters had college degrees, up from 46 percent in 2008.

""In a race with so many candidates, people are looking for what there is to distinguish one candidate from another,"" Richard Cordray, the former Democratic nominee for governor in Ohio and an ally of Warren, said of the efforts by the two candidates to woo highly educated voters.

Polls reflect how the Ivy League approach is playing with voters. A Morning Consult survey this week found that Warren's most enthusiastic backers are voters with a bachelor’s or post-graduate degree. The same poll found that Buttigieg fares better among people with that level of education than those with some or no college education.

According to a Monmouth poll in late May, among college graduates, Warren polled ahead of every Democrat except Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who enjoy extremely high name identification. Buttigieg also performed well among that group.

Warren and Buttigieg have some of the most impressive educational backgrounds in the Democratic primary field. Buttigieg graduated from Harvard and then was a Rhodes scholar. Warren was an accomplished academic and lawyer who went on to teach at Harvard Law School.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/3429/1155968404_6033867964001_6033870028001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

On the campaign trail, neither shies away from their Ivy League credentials or intellectual bearing. But that may be where the similarities end.

Warren is “someone who really has done her homework and someone who has robust and deeply considered positions,” said Dan Kanninen, an unaffiliated Democratic strategist. And Buttigieg ""comes across as someone with the preternatural talent for both connecting the dots on issues and policies.

""I think the perception is that his intelligence is that he can get to the simplest explanation that makes sense to people to describe very complicated problems.""

Warren eagerly plays the professor during town hall events, breaking down her policies in easy-to-understand prose. She often tells voters that she’s about to “nerd out” before diving into the weeds.

Warren’s campaign has taken her policy-centric approach to places not typically associated with ivory towers. She visited Kermit, W. Va., a town ravaged by opioid addiction, shortly after rolling out her plan to fight the painkiller epidemic. On a swing through the Mississippi Delta, a region that’s struggled with a high poverty rate, she delved into her plan to make housing more affordable.

The online calculator featured on Warren's campaign website calculating how much college debt her plan would eliminate has been used by 250,000 people.

Buttigieg also isn't afraid to exhibit his intellect. He'll seamlessly slip in asides in the multiple languages he speaks one minute, then draw from law review articles the next to explain why he would add seats to the Supreme Court.

Responding to criticism that Buttigieg has been light on specifics, his team has quietly added policy positions to his campaign website. And the South Bend, Ind., mayor is talking increasingly about his ideas on the trail.

""Substance is very appealing in this day and age. People are very hungry for that,"" Cordray said.

218,Trump’s method to the madness on trade,John F. Harris,"President Donald Trump said tariffs on Mexican goods will ""likely"" go into effect during a news conference in the United Kingdom. | Stefan Rousseau/Getty Images) Global Translations Trump’s method to the madness on trade Lost in the tweets and partisan fights is a belief that a bet on freer trade has proved to be a loser.

Donald Trump is not winging it.

Or at least he’s not totally winging it.

Story Continued Below

However improvisational his daily machinations on trade — presenting publicly as motivated by a random mix of mood and twitches of the news cycle, including the latest threat of tariffs against Mexico — Trump and his team are acting on a well-developed theory of the case, one that has been decades in the making.

In Trump’s case, that strategy is intuitive. He’s been saying since the 1980s — and by all evidence genuinely believes — that the United States is letting itself be played for the fool by foreign adversaries, on trade specifically and global competition generally. Strong nations robustly protect domestic industries and keep foreign competitors at heel. Back in the ’80s his focus was more typically Japan; in recent years, but long before 2016, he’s been focused on China.

In the case of his advisers, the theory of the case is more intellectual. They believe that the big bet free trade advocates made in the 1990s — that welcoming China into the WTO would encourage it to integrate into a rules-based global economy — has proved to be a loser. China, by these lights, is happy to take advantage of the U.S. and other players’ commitment to free trade and rules but will continue to steal and subsidize to advance its own interests.

This method to the apparent madness has emerged in interviews for the new Global Translations podcast — which launched Thursday — with people who have worked for Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

“I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us,” said Michael Pillsbury, an influential adviser to the Trump administration on China and author of the book, “The Hundred Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.”

“I finally woke up,” he said. “But I would not say everybody's awakened even at this point.”

The Trump doctrine marks a repudiation of decades of U.S. trade orthodoxy — that reached its high point in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, and capitalism and liberalism appeared on the march. This “End of History” euphoria culminated in Clinton pushing past his party’s populist instincts on trade and embracing the elite view that the world was becoming more integrated, more rules-based, and more prosperous, and that this meant good things both for American and the rest of humanity.

In 1993, he signed into law NAFTA, which had been negotiated by the Bush administration, and enabled China’s accession into the WTO, stating in a 2000 speech: “By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.”

That democratic dream now appears dead — and with it American patience to wait for China to reform itself.

The China hawks in the White House believe now is the best — and perhaps last — moment for the U.S. to take dramatic economic action against China, even at the cost of roiling markets and upending a strong U.S. economy.

And they have tethered the rest of U.S. trade policy — demands of Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan — to an aggressive agenda of increasingly squeezing China out of global supply chains while pressing for structural change in Beijing. When U.S. business leaders have warned, cajoled, and pleaded about the economic risks of a trade war, they have been rebuffed with the argument that it is precisely the strong economy that has wedged open a historic window of opportunity to make the move.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has described China as an “existential problem,” wants to use U.S. economic leverage to demand serious structural changes in China — while the U.S. still has that leverage.

The urgency behind the strategy concerns technology: China’s attempts to supercharge the growth of nascent tech industries by subsidizing them and forcing the handover of U.S. intellectual property. The goal is to leapfrog from its past status as a developing nation exporting cheap plastic wares to a leader in strategic emerging technologies that will define the next technological age — such as 5G and the next-generation internet, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

China has copied U.S. technology, sometimes by requiring joint ventures and the sharing of intellectual property and other times by outright theft. The end of these forced technological transfers is Lighthizer’s central aim — even if they mean that soybean farmers will pay the price. If America fails to do so and becomes “number two in technology,” he told a congressional hearing in February, “then the world is going to look very different for our children.”

Pillsbury, the Trump adviser, said the administration fears not only losing a commercial rivalry — but enabling an Orwellian future in which an authoritarian Beijing controls global surveillance, directs online speech and embeds government control into the very plumbing of the internet.

“Their idea is the whole world will have this combination of [surveillance] cameras, your shopping patterns, what magazines you subscribe to, who your friends are, where you go based on your cell phone being geolocated,” with the aim of creating a social credit score, he said. “To what degree do you support the Communist Party of China? Have you ever criticized anything? And then when you apply to get a loan or to go to college or to do anything, your social credit score will tell how the government’s going to treat you.”

“Everybody in the world will be under this kind of system,” Pillsbury said of the authoritarian vision of the future.

Increasingly, the U.S. military is concerned, too. The 2018 national security strategy, signed by former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, asserts that China seeks “regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.”

This big picture explains in part why the Trump administration has been willing to wrest open trade relations with allies in order to remake the terms of global trade — it’s not just about a better bilateral deal for the U.S., but about a particular approach to China. Take the steel tariffs against Canada and Mexico that were aimed at “closing the back door” to subsidized steel from China, among other places; and the insertion of language in the new North American agreement that would expel a country from the agreement if it entered into a free trade agreement with a “non-market economy,” or new requirements aimed at reducing the share of Chinese parts in North America car production. Likewise, the administration will have China in mind as it opens talks with Japan and Europe.

In Trumpland, the long-term goals apparently outweigh the short-term chaos and pain.

Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, recalled a meeting with senior Trump administration officials and groups representing industries affected by tariffs, who argued that the economic effects of Trump’s economic policies would be undone by a trade war. “It was really one of the most brilliant presentations I’ve ever seen — PowerPoint graphics, the whole thing — that said, ‘If you do this, administration, if you do what you're talking about doing on trade,” he recalled, “you’re going to take back all the economic gains you’ve made from tax reform.”

“And everybody thought it was a mic drop moment, right? Aha! And everybody in the administration kind of looked at each other and said, ‘We know. You think we don't know that?’”

Over two decades, 9/11, the wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis and recovery, made action too difficult, according to Ujczo — and the possibility of a next recession could close the window. “If we don’t do this now, when will we ever do this? It’s really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right.”

While Democrats don’t agree with all of Trump’s tactics, long-standing concerns about China have been bipartisan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was an early opponent of China’s entry into the WTO. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has long decried Chinese currency manipulation. Schumer recently tweeted, “Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”

The Obama administration shared concerns about Chinese subsidies and technological theft but attempted to address them by negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a new agreement with 11 other nations. The idea was to encircle China by creating a free-trade zone with its neighbors and set high standards that China would eventually have to accept in order to join. In trying to sell the deal to a skeptical public in 2015, Obama said China had been “putting out feelers” about eventually joining the pact.

But the agreement lacked public and Congressional support amid a backlash against globalization. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement after he was elected and has opted instead for an increasingly bilateral approach to confronting China — using threats, tariffs and negotiations with other nations as a way to influence China. In many ways, it was the administration’s firmest rebuke of the international coalition-building approach of Republican and Democratic administrations that preceded it.

While critics of the TPP said it wasn’t enough to force structural changes in China, supporters say Trump gave up a powerful tool.

“I think [it] is perhaps the most significant strategic blunder in recent American history,” said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative under Obama. “We’ve lost that position for the United States at least for now, and we have created a void, a vacuum that China is quite effectively filling at the moment.”

Trump’s agenda doesn’t necessarily mean an end to trade. But it does mean surrendering faith in gauzy principles and far-reaching trade protocols. Instead, go toe-to-toe with trade competitors at times and in sectors of one’s own choosing — and know that adversaries won’t respect you unless you prove on occasion that you are willing to inflict pain on others (and accept it yourself) to win a conflict.

And it leaves open the possibility that the confrontation with China could embolden hawks on both sides.

“Over the next year or two we're going to find out — can we have a trade deal? Can we have some kind of reconciliation with China?” said Pillsbury. “Or… are we moving toward a new Cold War relationship?”","| Stefan Rousseau/Getty Images) Global Translations Trump’s method to the madness on trade Lost in the tweets and partisan fights is a belief that a bet on freer trade has proved to be a loser.

Or at least he’s not totally winging it.

However improvisational his daily machinations on trade — presenting publicly as motivated by a random mix of mood and twitches of the news cycle, including the latest threat of tariffs against Mexico — Trump and his team are acting on a well-developed theory of the case, one that has been decades in the making.

In Trump’s case, that strategy is intuitive. He’s been saying since the 1980s — and by all evidence genuinely believes — that the United States is letting itself be played for the fool by foreign adversaries, on trade specifically and global competition generally. Strong nations robustly protect domestic industries and keep foreign competitors at heel. Back in the ’80s his focus was more typically Japan; in recent years, but long before 2016, he’s been focused on China.

In the case of his advisers, the theory of the case is more intellectual. They believe that the big bet free trade advocates made in the 1990s — that welcoming China into the WTO would encourage it to integrate into a rules-based global economy — has proved to be a loser. China, by these lights, is happy to take advantage of the U.S. and other players’ commitment to free trade and rules but will continue to steal and subsidize to advance its own interests.

This method to the apparent madness has emerged in interviews for the new Global Translations podcast — which launched Thursday — with people who have worked for Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

“I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us,” said Michael Pillsbury, an influential adviser to the Trump administration on China and author of the book, “The Hundred Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.”

“I finally woke up,” he said. “But I would not say everybody's awakened even at this point.”

The Trump doctrine marks a repudiation of decades of U.S. trade orthodoxy — that reached its high point in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, and capitalism and liberalism appeared on the march. This “End of History” euphoria culminated in Clinton pushing past his party’s populist instincts on trade and embracing the elite view that the world was becoming more integrated, more rules-based, and more prosperous, and that this meant good things both for American and the rest of humanity.

In 1993, he signed into law NAFTA, which had been negotiated by the Bush administration, and enabled China’s accession into the WTO, stating in a 2000 speech: “By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.”

That democratic dream now appears dead — and with it American patience to wait for China to reform itself.

The China hawks in the White House believe now is the best — and perhaps last — moment for the U.S. to take dramatic economic action against China, even at the cost of roiling markets and upending a strong U.S. economy.

And they have tethered the rest of U.S. trade policy — demands of Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan — to an aggressive agenda of increasingly squeezing China out of global supply chains while pressing for structural change in Beijing. When U.S. business leaders have warned, cajoled, and pleaded about the economic risks of a trade war, they have been rebuffed with the argument that it is precisely the strong economy that has wedged open a historic window of opportunity to make the move.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has described China as an “existential problem,” wants to use U.S. economic leverage to demand serious structural changes in China — while the U.S. still has that leverage.

The urgency behind the strategy concerns technology: China’s attempts to supercharge the growth of nascent tech industries by subsidizing them and forcing the handover of U.S. intellectual property. The goal is to leapfrog from its past status as a developing nation exporting cheap plastic wares to a leader in strategic emerging technologies that will define the next technological age — such as 5G and the next-generation internet, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

China has copied U.S. technology, sometimes by requiring joint ventures and the sharing of intellectual property and other times by outright theft. The end of these forced technological transfers is Lighthizer’s central aim — even if they mean that soybean farmers will pay the price. If America fails to do so and becomes “number two in technology,” he told a congressional hearing in February, “then the world is going to look very different for our children.”

Pillsbury, the Trump adviser, said the administration fears not only losing a commercial rivalry — but enabling an Orwellian future in which an authoritarian Beijing controls global surveillance, directs online speech and embeds government control into the very plumbing of the internet.

“Their idea is the whole world will have this combination of [surveillance] cameras, your shopping patterns, what magazines you subscribe to, who your friends are, where you go based on your cell phone being geolocated,” with the aim of creating a social credit score, he said. “To what degree do you support the Communist Party of China? Have you ever criticized anything? And then when you apply to get a loan or to go to college or to do anything, your social credit score will tell how the government’s going to treat you.”

“Everybody in the world will be under this kind of system,” Pillsbury said of the authoritarian vision of the future.

Increasingly, the U.S. military is concerned, too. The 2018 national security strategy, signed by former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, asserts that China seeks “regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.”

This big picture explains in part why the Trump administration has been willing to wrest open trade relations with allies in order to remake the terms of global trade — it’s not just about a better bilateral deal for the U.S., but about a particular approach to China. Take the steel tariffs against Canada and Mexico that were aimed at “closing the back door” to subsidized steel from China, among other places; and the insertion of language in the new North American agreement that would expel a country from the agreement if it entered into a free trade agreement with a “non-market economy,” or new requirements aimed at reducing the share of Chinese parts in North America car production. Likewise, the administration will have China in mind as it opens talks with Japan and Europe.

In Trumpland, the long-term goals apparently outweigh the short-term chaos and pain.

Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, recalled a meeting with senior Trump administration officials and groups representing industries affected by tariffs, who argued that the economic effects of Trump’s economic policies would be undone by a trade war. “It was really one of the most brilliant presentations I’ve ever seen — PowerPoint graphics, the whole thing — that said, ‘If you do this, administration, if you do what you're talking about doing on trade,” he recalled, “you’re going to take back all the economic gains you’ve made from tax reform.”

“And everybody thought it was a mic drop moment, right? Aha! And everybody in the administration kind of looked at each other and said, ‘We know. You think we don't know that?’”

Over two decades, 9/11, the wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis and recovery, made action too difficult, according to Ujczo — and the possibility of a next recession could close the window. “If we don’t do this now, when will we ever do this? It’s really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right.”

While Democrats don’t agree with all of Trump’s tactics, long-standing concerns about China have been bipartisan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was an early opponent of China’s entry into the WTO. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has long decried Chinese currency manipulation. Schumer recently tweeted, “Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”

The Obama administration shared concerns about Chinese subsidies and technological theft but attempted to address them by negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a new agreement with 11 other nations. The idea was to encircle China by creating a free-trade zone with its neighbors and set high standards that China would eventually have to accept in order to join. In trying to sell the deal to a skeptical public in 2015, Obama said China had been “putting out feelers” about eventually joining the pact.

But the agreement lacked public and Congressional support amid a backlash against globalization. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement after he was elected and has opted instead for an increasingly bilateral approach to confronting China — using threats, tariffs and negotiations with other nations as a way to influence China. In many ways, it was the administration’s firmest rebuke of the international coalition-building approach of Republican and Democratic administrations that preceded it.

While critics of the TPP said it wasn’t enough to force structural changes in China, supporters say Trump gave up a powerful tool.

“I think [it] is perhaps the most significant strategic blunder in recent American history,” said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative under Obama. “We’ve lost that position for the United States at least for now, and we have created a void, a vacuum that China is quite effectively filling at the moment.”

Trump’s agenda doesn’t necessarily mean an end to trade. But it does mean surrendering faith in gauzy principles and far-reaching trade protocols. Instead, go toe-to-toe with trade competitors at times and in sectors of one’s own choosing — and know that adversaries won’t respect you unless you prove on occasion that you are willing to inflict pain on others (and accept it yourself) to win a conflict.

And it leaves open the possibility that the confrontation with China could embolden hawks on both sides.

In trying to sell the deal to a skeptical public in 2015, Obama said China had been “putting out feelers” about eventually joining the pact.

But the agreement lacked public and Congressional support amid a backlash against globalization. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement after he was elected and has opted instead for an increasingly bilateral approach to confronting China — using threats, tariffs and negotiations with other nations as a way to influence China. In many ways, it was the administration’s firmest rebuke of the international coalition-building approach of Republican and Democratic administrations that preceded it.

While critics of the TPP said it wasn’t enough to force structural changes in China, supporters say Trump gave up a powerful tool.

“I think [it] is perhaps the most significant strategic blunder in recent American history,” said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative under Obama. “We’ve lost that position for the United States at least for now, and we have created a void, a vacuum that China is quite effectively filling at the moment.”

Trump’s agenda doesn’t necessarily mean an end to trade. But it does mean surrendering faith in gauzy principles and far-reaching trade protocols. Instead, go toe-to-toe with trade competitors at times and in sectors of one’s own choosing — and know that adversaries won’t respect you unless you prove on occasion that you are willing to inflict pain on others (and accept it yourself) to win a conflict.

And it leaves open the possibility that the confrontation with China could embolden hawks on both sides.

Donald Trump is not winging it.

Or at least he’s not totally winging it.

Story Continued Below

However improvisational his daily machinations on trade — presenting publicly as motivated by a random mix of mood and twitches of the news cycle, including the latest threat of tariffs against Mexico — Trump and his team are acting on a well-developed theory of the case, one that has been decades in the making.

In Trump’s case, that strategy is intuitive. He’s been saying since the 1980s — and by all evidence genuinely believes — that the United States is letting itself be played for the fool by foreign adversaries, on trade specifically and global competition generally. Strong nations robustly protect domestic industries and keep foreign competitors at heel. Back in the ’80s his focus was more typically Japan; in recent years, but long before 2016, he’s been focused on China.

In the case of his advisers, the theory of the case is more intellectual. They believe that the big bet free trade advocates made in the 1990s — that welcoming China into the WTO would encourage it to integrate into a rules-based global economy — has proved to be a loser. China, by these lights, is happy to take advantage of the U.S. and other players’ commitment to free trade and rules but will continue to steal and subsidize to advance its own interests.

This method to the apparent madness has emerged in interviews for the new Global Translations podcast — which launched Thursday — with people who have worked for Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

“I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us,” said Michael Pillsbury, an influential adviser to the Trump administration on China and author of the book, “The Hundred Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.”

“I finally woke up,” he said. “But I would not say everybody's awakened even at this point.”

The Trump doctrine marks a repudiation of decades of U.S. trade orthodoxy — that reached its high point in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, and capitalism and liberalism appeared on the march. This “End of History” euphoria culminated in Clinton pushing past his party’s populist instincts on trade and embracing the elite view that the world was becoming more integrated, more rules-based, and more prosperous, and that this meant good things both for American and the rest of humanity.

In 1993, he signed into law NAFTA, which had been negotiated by the Bush administration, and enabled China’s accession into the WTO, stating in a 2000 speech: “By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.”

That democratic dream now appears dead — and with it American patience to wait for China to reform itself.

The China hawks in the White House believe now is the best — and perhaps last — moment for the U.S. to take dramatic economic action against China, even at the cost of roiling markets and upending a strong U.S. economy.

And they have tethered the rest of U.S. trade policy — demands of Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan — to an aggressive agenda of increasingly squeezing China out of global supply chains while pressing for structural change in Beijing. When U.S. business leaders have warned, cajoled, and pleaded about the economic risks of a trade war, they have been rebuffed with the argument that it is precisely the strong economy that has wedged open a historic window of opportunity to make the move.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has described China as an “existential problem,” wants to use U.S. economic leverage to demand serious structural changes in China — while the U.S. still has that leverage.

The urgency behind the strategy concerns technology: China’s attempts to supercharge the growth of nascent tech industries by subsidizing them and forcing the handover of U.S. intellectual property. The goal is to leapfrog from its past status as a developing nation exporting cheap plastic wares to a leader in strategic emerging technologies that will define the next technological age — such as 5G and the next-generation internet, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

China has copied U.S. technology, sometimes by requiring joint ventures and the sharing of intellectual property and other times by outright theft. The end of these forced technological transfers is Lighthizer’s central aim — even if they mean that soybean farmers will pay the price. If America fails to do so and becomes “number two in technology,” he told a congressional hearing in February, “then the world is going to look very different for our children.”

Pillsbury, the Trump adviser, said the administration fears not only losing a commercial rivalry — but enabling an Orwellian future in which an authoritarian Beijing controls global surveillance, directs online speech and embeds government control into the very plumbing of the internet.

“Their idea is the whole world will have this combination of [surveillance] cameras, your shopping patterns, what magazines you subscribe to, who your friends are, where you go based on your cell phone being geolocated,” with the aim of creating a social credit score, he said. “To what degree do you support the Communist Party of China? Have you ever criticized anything? And then when you apply to get a loan or to go to college or to do anything, your social credit score will tell how the government’s going to treat you.”

“Everybody in the world will be under this kind of system,” Pillsbury said of the authoritarian vision of the future.

Increasingly, the U.S. military is concerned, too. The 2018 national security strategy, signed by former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, asserts that China seeks “regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.”

This big picture explains in part why the Trump administration has been willing to wrest open trade relations with allies in order to remake the terms of global trade — it’s not just about a better bilateral deal for the U.S., but about a particular approach to China. Take the steel tariffs against Canada and Mexico that were aimed at “closing the back door” to subsidized steel from China, among other places; and the insertion of language in the new North American agreement that would expel a country from the agreement if it entered into a free trade agreement with a “non-market economy,” or new requirements aimed at reducing the share of Chinese parts in North America car production. Likewise, the administration will have China in mind as it opens talks with Japan and Europe.

In Trumpland, the long-term goals apparently outweigh the short-term chaos and pain.

Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, recalled a meeting with senior Trump administration officials and groups representing industries affected by tariffs, who argued that the economic effects of Trump’s economic policies would be undone by a trade war. “It was really one of the most brilliant presentations I’ve ever seen — PowerPoint graphics, the whole thing — that said, ‘If you do this, administration, if you do what you're talking about doing on trade,” he recalled, “you’re going to take back all the economic gains you’ve made from tax reform.”

“And everybody thought it was a mic drop moment, right? Aha! And everybody in the administration kind of looked at each other and said, ‘We know. You think we don't know that?’”

Over two decades, 9/11, the wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis and recovery, made action too difficult, according to Ujczo — and the possibility of a next recession could close the window. “If we don’t do this now, when will we ever do this? It’s really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right.”

While Democrats don’t agree with all of Trump’s tactics, long-standing concerns about China have been bipartisan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was an early opponent of China’s entry into the WTO. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has long decried Chinese currency manipulation. Schumer recently tweeted, “Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”

The Obama administration shared concerns about Chinese subsidies and technological theft but attempted to address them by negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a new agreement with 11 other nations. The idea was to encircle China by creating a free-trade zone with its neighbors and set high standards that China would eventually have to accept in order to join.

223,Trump resort revenue has gone up after presidential visits,Anita Kumar,"President Donald Trump meets members of Bikers for Trump and other supporters outside the clubhouse of Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., on Aug. 11, 2018. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo white house Trump resort revenue has gone up after presidential visits Trump is staying at his luxury resort on Ireland’s west coast this week.

Donald Trump is on a global tour of his own businesses — and it’s putting more money in his bank account.

On Wednesday, the president traveled to his luxury resort on Ireland’s west coast for a visit that will bring world-wide publicity and increased security to the location, and, if past trends hold, more revenue.

Story Continued Below

Revenue increased in 2018 at many of the Trump developments that he visited that year, according to Trump’s most recent personal financial disclosure forms.

There’s Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., where he dines on steak dinners; Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where he spends his weekends; and Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey, where he vacations over the summer. And revenue increased by $3.1 million at Trump Turnberry, the resort on the Scottish coast he visited in July 2018, according to the documents.

It’s difficult to know the exact reason for the boost — and increased revenue doesn’t always equal an overall profit — but some see a link between Trump’s presence and revenue.

“I’m sure publicity can’t hurt,” said Laurence Hirsh, president of Golf Property Analysts and a former president of the Society of Golf Appraisers. “There’s people that don’t like him that would go for the novelty of it.”

The trend is especially notable as Trump’s overall income dipped slightly from $450 million in 2017 to $434 million in 2018. At least $47 million of that money came from from 16 properties around the globe, according to the disclosure forms. While not all of the foreign properties reported revenue boosts, six of them — two in Scotland and one each in Ireland, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the Dominican Republic — collectively brought in more than $6.9 million in additional revenue. The figure includes $3.2 million from the sale of land in the Dominican Republic.

On Wednesday and Thursday, Trump and first lady Melania Trump will stay at Trump International Golf Links in Doonbeg, Ireland — the final leg of a week-long trip to Europe.

Trump considered canceling his trip to Ireland when the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, scoffed at meeting at his golf course, the Irish Times reported in May. The president would have likely traveled to Scotland, where he has two golf courses. Instead, the men two agreed to meet at the Shannon airport.

Trump’s trip to his Irish golf course has once again led to criticisms that Trump is using the presidency to make money for his own business. It marks the second time he has visited one of his properties outside the United States since he was sworn into office.

“U.S. foreign relations should never rise and fall on the financial interests of the president and the ability to promote his own property,” said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which examined his financial disclosures.

The White House and Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. After landing in Ireland, Trump told reporters that he was not there to promote his resort.

“I'm staying here overnight, and I thought this would be the best place. I'd love to come to Ireland and stay at Doonbeg,” he said. “This trip is really about great relationships that we have with the U.K. And I really wanted to do this stop in Ireland. It was very important to me because of the relationship I have with the people and with your prime minister.”

Trump has long faced ethics criticisms over his decision to not fully separate from his family business, the Trump Organization, after being elected. The president still owns his business but placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit. He can receive money from the trust at any time.

Several House Democratic committees have demanded Trump release his tax returns to gain more information about his finances, but he and his staff have refused. The Trump Organization, a private company that has more than 500 businesses, does not have to publicly release financial information in the United States.

As president, Trump has visited one of his properties on roughly 250 days, according to a compilation of information released by the White House. He even stopped in Hawaii on his way to Asia in 2017, staying for a few minutes to thank employees for their hard work.

Many of those properties have seen an uptick in revenue. The Trump National Doral golf resort in Florida increased its revenue by around $1.2 million in 2018. Revenue at the Trump International Hotel in Washington — which has become a top destination for Republicans — increased by $400,000. And the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., and the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia saw its revenue go up more than $500,000 each.

The one major exception is Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s now well-known resort in South Florida. Despite doubling its initiation fee to $200,000, the resort’s revenue dropped slightly in 2018, to $22.7 million.

Trump’s properties have been a welcoming oasis for a president who often faces protesters when he travels.

In England this week, tens of thousands of people turned out to oppose Trump’s presence. But in Doonbeg, Trump is being welcomed warmly — not so much as president of the United States but as the largest employer in the village of 754 people.

“As a small country with close ties to the U.S., most Irish people are pragmatic about keeping cordial relations,” said Hugh Linehan, arts and culture editor at the Irish Times. “You can see a turbocharged version of that pragmatism around Doonbeg, where there’s obviously a more direct financial benefit to be gained.”

Trump bought Doonbeg for $11 million in 2014 and proceeded to spend more than $30 million for renovations, according to news reports. In 2018, financial forms show Trump earned $14.5 million at Doonbeg in what he describes as “golf-related revenue,” up about 2 percent from the previous year.

But the rising revenue doesn’t necessarily mean the resort is a big money maker for Trump.

According to documents filed with the Irish government, the resort has still lost millions overall. The discrepancy, some experts say, stems from Trump incorrectly listing his company’s revenue instead of his personal income on his financial disclosure statement. Federal law requires top administration officials to list their personal assets and income.

In honor of Trump’s visit Wednesday, U.S. flags have been erected around the village, which is offering free pony and paddle boat rides, traditional Irish music and dancing on Main Street.

“There have been calls from local politicians to give him a warm welcome because he has done so much for the region,” said Sarah Daniel, an American transplant who lives in Clare, the county where the golf course is located.

224,Trump’s trade war gobsmacks Mexico and Canada,Sabrina Rodriguez,"“What we are doing is, prepare and keep a strategy of how to coexist with what is sometimes unpredictable. That’s our obligation,” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Trade Trump’s trade war gobsmacks Mexico and Canada Mexican and Canadian officials spent two years learning how to navigate a fractious U.S. president. Now they’re deploying those lessons to find a way out of Trump’s latest trade flare-up.

It was a jubilant day for North America. At least, it looked that way to leaders in Mexico City and Ottawa.

Steel tariffs had just been lifted across the continent. Relieved Canadians had responded by introducing a bill to implement USMCA, the Trump administration’s signature trade deal, and Mexico had just followed suit on Thursday. Vice President Mike Pence was in Ottawa to celebrate the progress and cheer on America’s neighbors.

Story Continued Below

Within hours, the moment of continental comity blew up with two tweets from President Donald Trump.

Trump’s sudden declaration of new tariffs on Mexico last Thursday evening delivered immediate whiplash, a jolt for two countries that had — for a moment — thought they might be coming off the Trump roller coaster.

“It’s never over,” said one Canadian official, describing the constant drama of life dealing with Trump.

Officials in Mexico and Canada in recent days kicked into gear with playbooks they’ve each used repeatedly in navigating a fractious relationship with Trump over the past two years. They’re deploying lessons other nations have come to learn as well: stay calm, speak the American president’s language and find Trump-friendly voices who can lean on him to deescalate the tensions.

Both countries also have learned to lean on each other with an informal support network to plot strategy and shape a shared action plan to keep Trump’s America First approach from destroying America’s two allies next door.

“What we are doing is, prepare and keep a strategy of how to coexist with what is sometimes unpredictable. That’s our obligation,” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Tuesday.

“It’s impossible for Mexico to control” what unpredictable actions the Trump administration may take in the future, he added, but “we are going to be ready.”

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday in London, Trump said it’s “likely” the 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports will go into effect June 10, even though U.S. and Mexican officials have not yet had a formal meeting to work on a solution.

Trump officials, including Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will meet with Mexican officials on Wednesday at the White House to discuss the situation, including Trump’s demand to prevent migrants from entering the United States from Mexico.

America’s neighbors have tried to project calm, insisting publicly that USMCA remains unaffected by the latest tariff twist.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3822/1155968404_6044430054001_6044423370001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Officials have mostly maintained the confident line that the agreement will still be ratified. The more candid ones acknowledge, however, that tensions created by the fresh tariffs could stall ratification.

“In Mexico, we’re going to continue” with USMCA, Mexico’s Undersecretary for North America Jesús Seade said Tuesday. “In the United States, I don’t know what they can do” with the tariffs threat right now. The new pact “is a little in waiting,” he added.

Current and former Mexican officials said the tariffs might create a new roadblock to an already precarious situation with House Democrats, who have specified they want changes to the deal before they approve it.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats were already upset with Trump earlier last Thursday over his administration’s decision to send a draft statement to Congress that paves the way for moving forward on a vote for the USMCA. Democrats largely viewed the move as an effort to increase pressure for them to pass the deal quickly.

Pelosi and top House Democrats met with Ebrard on Tuesday afternoon for a “constructive and candid discussion” about the replacement deal for NAFTA and Trump’s tariffs threat, a spokesperson for Pelosi said.

Mexican officials held meetings across Washington this week with key Trump administration officials, such as acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

They’ve also turned to Twitter to broadcast how they’re trying to talk Trump down from the tariffs — a move one former Mexican official called “trying to speak in Trump’s language.”

Mexico is prepared with a plan A and plan B, just in case. One is a proposal for how to tackle illegal migration at the border, and the other is a plan that’s expected to include targeted retaliation on American goods.

Mexico has not offered details on either proposal. But it has specified that while it wants to work out a deal with the U.S., it will not sacrifice Mexico’s dignity.

Trump’s sudden move has already helped to unite Mexico’s business leaders and lawmakers in support of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Top Mexican lawmakers and business leaders are also in Washington this week for meetings with their U.S. counterparts to ensure that the Mexican government’s message is clear: Tariffs are bad for both economies and for the long-standing alliance between the two nations.

“We’re trying to remind Trump and his administration that we’re their ally — not an ‘abuser,’” a Mexican official said, nodding to Trump’s tweet on Sunday that Mexico has been an “abuser” of the United States, “taking but never giving.”

The Canadians prepared long ago for life with Trump, shuffling their cabinet to deal with the new president in 2017 . They even staffed a rapid-response unit within the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that operates like a campaign war room , dedicated to crises caused by the U.S. president.

The challenges with Trump have forced Mexico and Canada to lean on each other regularly, strategizing around how to handle a U.S. leader well accustomed to attacking long-time allies.

In public, Canadian officials insist the latest standoff is a bilateral issue between the U.S. and Mexico. Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland reiterated Monday the Canadian view that it doesn’t affect USMCA implementation.

But they’re still talking quietly behind the scenes. Freeland and Mexican Economy Secretary Graciela Márquez had a Friday evening phone chat to discuss how to navigate the latest crisis out of Washington.

Their informal mutual support network has generally been reliable, despite a few hiccups along the way.

Both countries worked together through the renegotiation of NAFTA over the past two years. Their common front only broke late in the negotiation, leading to one heated argument between Canadian and Mexican officials last year about which country had betrayed the other by cutting side deals with the U.S.

But this year they stood in lockstep over steel tariffs, with a new government leading Mexico.

Mexico could have had a tariff lift sooner, but refused to go along without Canada.

In recent weeks, López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s governments worked together with top U.S. lawmakers to get the message out that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs needed to be lifted after months of deadlock.

López Obrador had instructed Seade to negotiate with Lighthizer to pull back the tariffs as quickly as possible to clear the path for USMCA passage. The Mexican leader has repeatedly expressed a desire to put the trade pact behind him so he can focus on domestic issues and bring certainty to investors in Mexico.

With that mandate, Seade met with Lighthizer over three weeks for intense discussions to end U.S. tariffs.

That’s when Seade and Lighthizer phoned Freeland to set up individual meetings with her to discuss the potential deal.

“Her conflict was really with the United States. It was a bilateral issue. But, you know, we’re in a deal together,” Seade said when the deal was announced.

Seade and Márquez headed to Canada three days later to present the deal with the United States.

During that trip, the Mexican and Canadian officials then discussed how lifting the tariffs would create momentum for passage of USMCA in their respective legislatures.

Freeland had already been in close contact with Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) about the need for the Trump administration to lift the duties to clear a path for ratification in all three countries. She also promised help for Mexico in implementing its landmark labor reform, which U.S. Democrats and their union allies are watching closely.

Freeland met the following day with Lighthizer in Washington and the steel tariffs were quickly lifted on both countries.

That brought two weeks of relative peace in the North American neighborhood.

The mood remained all positive before the head-spinning plot twist with the latest tariffs on Mexico that threatened to blow everything up once again.

Last Thursday, Pence had just left a celebratory feeling in Ottawa when both countries heard about new tariffs. Two Canadian officials said it never came up in Pence’s meeting with Trudeau.

“It surprised everyone,” one senior Canadian official said.

Steel tariffs had just been lifted across the continent.

Vice President Mike Pence was in Ottawa to celebrate the progress and cheer on America’s neighbors.

Within hours, the moment of continental comity blew up with two tweets from President Donald Trump.

Trump’s sudden declaration of new tariffs on Mexico last Thursday evening delivered immediate whiplash, a jolt for two countries that had — for a moment — thought they might be coming off the Trump roller coaster.

“It’s never over,” said one Canadian official, describing the constant drama of life dealing with Trump.

Officials in Mexico and Canada in recent days kicked into gear with playbooks they’ve each used repeatedly in navigating a fractious relationship with Trump over the past two years. They’re deploying lessons other nations have come to learn as well: stay calm, speak the American president’s language and find Trump-friendly voices who can lean on him to deescalate the tensions.

Both countries also have learned to lean on each other with an informal support network to plot strategy and shape a shared action plan to keep Trump’s America First approach from destroying America’s two allies next door.

“What we are doing is, prepare and keep a strategy of how to coexist with what is sometimes unpredictable. That’s our obligation,” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Tuesday.

“It’s impossible for Mexico to control” what unpredictable actions the Trump administration may take in the future, he added, but “we are going to be ready.”

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday in London, Trump said it’s “likely” the 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports will go into effect June 10, even though U.S. and Mexican officials have not yet had a formal meeting to work on a solution.

Trump officials, including Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will meet with Mexican officials on Wednesday at the White House to discuss the situation, including Trump’s demand to prevent migrants from entering the United States from Mexico.

America’s neighbors have tried to project calm, insisting publicly that USMCA remains unaffected by the latest tariff twist.

Officials have mostly maintained the confident line that the agreement will still be ratified. The more candid ones acknowledge, however, that tensions created by the fresh tariffs could stall ratification.

“In Mexico, we’re going to continue” with USMCA, Mexico’s Undersecretary for North America Jesús Seade said Tuesday. “In the United States, I don’t know what they can do” with the tariffs threat right now. The new pact “is a little in waiting,” he added.

Current and former Mexican officials said the tariffs might create a new roadblock to an already precarious situation with House Democrats, who have specified they want changes to the deal before they approve it.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats were already upset with Trump earlier last Thursday over his administration’s decision to send a draft statement to Congress that paves the way for moving forward on a vote for the USMCA. Democrats largely viewed the move as an effort to increase pressure for them to pass the deal quickly.

Pelosi and top House Democrats met with Ebrard on Tuesday afternoon for a “constructive and candid discussion” about the replacement deal for NAFTA and Trump’s tariffs threat, a spokesperson for Pelosi said.

Mexican officials held meetings across Washington this week with key Trump administration officials, such as acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

They’ve also turned to Twitter to broadcast how they’re trying to talk Trump down from the tariffs — a move one former Mexican official called “trying to speak in Trump’s language.”

Mexico is prepared with a plan A and plan B, just in case. One is a proposal for how to tackle illegal migration at the border, and the other is a plan that’s expected to include targeted retaliation on American goods.

Mexico has not offered details on either proposal. But it has specified that while it wants to work out a deal with the U.S., it will not sacrifice Mexico’s dignity.

Trump’s sudden move has already helped to unite Mexico’s business leaders and lawmakers in support of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Top Mexican lawmakers and business leaders are also in Washington this week for meetings with their U.S. counterparts to ensure that the Mexican government’s message is clear: Tariffs are bad for both economies and for the long-standing alliance between the two nations.

“We’re trying to remind Trump and his administration that we’re their ally — not an ‘abuser,’” a Mexican official said, nodding to Trump’s tweet on Sunday that Mexico has been an “abuser” of the United States, “taking but never giving.”

The Canadians prepared long ago for life with Trump, shuffling their cabinet to deal with the new president in 2017 . They even staffed a rapid-response unit within the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that operates like a campaign war room , dedicated to crises caused by the U.S. president.

The challenges with Trump have forced Mexico and Canada to lean on each other regularly, strategizing around how to handle a U.S. leader well accustomed to attacking long-time allies.

In public, Canadian officials insist the latest standoff is a bilateral issue between the U.S. and Mexico. Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland reiterated Monday the Canadian view that it doesn’t affect USMCA implementation.

But they’re still talking quietly behind the scenes. Freeland and Mexican Economy Secretary Graciela Márquez had a Friday evening phone chat to discuss how to navigate the latest crisis out of Washington.

Their informal mutual support network has generally been reliable, despite a few hiccups along the way.

Both countries worked together through the renegotiation of NAFTA over the past two years. Their common front only broke late in the negotiation, leading to one heated argument between Canadian and Mexican officials last year about which country had betrayed the other by cutting side deals with the U.S.

But this year they stood in lockstep over steel tariffs, with a new government leading Mexico.

Mexico could have had a tariff lift sooner, but refused to go along without Canada.

In recent weeks, López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s governments worked together with top U.S. lawmakers to get the message out that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs needed to be lifted after months of deadlock.

López Obrador had instructed Seade to negotiate with Lighthizer to pull back the tariffs as quickly as possible to clear the path for USMCA passage. The Mexican leader has repeatedly expressed a desire to put the trade pact behind him so he can focus on domestic issues and bring certainty to investors in Mexico.

With that mandate, Seade met with Lighthizer over three weeks for intense discussions to end U.S. tariffs.

That’s when Seade and Lighthizer phoned Freeland to set up individual meetings with her to discuss the potential deal.

“Her conflict was really with the United States. It was a bilateral issue. But, you know, we’re in a deal together,” Seade said when the deal was announced.

Seade and Márquez headed to Canada three days later to present the deal with the United States.

During that trip, the Mexican and Canadian officials then discussed how lifting the tariffs would create momentum for passage of USMCA in their respective legislatures.

Freeland had already been in close contact with Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) about the need for the Trump administration to lift the duties to clear a path for ratification in all three countries. She also promised help for Mexico in implementing its landmark labor reform, which U.S. Democrats and their union allies are watching closely.

Freeland met the following day with Lighthizer in Washington and the steel tariffs were quickly lifted on both countries.

That brought two weeks of relative peace in the North American neighborhood.

The mood remained all positive before the head-spinning plot twist with the latest tariffs on Mexico that threatened to blow everything up once again.

Last Thursday, Pence had just left a celebratory feeling in Ottawa when both countries heard about new tariffs. Two Canadian officials said it never came up in Pence’s meeting with Trudeau.

“It surprised everyone,” one senior Canadian official said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats were already upset with Trump earlier last Thursday over his administration’s decision to send a draft statement to Congress that paves the way for moving forward on a vote for the USMCA. Democrats largely viewed the move as an effort to increase pressure for them to pass the deal quickly.

Pelosi and top House Democrats met with Ebrard on Tuesday afternoon for a “constructive and candid discussion” about the replacement deal for NAFTA and Trump’s tariffs threat, a spokesperson for Pelosi said.

Mexican officials held meetings across Washington this week with key Trump administration officials, such as acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

They’ve also turned to Twitter to broadcast how they’re trying to talk Trump down from the tariffs — a move one former Mexican official called “trying to speak in Trump’s language.”

Mexico is prepared with a plan A and plan B, just in case. One is a proposal for how to tackle illegal migration at the border, and the other is a plan that’s expected to include targeted retaliation on American goods.

Mexico has not offered details on either proposal. But it has specified that while it wants to work out a deal with the U.S., it will not sacrifice Mexico’s dignity.

Trump’s sudden move has already helped to unite Mexico’s business leaders and lawmakers in support of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Top Mexican lawmakers and business leaders are also in Washington this week for meetings with their U.S. counterparts to ensure that the Mexican government’s message is clear: Tariffs are bad for both economies and for the long-standing alliance between the two nations.

“We’re trying to remind Trump and his administration that we’re their ally — not an ‘abuser,’” a Mexican official said, nodding to Trump’s tweet on Sunday that Mexico has been an “abuser” of the United States, “taking but never giving.”

The Canadians prepared long ago for life with Trump, shuffling their cabinet to deal with the new president in 2017 . They even staffed a rapid-response unit within the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that operates like a campaign war room , dedicated to crises caused by the U.S. president.

The challenges with Trump have forced Mexico and Canada to lean on each other regularly, strategizing around how to handle a U.S. leader well accustomed to attacking long-time allies.

In public, Canadian officials insist the latest standoff is a bilateral issue between the U.S. and Mexico. Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland reiterated Monday the Canadian view that it doesn’t affect USMCA implementation.

But they’re still talking quietly behind the scenes. Freeland and Mexican Economy Secretary Graciela Márquez had a Friday evening phone chat to discuss how to navigate the latest crisis out of Washington.

Their informal mutual support network has generally been reliable, despite a few hiccups along the way.

Both countries worked together through the renegotiation of NAFTA over the past two years. Their common front only broke late in the negotiation, leading to one heated argument between Canadian and Mexican officials last year about which country had betrayed the other by cutting side deals with the U.S.

But this year they stood in lockstep over steel tariffs, with a new government leading Mexico.

Mexico could have had a tariff lift sooner, but refused to go along without Canada.

In recent weeks, López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s governments worked together with top U.S. lawmakers to get the message out that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs needed to be lifted after months of deadlock.

López Obrador had instructed Seade to negotiate with Lighthizer to pull back the tariffs as quickly as possible to clear the path for USMCA passage. The Mexican leader has repeatedly expressed a desire to put the trade pact behind him so he can focus on domestic issues and bring certainty to investors in Mexico.

With that mandate, Seade met with Lighthizer over three weeks for intense discussions to end U.S. tariffs.

That’s when Seade and Lighthizer phoned Freeland to set up individual meetings with her to discuss the potential deal.

“Her conflict was really with the United States. It was a bilateral issue. But, you know, we’re in a deal together,” Seade said when the deal was announced.

Seade and Márquez headed to Canada three days later to present the deal with the United States.

During that trip, the Mexican and Canadian officials then discussed how lifting the tariffs would create momentum for passage of USMCA in their respective legislatures.

Freeland had already been in close contact with Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) about the need for the Trump administration to lift the duties to clear a path for ratification in all three countries. She also promised help for Mexico in implementing its landmark labor reform, which U.S. Democrats and their union allies are watching closely.

Freeland met the following day with Lighthizer in Washington and the steel tariffs were quickly lifted on both countries.

That brought two weeks of relative peace in the North American neighborhood.

The mood remained all positive before the head-spinning plot twist with the latest tariffs on Mexico that threatened to blow everything up once again.

Last Thursday, Pence had just left a celebratory feeling in Ottawa when both countries heard about new tariffs. Two Canadian officials said it never came up in Pence’s meeting with Trudeau.

“It surprised everyone,” one senior Canadian official said.

Within hours, the moment of continental comity blew up with two tweets from President Donald Trump.

Trump’s sudden declaration of new tariffs on Mexico last Thursday evening delivered immediate whiplash, a jolt for two countries that had — for a moment — thought they might be coming off the Trump roller coaster.

“It’s never over,” said one Canadian official, describing the constant drama of life dealing with Trump.

Officials in Mexico and Canada in recent days kicked into gear with playbooks they’ve each used repeatedly in navigating a fractious relationship with Trump over the past two years. They’re deploying lessons other nations have come to learn as well: stay calm, speak the American president’s language and find Trump-friendly voices who can lean on him to deescalate the tensions.

Both countries also have learned to lean on each other with an informal support network to plot strategy and shape a shared action plan to keep Trump’s America First approach from destroying America’s two allies next door.

“What we are doing is, prepare and keep a strategy of how to coexist with what is sometimes unpredictable. That’s our obligation,” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Tuesday.

“It’s impossible for Mexico to control” what unpredictable actions the Trump administration may take in the future, he added, but “we are going to be ready.”

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday in London, Trump said it’s “likely” the 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports will go into effect June 10, even though U.S. and Mexican officials have not yet had a formal meeting to work on a solution.

Trump officials, including Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will meet with Mexican officials on Wednesday at the White House to discuss the situation, including Trump’s demand to prevent migrants from entering the United States from Mexico.

America’s neighbors have tried to project calm, insisting publicly that USMCA remains unaffected by the latest tariff twist.

Officials have mostly maintained the confident line that the agreement will still be ratified. The more candid ones acknowledge, however, that tensions created by the fresh tariffs could stall ratification.

While President Donald Trump dined with the British royal family, his team back in Washington was rushing to deal with the expanding trade war he left behind.

Administration officials started the week with a multi-front scramble as they sought to ease worries about another market-shaking tariff escalation, explain the president’s thinking to allies and salvage negotiations with lawmakers over his signature trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.

Story Continued Below

Trump says he’ll hit Mexico with escalating tariffs starting next Monday unless the country does more to stem the flow of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The threat is already infuriating lawmakers, who warn that such a move could damage a strong U.S. economy and undermine efforts to win congressional approval of the USMCA, one of Trump’s top legislative priorities.

“I don’t even want to think about it,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) of the potential economic fallout that could hit his state if Trump slaps tariffs on Mexico. He warned of dire consequences for Trump’s legislative agenda, too. “I think this calls into question our ability to pass the USMCA.”

Congressional aides from both parties have even begun quietly discussing the possibility of voting to overturn the new tariffs if Trump imposes them, a move that would set up another dramatic showdown with the White House.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who spoke with Trump by phone on Friday, said she emphasized to the president that Republicans should focus on approving the new North American trade deal and then shift separately to the situation on the border. But Trump was undeterred, she said. “He’s a tariff guy.”

“I’m not pleased,” Ernst said, predicting the party would concentrate on trying to sway Trump in the coming week. “Hopefully he’ll be receptive. But right now he’s not that receptive.”

Few Republicans offered much support for the move on Monday evening, according to interviews with a half-dozen GOP senators.

“I’m concerned both with China and Mexico,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a close Trump ally. “Worldwide tariffs are what led to the exacerbation of the Great Depression. ... Tariffs are a bad idea. Interruption of trade is a bad idea.”

The White House plans to send an official to Senate Republicans’ policy lunch on Tuesday to answer questions about the pending Mexico tariffs. Trump’s aides, including members of the White House legislative affairs team, have sought to tamp down frustrations in Congress by separating the issues and encouraging lawmakers to not let their opposition to the tariffs stand in the way of approving the USMCA.

White House officials, who weren’t authorized to speak on the record, said lawmakers haven’t yet told them directly that they intend to hold up the USMCA as a result of the tariff threat, and they maintained outward confidence in the deal’s prospects. “If you put this on the floor, it will pass,” one White House official said.

Some White House aides also privately held out hope that Trump wouldn’t go forward with the tariffs, given the divide inside the administration over the move.

Senate Republicans were just coming off a high point after six of them trekked to the White House this spring and finally got Trump to back off the steel and aluminum tariffs on allies, raising hopes for passage of the new trade deal. A legislative effort to restrict Trump’s national security tariff authority had stalled, but the GOP found that diplomacy could move Trump — though it took them a year to do it.

This time around Trump is moving so quickly that Republicans’ tariff legislation wouldn’t even block the new tariffs on Mexico. Rather than saber rattle over another round of legislative battles with the president, most Republicans prefer to hash things out behind closed doors.

“I don’t even want to think about it,” said Sen. John Cornyn of the potential economic fallout that could hit his state if Trump slaps tariffs on Mexico. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo

“Sometimes in his frustration [Trump] expresses the intent to do certain things, but after calm reflection and consultation with the members of the Congress has decided maybe to pursue a different course,” Cornyn said. “Legislation obviously requires a presidential signature. The better course is to have some discussions in private.”

The president’s relations Congress had already devolved into a worsening spectacle in recent weeks.

The White House is trying to ease tensions with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who railed against the administration’s decision last week to send a draft statement to Congress that paves the way for moving forward with a vote on the trade deal. Pelosi viewed the move, which the White House downplayed as a procedural step, as an effort to cut short lawmakers’ review of the trade deal and ratchet up pressure on Congress to quickly pass it.

Democrats so far have been dismissive of Trump’s latest tariff threat. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) raised her concerns about the tariffs during a closed-door leadership meeting on Monday night. In response, Pelosi suggested it was one of Trump’s diversions to distract from last week’s statement from Robert Mueller about the Russia investigation, according to two sources familiar with the exchange.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke directly to Pelosi to explain that last week’s USMCA statement wasn’t intending to force lawmakers’ hands, according to a person familiar with the matter. White House staffers have also talked to Pelosi’s staff this week about both the possible tariffs and the speaker’s frustrations with the White House’s handling of the USMCA statement, the person said.

Trump administration officials are fanning out to address the tensions in coming days.

Lighthizer is scheduled to hold calls and meetings with five lawmakers this week as part of his ongoing push to sell the USMCA. Vice President Mike Pence plans to make another pitch for passage of the trade deal during a speech in Pennsylvania on Thursday, officials said.

Trump administration officials also must navigate a sharp backlash among investors and businesses, which see the tariffs as a major threat to the economy and stock market.

“We’re taking it seriously and we’re operating as if it is going to go into effect,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly opposes the tariffs. “This wasn’t an off-handed comment, responding to a question or a social media post. The White House released a detailed proposal.”

Business groups are warning that the tariffs would raise consumer prices on everything from automobiles to avocados. An analysis by the Chamber found that a 5 percent tariff would result in a potential tax increase on U.S. businesses and consumers of $17 billion. That would jump to $86 billion if the tariffs were to reach 25 percent, which Trump said would happen on Oct. 1 if no agreement has been reached.

Trump's tariff threat is also forcing business groups to reroute advocacy efforts to get the USMCA passed by Congress. The Chamber, which has been working with the National Association of Manufacturers and more than 200 organizations to lobby for USMCA passage, is expected to focus its efforts on pushing for a reversal of the Mexico tariffs if they go into effect.

Foreign officials are joining the business groups in their opposition campaign.

While President Donald Trump dined with the British royal family, his team back in Washington was rushing to deal with the expanding trade war he left behind.

Administration officials started the week with a multi-front scramble as they sought to ease worries about another market-shaking tariff escalation, explain the president’s thinking to allies and salvage negotiations with lawmakers over his signature trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.

Story Continued Below

Trump says he’ll hit Mexico with escalating tariffs starting next Monday unless the country does more to stem the flow of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The threat is already infuriating lawmakers, who warn that such a move could damage a strong U.S. economy and undermine efforts to win congressional approval of the USMCA, one of Trump’s top legislative priorities.

“I don’t even want to think about it,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) of the potential economic fallout that could hit his state if Trump slaps tariffs on Mexico. He warned of dire consequences for Trump’s legislative agenda, too. “I think this calls into question our ability to pass the USMCA.”

Congressional aides from both parties have even begun quietly discussing the possibility of voting to overturn the new tariffs if Trump imposes them, a move that would set up another dramatic showdown with the White House.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who spoke with Trump by phone on Friday, said she emphasized to the president that Republicans should focus on approving the new North American trade deal and then shift separately to the situation on the border. But Trump was undeterred, she said. “He’s a tariff guy.”

“I’m not pleased,” Ernst said, predicting the party would concentrate on trying to sway Trump in the coming week. “Hopefully he’ll be receptive. But right now he’s not that receptive.”

Few Republicans offered much support for the move on Monday evening, according to interviews with a half-dozen GOP senators.

“I’m concerned both with China and Mexico,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a close Trump ally. “Worldwide tariffs are what led to the exacerbation of the Great Depression. ... Tariffs are a bad idea. Interruption of trade is a bad idea.”

The White House plans to send an official to Senate Republicans’ policy lunch on Tuesday to answer questions about the pending Mexico tariffs. Trump’s aides, including members of the White House legislative affairs team, have sought to tamp down frustrations in Congress by separating the issues and encouraging lawmakers to not let their opposition to the tariffs stand in the way of approving the USMCA.

White House officials, who weren’t authorized to speak on the record, said lawmakers haven’t yet told them directly that they intend to hold up the USMCA as a result of the tariff threat, and they maintained outward confidence in the deal’s prospects. “If you put this on the floor, it will pass,” one White House official said.

Some White House aides also privately held out hope that Trump wouldn’t go forward with the tariffs, given the divide inside the administration over the move.

Senate Republicans were just coming off a high point after six of them trekked to the White House this spring and finally got Trump to back off the steel and aluminum tariffs on allies, raising hopes for passage of the new trade deal. A legislative effort to restrict Trump’s national security tariff authority had stalled, but the GOP found that diplomacy could move Trump — though it took them a year to do it.

This time around Trump is moving so quickly that Republicans’ tariff legislation wouldn’t even block the new tariffs on Mexico. Rather than saber rattle over another round of legislative battles with the president, most Republicans prefer to hash things out behind closed doors.

“I don’t even want to think about it,” said Sen. John Cornyn of the potential economic fallout that could hit his state if Trump slaps tariffs on Mexico. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo

“Sometimes in his frustration [Trump] expresses the intent to do certain things, but after calm reflection and consultation with the members of the Congress has decided maybe to pursue a different course,” Cornyn said. “Legislation obviously requires a presidential signature. The better course is to have some discussions in private.”

The president’s relations Congress had already devolved into a worsening spectacle in recent weeks.

The White House is trying to ease tensions with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who railed against the administration’s decision last week to send a draft statement to Congress that paves the way for moving forward with a vote on the trade deal. Pelosi viewed the move, which the White House downplayed as a procedural step, as an effort to cut short lawmakers’ review of the trade deal and ratchet up pressure on Congress to quickly pass it.

Democrats so far have been dismissive of Trump’s latest tariff threat. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) raised her concerns about the tariffs during a closed-door leadership meeting on Monday night. In response, Pelosi suggested it was one of Trump’s diversions to distract from last week’s statement from Robert Mueller about the Russia investigation, according to two sources familiar with the exchange.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke directly to Pelosi to explain that last week’s USMCA statement wasn’t intending to force lawmakers’ hands, according to a person familiar with the matter. White House staffers have also talked to Pelosi’s staff this week about both the possible tariffs and the speaker’s frustrations with the White House’s handling of the USMCA statement, the person said.

Trump administration officials are fanning out to address the tensions in coming days.

Lighthizer is scheduled to hold calls and meetings with five lawmakers this week as part of his ongoing push to sell the USMCA. Vice President Mike Pence plans to make another pitch for passage of the trade deal during a speech in Pennsylvania on Thursday, officials said.

Trump administration officials also must navigate a sharp backlash among investors and businesses, which see the tariffs as a major threat to the economy and stock market.

“We’re taking it seriously and we’re operating as if it is going to go into effect,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly opposes the tariffs. “This wasn’t an off-handed comment, responding to a question or a social media post. The White House released a detailed proposal.”

Business groups are warning that the tariffs would raise consumer prices on everything from automobiles to avocados. An analysis by the Chamber found that a 5 percent tariff would result in a potential tax increase on U.S. businesses and consumers of $17 billion. That would jump to $86 billion if the tariffs were to reach 25 percent, which Trump said would happen on Oct. 1 if no agreement has been reached.

Trump's tariff threat is also forcing business groups to reroute advocacy efforts to get the USMCA passed by Congress. The Chamber, which has been working with the National Association of Manufacturers and more than 200 organizations to lobby for USMCA passage, is expected to focus its efforts on pushing for a reversal of the Mexico tariffs if they go into effect.

Foreign officials are joining the business groups in their opposition campaign. Canadian and Mexican officials, shocked by the latest tariff threat, publicly insisted that the USMCA trade deal is still on track. But in private, officials from both countries were scrambling to better understand the fallout from the announcement.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a tariff on all Mexican goods will likely go into effect next week, despite a summit meeting between U.S. and Mexican officials scheduled for Wednesday.

""We are going to see if we can do something, but I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on — and we will probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on,"" Trump said during a press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May.

""Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try to enter our country and they could stop it very quickly. I think they will,"" Trump said. “If they won't, we're going to put tariffs on.”

Top Mexican officials have been in Washington since the weekend crafting a proposal to offer the U.S. that would persuade Trump to drop his plans to slap a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods starting June 10.

Mexico will present its proposal in at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Other U.S. officials, such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, will be present.

“We have to respond with forceful measures, but at the same time maintain a strong dialogue,” Jesús Seade, Mexico’s undersecretary for North America, said Tuesday after a meeting with Lighthizer.

Seade said Lighthizer is “extremely worried” that both countries will not reach a deal and Trump will go ahead with the tariffs. The top Mexican official added that it’s not Lighthizer’s call to make because he does not oversee immigration issues.

“I insisted that [U.S. officials] need to moderate their level of ambition. We’re making a large number of changes to better our migration control mechanisms,” Seade said. “But at the same time, they’re things that take time.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard was confident that U.S. and Mexican officials would be able to reach an agreement on Wednesday.

“I think we have 80 percent in favor of a deal — 20 percent maybe it’s difficult to reach an agreement right now,” Ebrard said during a press conference at the Mexican Embassy.

“Right now, our scenario is that, yes, we’ll probably have a deal, but if there were to not be one, we are prepared,” Ebrard added.

Ebrard said that he expects Mexico will know if a deal is possible after the meeting on Wednesday. In the event there is no deal, Mexico will announce its response on Thursday.

After meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ebrard said he plans to show U.S. officials the extent to which it has accommodated Central American migrants passing through Mexico by offering them work permits and job opportunities.

“The people coming here are not Mexicans mainly; 85 percent are from Central America. So that’s why we need to share a vision about the issue,” he said.

He added that the Mexican government has returned roughly 80,000 migrants to their home countries, while around 250,000 migrants are now working in Mexico. “Mexico is doing a lot of things in Mexico,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Ebrard said Mexico’s proposal has been informed by the various meetings U.S. and Mexican officials have had in recent days. Ebrard said he met with Kevin McAleenan, acting Homeland Security secretary, over the weekend “so we could have a clear vision of what they want” ahead of the Wednesday meeting.

It remains unclear what it will take for the Trump administration to drop its plan to impose the tariffs. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Mexico to ""immediately"" stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs to the border, but Mexico has already said that is not possible.

Mexico is expected to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in the event the two sides cannot reach a deal. Those tariffs would likely target part of Trump’s base, American farmers, who exports billions of dollars in farm goods to Mexico each year.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has repeatedly been positive despite Trump’s strong threats. López Obrador insisted on Sunday that Mexico “is friend to the U.S. government. The president of Mexico wants to continue being a friend of President Trump.”

Based on Trump's comments, it's also unclear whether Mexican officials’ message of cooperation, not tariffs, has resonated with Trump officials.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Monday met with Mexico’s Economy Secretary Graciela Márquez to discuss the situation, and said in a statement afterward that he “reiterated the president’s message that Mexico needs to do more to help the U.S. address immigration across our shared border.”

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a tariff on all Mexican goods will likely go into effect next week, despite a summit meeting between U.S. and Mexican officials scheduled for Wednesday.

""We are going to see if we can do something, but I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on — and we will probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on,"" Trump said during a press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May.

""Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try to enter our country and they could stop it very quickly. I think they will,"" Trump said. “If they won't, we're going to put tariffs on.”

Top Mexican officials have been in Washington since the weekend crafting a proposal to offer the U.S. that would persuade Trump to drop his plans to slap a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods starting June 10.

Mexico will present its proposal in at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Other U.S. officials, such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, will be present.

237,FCC votes to curb unwanted robocalls,John Hendel,"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai noted robocalls remain by far the commission’s top complaint and said battling the nuisance is a top priority. | Win McNamee/Getty Images technology FCC votes to curb unwanted robocalls

The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to let wireless carriers automatically block unwanted robocalls for their subscribers unless they opt out, despite some businesses' outcry that this could make it harder to reach customers.

The volume of calls has kept rising despite federal efforts to rein them in. Nearly 48 billion robocalls were made in the U.S. last year, estimates YouMail, a firm that offers call-blocking services.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai noted robocalls remain by far the commission’s top complaint and said battling the nuisance is a top priority. ""My message to the American people today is simple: we hear you and we are on your side,"" he said going into Thursday's vote.

Pai also kickstarted a regulatory process to start gathering public input on whether the FCC should require phone companies to authenticate calls to make sure they're really coming from the number that pops up on caller ID.

Scammers and other robocallers often use so-called ""spoofed"" numbers to make a call seem like it's coming from a local number or even a legitimate caller like the IRS. Call spoofing has existed for decades but became trivially easy to pull off with the proliferation of internet-based calling in recent years.

The telecom industry is currently working to voluntarily adopt a set of technology standards for authenticating calls. But Pai reiterated a threat to regulate if phone companies don't have the tech in place by the end of this year.

""To date I have been pleased by the progress industry has made"" toward the year-end goal, he said. ""But in case it isn’t, the FCC will not hesitate to take regulatory action.""

All five FCC commissioners voted to approve the item. But Republican Mike O'Rielly and Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel broke with the chairman on certain points, lodging their objections as partial dissents.

O'Rielly took issue with what he called ""breathtakingly expansive"" authority the FCC asserted to collect information from carriers in order to assemble reports on the implementation call blocking and authentication. Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks had secured the inclusion of language to do so as the agency negotiated the terms of the item ahead of the vote.

And Rosenworcel said the FCC should have told carriers they have to make call blocking free for subscribers. The agency made no such requirement, a move Rosenworcel called ""devastating.""

""I do not think that this agency should pat itself on the back for its efforts to reduce robocalls and then tell consumers to pay up,"" she said.

Following the meeting, Pai told reporters he expects carriers will voluntarily make their blocking technology free.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201711/2609/1155968404_5646509429001_5644790082001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

AT&T and Verizon issued separate statements welcoming the FCC vote, as did their trade group USTelecom. Yet a host of business trade associations, including health-care administration, credit union and banking groups, had raised objections to the FCC action ahead of the vote, worried about their ability to make lawful calls to their customers. They had asked the commission to delay the vote.

Pai dismissed such grievances during Thursday’s meeting.

“This FCC will stand with American consumers, not with those who are badgering them with these unwanted robocalls,” Pai said. He acknowledged that legitimate callers have raised concerns but noted the rule changes include a mandate that providers offering automatic call blocking must invite complaints from any party that feels its calls are being unfairly blocked and to stop blocking those calls if they're indeed found not to be nuisances.

Nevertheless, some groups were still troubled by the vote. “We remain disappointed,” National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Union general counsel Carrie Hunt said in a statement. The group believes “necessary and time-sensitive calls and texts would still be significantly delayed or prevented entirely as a result of this policy,” she said.

“In the event of fraud or a data breach, consumers could be left in the dark for days, exposing their financial accounts to increased risks and theft,” Hunt added.

The FCC action comes as Congress turns increased attention to unwanted robocalls. The Senate last month overwhelmingly passed a bill that would force phone companies to identify spam calls to consumers, increase fines for illegal robocalls and extend the statute of limitations for authorities to prosecute offenders.

The House Democratic majority is declining to take up that measure for now, instead preferring to negotiate a broader legislative package that it believes will accomplish the same as the Senate bill and more. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations have objected to current drafts of some of the Democratic bills that could form the basis of that package.

But top House Energy and Commerce Republican Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) suggested this week that negotiations are going well and that House legislation may be ready for markup soon.

“I think we may be in a really good place,” Walden told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We’ve had really productive discussions.”

The Trump administration Wednesday imposed new restrictions on federal use of fetal tissue obtained from abortions, barring government scientists at NIH from doing such research, and canceling an existing HIV research contract with the University of California, San Francisco.

HHS also said it will impose new ethics reviews on government-funded research at universities and other scientific centers seeking to use fetal tissue, potentially affecting more than $100 million in contracts. It will also continue to explore if there are alternatives to using tissue derived from abortion at all, an initiative that has divided the health department since it was announced last year.

“Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration,” HHS said in a statement. “[NIH internal] research that requires new acquisition of fetal tissue from elective abortions will not be conducted.”

The decision came after a heated debate within the Trump administration that pitted the White House against HHS, which sought a less restrictive policy, two officials told POLITICO.

Anti-abortion groups — which had pushed the Trump administration to cancel all contracts that involved fetal tissue research, arguing that the work is unethical — celebrated the move. “This is a major pro-life victory,"" Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said.

But research groups like the International Society for Stem Cell Research warned that the decision puts medical research at risk, saying that scientists rely on fetal tissue to develop vaccines and develop cures for degenerative diseases. In the past, fetal tissue research has contributed to such scientific breakthroughs as vaccines for polio, chicken pox and hepatitis A.

The stem cell society also decried the suggestion that their research was encouraging women to have abortions.

""There is no evidence that the use of donated tissue from fetal remains has any effect on whether women choose abortions, and no evidence that decades of research using donated tissue has ever led to an increase in the number of abortions,"" said Alta Charo of the University of Wisconsin.

The UCSF contract, which sought to find new HIV therapies, was due to expire Wednesday after the Trump administration granted a 90-day extension. UCSF officials said the decision ends the university's 30-year partnership with NIH, which required fetal tissue to search for HIV cures.

""We believe this decision to be politically motivated, shortsighted and not based on sound science,"" UCSF Chancellor Sam Hawgood said in a statement.

HHS currently funds about 200 outside projects that use fetal tissue obtained from abortion, but those contracts will not be immediately affected or undergo additional review, an agency spokesperson said. HHS will appoint an ethics advisory board to review future research projects that use fetal tissue and seek federal funding.

Three active NIH projects use fetal tissue from abortions, the HHS spokesperson said, without offering further details.

The new restrictions had been closely guarded and fiercely debated within the Trump administration. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and domestic policy chief Joe Grogan had pushed for the outright ban on NIH using fetal tissue obtained from abortion, said the two officials with knowledge of those conversations.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar had argued for a less restrictive policy that would have allowed ongoing research on tissue acquired from research institutions, those officials told POLITICO.

The White House said that the administration was unified on its new fetal tissue policy. “This was the President’s decision, not a Joe Grogan or Alex Azar decision,” said deputy press secretary Judd Deere.

The controversy over federal use of fetal tissue exploded in 2015 when an anti-abortion group released videos purportedly showing Planned Parenthood profiting from sale of the tissues. Planned Parenthood said the videos were edited to be intentionally misleading, and a Texas grand jury subsequently cleared the organization of any wrongdoing. But the furor continued, and the Justice Department has probed Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue contracts.

Prompted by anti-abortion groups, Trump’s health department conducted a six-month review of federal use of fetal tissue. Anti-abortion advocates — including David Daleiden, who made the videos — hailed today's outcome but said they were expecting the Trump administration to further crack down on research funding.

""It was a good step, but a preliminary step to stop the trafficking in fetal tissue,"" David Prentice of the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute said on a call with reporters. ""We look forward to more.""

Three active NIH projects use fetal tissue from abortions, the HHS spokesperson said, without offering further details.

The new restrictions had been closely guarded and fiercely debated within the Trump administration. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and domestic policy chief Joe Grogan had pushed for the outright ban on NIH using fetal tissue obtained from abortion, said the two officials with knowledge of those conversations.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar had argued for a less restrictive policy that would have allowed ongoing research on tissue acquired from research institutions, those officials told POLITICO.

The White House said that the administration was unified on its new fetal tissue policy. “This was the President’s decision, not a Joe Grogan or Alex Azar decision,” said deputy press secretary Judd Deere.

The controversy over federal use of fetal tissue exploded in 2015 when an anti-abortion group released videos purportedly showing Planned Parenthood profiting from sale of the tissues. Planned Parenthood said the videos were edited to be intentionally misleading, and a Texas grand jury subsequently cleared the organization of any wrongdoing. But the furor continued, and the Justice Department has probed Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue contracts.

Prompted by anti-abortion groups, Trump’s health department conducted a six-month review of federal use of fetal tissue. Anti-abortion advocates — including David Daleiden, who made the videos — hailed today's outcome but said they were expecting the Trump administration to further crack down on research funding.

""It was a good step, but a preliminary step to stop the trafficking in fetal tissue,"" David Prentice of the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute said on a call with reporters. ""We look forward to more.""

The Trump administration Wednesday imposed new restrictions on federal use of fetal tissue obtained from abortions, barring government scientists at NIH from doing such research, and canceling an existing HIV research contract with the University of California, San Francisco.

HHS also said it will impose new ethics reviews on government-funded research at universities and other scientific centers seeking to use fetal tissue, potentially affecting more than $100 million in contracts. It will also continue to explore if there are alternatives to using tissue derived from abortion at all, an initiative that has divided the health department since it was announced last year.

243,Liberals fight their own party over drug prices,Adam Cancryn,"Top Democrats have struggled with progressives for much of the year over drug pricing. “People have not been included,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (left). | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images health care Liberals fight their own party over drug prices Progressives vent that many of their rank-and-file are in the dark about where leadership is heading.

House Democratic leaders are facing deep skepticism from their progressive wing over a plan empowering the government to limit prices for some expensive prescription drugs — a rift that could hurt the party on an issue that has also been embraced by President Donald Trump.

Liberal lawmakers and like-minded advocacy groups say the preliminary drug pricing plan pitched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is far too timid a response to spiraling U.S. drug costs, and could fail to leverage the government’s massive purchasing power in demanding cheaper medicines.

Story Continued Below

Democratic leaders have focused on a concept that grants federal officials new authority to negotiate prices for a select group of drugs and quickly rein in the nation's priciest medicines, possibly forming the basis of a broader bipartisan drug pricing deal. But progressives want far more expansive changes, pushing to give the government sweeping power to set prices across the board — and punish pharmaceutical companies that fail to fall in line.

The tensions are delaying House Democrats’ bid to make good on a chief campaign promise, frustrating lawmakers eager for progress on the health care issue. And it’s unfolding in the shadow of a bigger intraparty fight over single-payer health care, or ""Medicare for All,"" that’s playing out in Congress and on the 2020 presidential campaign trail.

The drug pricing effort now risks stretching into the fall, leaving Democrats with a narrow window for securing a major win before the 2020 race swamps Washington.

“People have not been included,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “There has been no process up to now.""

Top Democrats have struggled with progressives for much of the year over drug pricing, trying to overcome suspicions that leadership will ultimately stop short of a crackdown on the influential drug industry.

House progressives early this year roundly rejected using a third party to set prices for drugs through binding arbitration, blasting the idea broached by leadership as opaque and overly cautious.

A revised plan outlined in recent weeks by Pelosi hasn’t fared much better. It seeks to assuage liberals by empowering the Government Accountability Office to decide drug prices rather than an outside entity, and requires HHS to negotiate the price of at least 25 medicines per year. The resulting prices would then be applied to the entire U.S. market.

But leading progressives remain wary, and vented this week that much of the rank-and-file remains in the dark on where Pelosi’s office is headed.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the other co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, told POLITICO on Tuesday that she has a list of questions for Democratic leadership staff about their drug pricing work demanding details after the latest plan raised “lots of concerns” about whether it would make a significant dent in the prices Americans pay for their prescription drugs.

Pocan voiced concerns to House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) during a closed-door session later in the day about going public with any proposal before the caucus has a chance to weigh in.

“We just want to make sure that everyone is brought on board,"" Pocan said after the session, which was billed as a drug pricing roundtable aimed at new members. ""What I’m really afraid of is we set the whole cause back and we wind up having nothing done.""

A Jeffries spokesperson called the meeting — which included several advocacy groups — an effort to introduce interested lawmakers to key players working on drug price issues, not a discussion about a single legislative proposal.

Leaders stress they’ve yet to finalize any drug price plan and are still refining concepts that will be more ambitious and far-reaching than critics suggest. On Tuesday, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told reporters the caucus will have plenty of time to publicly weigh a range of plans.

“We’ll have a hearing on many different proposals,” he said. “There isn’t one party position at this point.”

Still, the closely guarded and drawn-out process — which has included discussions between top Pelosi health aide Wendell Primus and the White House — has frustrated progressive Democrats who fret that six months into their House majority, there’s been little measurable progress and even less communication about the centerpiece of the party’s drug price pledge.

“If there’s to be good collaboration, there needs to be more openness,” said Ways and Means health subcommittee chair Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who is pushing his own sweeping drug price reforms. “We talk about transparency in drug pricing. We need a little transparency on the process.”

It wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. House Democratic leaders had once planned to unveil a plan as early as February.

But questions about the scope of the government's role have since fractured the caucus. Progressive Democrats are throwing their weight behind Doggett’s proposal permitting the government to strip drug makers of their patent protections if they refuse to negotiate prices in good faith.

Moderate Democrats view the approach as too blunt of an instrument to threaten a complex industry that, for all its flaws, still develops life-saving medicines.

Democratic leaders' search for a middle ground is based on a belief they can still unite the party and potentially garner support from President Donald Trump, who has long pledged to dramatically cut drug prices.

The most recent outline would mandate that HHS try negotiating an acceptable price for at least 25 drugs a year with their manufacturers, based on pricing and development information collected from the companies, sources familiar with the proposal said. GAO would oversee a “dispute resolution” process and set the final price if HHS and the companies fail to reach an agreement.

Companies that refuse to submit to the process would get hit with a 50 percent excise tax on the prior-year sales of each drug in question. And medicines not subject to negotiation would face penalties if their manufacturers hike prices above a certain threshold — an effort to prevent drug makers from jacking up prices elsewhere.

Key details have yet to be fleshed out, most notably which drugs would qualify for negotiation. That’s an element that skeptics say is crucial, especially amid concerns the plan would target only a select set of drugs.

“It doesn’t seem aggressive enough to me,” Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said of the outline, questioning whether it would drive broad price reductions. “I worry about not catching some of the real abuses.”

Leadership allies and some advocacy groups have urged patience, chalking up the delays to caution over possibly jeopardizing a potential major political and policy victory.

They argued that the proposal outlined by Pelosi could serve as the foundation for a hard-hitting bill that first targets the highest-cost drugs like insulin and some cancer therapies and imposes sweeping restrictions on the broader industry.

“Congress should focus on price negotiations on key drugs for the same reason that bank robbers rob banks: Because that’s where all the money is,” said Ben Wakana, executive director for Patients for Affordable Drugs. “It is really a handful of two dozen drugs that are driving the majority of the spending in Medicare.”

Even some progressives allow that there are reasons for optimism. Pocan praised the suggestion that negotiated prices would apply across the entire market even as he dismissed other elements of the plan as “horrendous”; others called Pelosi's latest outline a decent first step.

“It’s a good start,” said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.). “We should be being more aggressive.”

But the secrecy surrounding leadership’s work has put the liberal bloc on edge.

More than one Democrat in recent weeks has compared the drug price process to Republicans’ desperate bid to shield their Obamacare repeal bill from public view — and members of their own party — back in 2017. Several others lamented that they’ve learned more about leadership’s efforts from press reports than top Democrats themselves.

And Pocan on Tuesday emphasized that Democrats won the House in part on promises of major drug pricing action — and that the party needs to take the time to ensure it follows through with an ambitious, unified proposal.

“If we don’t address this in a big and bold way, a lot of us should go home and start knitting,” he said, adding that he hopes Democratic leaders won’t try to jam the rest of the caucus on such a high-stakes issue. “To me, if the conversation ends in two weeks, we got screwed.”

House Democratic leaders are facing deep skepticism from their progressive wing over a plan empowering the government to limit prices for some expensive prescription drugs — a rift that could hurt the party on an issue that has also been embraced by President Donald Trump.

Liberal lawmakers and like-minded advocacy groups say the preliminary drug pricing plan pitched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is far too timid a response to spiraling U.S. drug costs, and could fail to leverage the government’s massive purchasing power in demanding cheaper medicines.

Democratic leaders have focused on a concept that grants federal officials new authority to negotiate prices for a select group of drugs and quickly rein in the nation's priciest medicines, possibly forming the basis of a broader bipartisan drug pricing deal. But progressives want far more expansive changes, pushing to give the government sweeping power to set prices across the board — and punish pharmaceutical companies that fail to fall in line.

The tensions are delaying House Democrats’ bid to make good on a chief campaign promise, frustrating lawmakers eager for progress on the health care issue. And it’s unfolding in the shadow of a bigger intraparty fight over single-payer health care, or ""Medicare for All,"" that’s playing out in Congress and on the 2020 presidential campaign trail.

The drug pricing effort now risks stretching into the fall, leaving Democrats with a narrow window for securing a major win before the 2020 race swamps Washington.

“People have not been included,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “There has been no process up to now.""

Top Democrats have struggled with progressives for much of the year over drug pricing, trying to overcome suspicions that leadership will ultimately stop short of a crackdown on the influential drug industry.

House progressives early this year roundly rejected using a third party to set prices for drugs through binding arbitration, blasting the idea broached by leadership as opaque and overly cautious.

A revised plan outlined in recent weeks by Pelosi hasn’t fared much better. It seeks to assuage liberals by empowering the Government Accountability Office to decide drug prices rather than an outside entity, and requires HHS to negotiate the price of at least 25 medicines per year. The resulting prices would then be applied to the entire U.S. market.

But leading progressives remain wary, and vented this week that much of the rank-and-file remains in the dark on where Pelosi’s office is headed.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the other co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, told POLITICO on Tuesday that she has a list of questions for Democratic leadership staff about their drug pricing work demanding details after the latest plan raised “lots of concerns” about whether it would make a significant dent in the prices Americans pay for their prescription drugs.

Pocan voiced concerns to House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) during a closed-door session later in the day about going public with any proposal before the caucus has a chance to weigh in.

“We just want to make sure that everyone is brought on board,"" Pocan said after the session, which was billed as a drug pricing roundtable aimed at new members. ""What I’m really afraid of is we set the whole cause back and we wind up having nothing done.""

A Jeffries spokesperson called the meeting — which included several advocacy groups — an effort to introduce interested lawmakers to key players working on drug price issues, not a discussion about a single legislative proposal.

Leaders stress they’ve yet to finalize any drug price plan and are still refining concepts that will be more ambitious and far-reaching than critics suggest. On Tuesday, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told reporters the caucus will have plenty of time to publicly weigh a range of plans.

“We’ll have a hearing on many different proposals,” he said. “There isn’t one party position at this point.”

Still, the closely guarded and drawn-out process — which has included discussions between top Pelosi health aide Wendell Primus and the White House — has frustrated progressive Democrats who fret that six months into their House majority, there’s been little measurable progress and even less communication about the centerpiece of the party’s drug price pledge.

“If there’s to be good collaboration, there needs to be more openness,” said Ways and Means health subcommittee chair Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who is pushing his own sweeping drug price reforms. “We talk about transparency in drug pricing. We need a little transparency on the process.”

It wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. House Democratic leaders had once planned to unveil a plan as early as February.

But questions about the scope of the government's role have since fractured the caucus. Progressive Democrats are throwing their weight behind Doggett’s proposal permitting the government to strip drug makers of their patent protections if they refuse to negotiate prices in good faith.

Moderate Democrats view the approach as too blunt of an instrument to threaten a complex industry that, for all its flaws, still develops life-saving medicines.

Democratic leaders' search for a middle ground is based on a belief they can still unite the party and potentially garner support from President Donald Trump, who has long pledged to dramatically cut drug prices.

The most recent outline would mandate that HHS try negotiating an acceptable price for at least 25 drugs a year with their manufacturers, based on pricing and development information collected from the companies, sources familiar with the proposal said. GAO would oversee a “dispute resolution” process and set the final price if HHS and the companies fail to reach an agreement.

Companies that refuse to submit to the process would get hit with a 50 percent excise tax on the prior-year sales of each drug in question. And medicines not subject to negotiation would face penalties if their manufacturers hike prices above a certain threshold — an effort to prevent drug makers from jacking up prices elsewhere.

Key details have yet to be fleshed out, most notably which drugs would qualify for negotiation. That’s an element that skeptics say is crucial, especially amid concerns the plan would target only a select set of drugs.

“It doesn’t seem aggressive enough to me,” Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said of the outline, questioning whether it would drive broad price reductions. “I worry about not catching some of the real abuses.”

Leadership allies and some advocacy groups have urged patience, chalking up the delays to caution over possibly jeopardizing a potential major political and policy victory.

They argued that the proposal outlined by Pelosi could serve as the foundation for a hard-hitting bill that first targets the highest-cost drugs like insulin and some cancer therapies and imposes sweeping restrictions on the broader industry.

“Congress should focus on price negotiations on key drugs for the same reason that bank robbers rob banks: Because that’s where all the money is,” said Ben Wakana, executive director for Patients for Affordable Drugs. “It is really a handful of two dozen drugs that are driving the majority of the spending in Medicare.”

Even some progressives allow that there are reasons for optimism. Pocan praised the suggestion that negotiated prices would apply across the entire market even as he dismissed other elements of the plan as “horrendous”; others called Pelosi's latest outline a decent first step.

“It’s a good start,” said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.). “We should be being more aggressive.”

But the secrecy surrounding leadership’s work has put the liberal bloc on edge.

More than one Democrat in recent weeks has compared the drug price process to Republicans’ desperate bid to shield their Obamacare repeal bill from public view — and members of their own party — back in 2017. Several others lamented that they’ve learned more about leadership’s efforts from press reports than top Democrats themselves.

And Pocan on Tuesday emphasized that Democrats won the House in part on promises of major drug pricing action — and that the party needs to take the time to ensure it follows through with an ambitious, unified proposal.

“If we don’t address this in a big and bold way, a lot of us should go home and start knitting,” he said, adding that he hopes Democratic leaders won’t try to jam the rest of the caucus on such a high-stakes issue. “To me, if the conversation ends in two weeks, we got screwed.”

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo congress Senate Intelligence Committee summons mysterious British security consultant

Senate investigators have added yet another name to the constantly evolving cast of characters in the Russia investigation.

On April 5, just 2 weeks after Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted his final report on Russia’s election interference, the Senate Intelligence Committee sent a letter to a British security consultant named Walter Soriano asking for a voluntary, closed-door interview and documents with various Russia probe figures dating back to June 2015.

Story Continued Below

The letter, obtained by Politico, offers yet another window into the panel’s secretive — but largely bipartisan — two-year-old investigation, and reveals the investigators’ interest in what, if any, role Israel may have played in attempts to manipulate the 2016 election.

The panel’s interest in Soriano is not a mere fishing expedition, according to a source familiar with the investigators’ internal deliberations who requested anonymity to discuss them freely.

“They’re surprised by how connected he seems to several people of interest,” this person said, including the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska — a former business associate of Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who offered Deripaska private briefings about the campaign in 2016. Deripaska is believed to have worked with Soriano on corporate intelligence matters, this person said.

On April 5, the committee sent a bipartisan request to Soriano at the London address for his security firm, USG Security Limited. The letter asked for “all communications or records of communications” with some characters who have by now become household names, like Manafort and Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The committee also requested Soriano’s communications with three Israeli private intelligence firms: Psy Group, Wikistrat, and Black Cube, as well as any communications he may have had with Orbis Business Intelligence, a firm co-founded by the former British spy Christopher Steele.

A committee spokeswoman declined to comment. A lawyer for Soriano did not return a request for comment. It's not clear whether, or how, Soriano responded to the committee's letter.

Soriano is virtually a ghost online, aside from publicly available corporate records listing him as the director of a London-based security firm called USG Security. He has been accused in the Israeli press of spying on police officers involved in the corruption probe of Israeli prime minister Bibi Netanyahu—an allegation he’s staunchly denied. Soriano also produced a documentary about Netanyahu’s late brother, Yoni Netanyahu, who died leading Israel’s raid on Entebbe Airport in Uganda in 1976.

It isn’t clear why the Senate committee believes Soriano may have a connection to the private Israeli firms — one of which, Psy Group, was enlisted by Trump’s deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates in 2016 to use social media manipulation to help Trump beat his Republican primary opponents and Hillary Clinton. Psy Group’s founder Joel Zamel also owns WikiStrat, which reportedly gamed out how to successfully interfere in an election as early as 2015. Black Cube is one of Zamel’s main rivals, according to the Wall Street Journal.

249,Russia's manipulation of Twitter was far vaster than believed,Tim Starks,"Russia's troll farm was found to have considerably more sway than previously thought and might have generated income for some of its phony accounts. | Naira Davlashyan/AP Photo cybersecurity Russia's manipulation of Twitter was far vaster than believed

Russia's infamous troll farm conducted a campaign on Twitter before the 2016 elections that was larger, more coordinated and more effective than previously known, research from cybersecurity firm Symantec out Wednesday concluded.

The Internet Research Agency campaign may not only have had more sway — reaching large numbers of real users — than previously thought, it also demonstrated ample patience and might have generated income for some of the phony accounts, Symantec found.

Their research analyzed a massive data set that Twitter released in October 2018 on nearly 3,900 suspended accounts and 10 million tweets. It discovered that the average lag between account creation and first tweet was 177 days and the most retweeted account garnered 6 million retweets, and less than 2,000 of those came from within the IRA-linked network of accounts.

The huge delay between the creation of an account and the initial tweet points to a lot of patient preparation, and the retweets indicate that a lot of unaffiliated Twitter users were amplifying the IRA's message.

For some lawmakers, revelations about the broader scope of Russian disinformation on Twitter are a stark reminder that the U.S. government has precious little time to safeguard the 2020 election from foreign interference.

""In terms of the sophistication, there is a group of us who are looking at what we can do to protect ourselves in 2020,"" said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA analyst who urged her fellow lawmakers to adopt the sweeping House bill that includes provisions to strengthen security safeguards at the polls although it does not specifically deal with social media disinformation.

""[T]here's a whole half of [special counsel Robert] Mueller report that's just about straight old-fashioned Russian information warfare. We've been educating ourselves so that we can push forward legislation to fill some of those holes,"" she said, suggesting that lawmakers have a way to go in finding a legislative fix to the online disinformation problem.

For Congress, a major roadblock is just understanding how tech companies police their platforms — and what they can do to prevent a repeat of 2016.

""Our response to bad content on social media is generally to say it should be taken down. That's because that's something we as politicians who are not technical experts understand,"" said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), former assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

""What we've had a harder time grasping is the virality machine that's built into the social networks through the algorithms that determine what news we see on a daily basis,"" he said.

Lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad have increased pressure on social media companies to do more to stop the spread of disinformation, and companies such as Twitter and Facebook have responded by updating their policies and removing troll accounts and false information.

But ridding the platforms of false information is a tough challenge both for lawmakers and social media platforms, Malinowski acknowledged.

""It's difficult because it would mean challenging the business models of these companies,"" he said.

While most of the accounts that Symantec reviewed were automated, many frequently demonstrated evidence of manual manipulation, such as slight wording changes in an apparent bid to dodge detection, according to Symantec.

""While this propaganda campaign has often been referred to as the work of trolls, the release of the dataset makes it obvious that it was far more than that,"" the company wrote. ""It was planned months in advance and the operators had the resources to create and manage a vast disinformation network.""

Some accounts also appeared to generate revenue via URL shorteners, with one account even earning as much as $1 million, although those were apparently rogue accounts operating outside the IRA's main mission.

Russia's infamous troll farm conducted a campaign on Twitter before the 2016 elections that was larger, more coordinated and more effective than previously known, research from cybersecurity firm Symantec out Wednesday concluded.

The Internet Research Agency campaign may not only have had more sway — reaching large numbers of real users — than previously thought, it also demonstrated ample patience and might have generated income for some of the phony accounts, Symantec found.

Their research analyzed a massive data set that Twitter released in October 2018 on nearly 3,900 suspended accounts and 10 million tweets. It discovered that the average lag between account creation and first tweet was 177 days and the most retweeted account garnered 6 million retweets, and less than 2,000 of those came from within the IRA-linked network of accounts.

The huge delay between the creation of an account and the initial tweet points to a lot of patient preparation, and the retweets indicate that a lot of unaffiliated Twitter users were amplifying the IRA's message.

For some lawmakers, revelations about the broader scope of Russian disinformation on Twitter are a stark reminder that the U.S. government has precious little time to safeguard the 2020 election from foreign interference.

253,FBI agent: Russian official tried to arrange Trump-Putin call for day after inauguration,Darren Samuelsohn,"Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s case took several unexpected twists on Thursday as it inches toward closure. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo legal FBI agent: Russian official tried to arrange Trump-Putin call for day after inauguration The bureau learned about the Russian ambassador’s attempt while interviewing Michael Flynn early in the administration.

A top Russian official tried to set up a video teleconference between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the day after Trump’s inauguration, according to a senior FBI agent’s interview notes released on Thursday.

Peter Strzok, at the time a lead FBI agent investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, heard about the attempt to connect Trump and Putin while he and another bureau agent interviewed the president’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, at the White House just days into the new administration.

Story Continued Below

Flynn relayed that he’d gotten the request to arrange a Trump-Putin call from Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the U.S., when the two men spoke shortly after Christmas in 2016 as part of a broader conversation covering a range of issues important to the two countries.

U.S. and Russian officials have never confirmed that a conversation took place between Trump and Putin on Jan. 21, 2017, though the White House on Jan. 28 of that year offered a readout of a “congratulatory call” from the Russian leader that happened that day.

“The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,” the White House said at the time, describing a conversation lasting about one hour and involving issues including Syria and fighting Islamic terrorism.

John Dowd message for Robert Kelner

Federal prosecutors released Strzok’s notes from his Jan. 24, 2017, interview with Flynn as part of the ongoing case against the former top Trump aide, who still awaits sentencing stemming from his December 2017 guilty plea for lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

Strzok, a deputy FBI assistant director at the time of the Flynn interview, has been a top target for the president and his Republican allies after the disclosure that he’d sent a series of anti-Trump text messages to one of his colleagues. The FBI in August 2018 fired Strzok over the exchanges, a disciplinary move that Trump cited as reason to wrap up the Russia investigation that Strzok in its early stages had a senior role in leading.

Flynn’s case took several unexpected twists on Thursday as it inches toward closure. First, his longtime lawyers notified the presiding federal judge that their client had fired them and hired new attorneys. That move set off a raft of speculation in legal and political circles that Flynn is considering backing out of his plea deal with the government in a play for a presidential pardon.

Also on Thursday, federal prosecutors released the audio recording of a November 2017 voicemail left by John Dowd, Trump’s personal attorney at the time, to one of Flynn’s lawyers seeking information about discussions they were having with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators before Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty.

Mueller cited Dowd’s comments — he urged Flynn’s lawyers to “remember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn, and that still remains” — in the obstruction of justice section of the special counsel’s final report, which was released in April.

Strzok’s notes from the FBI agents’ interview with Flynn, known in bureau parlance as a “302” for the form an agent fills out, offer several more details about multiple conversations between the Trump aide and the Russian ambassador after the 2016 election.

According to Strzok’s write-up, Flynn called Kislyak twice around Christmas 2016 to express condolences for a pair of tragedies — the murder of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey and an airplane crash in which members of a Russian choir were killed. Both calls, Flynn told the FBI agents, were to maintain a good relationship with his Russian counterpart.

On Dec. 28 of that year, Kislyak also texted Flynn, who told the FBI agents he was traveling in the Dominican Republican at the time and had poor cellphone reception, so therefore didn’t call Kislyak until the following day. Flynn told the agents that when the two connected, they discussed setting up the video call between Trump and Putin, as well as picking a representative to a terrorism conference in Khazakhstan.

That call was the same day that then-President Barack Obama announced he would expel 35 Russian diplomats in response to Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. But Flynn said he didn’t recall any discussion with Kislyak about that. When agents pressed Flynn, asking specifically whether he had told Kislyak not to engage in a “tit-for-tat” with Obama, Flynn told them, “Not really.”

In Flynn’s guilty plea, he admitted that this version of events was untrue. He acknowledged speaking with a member of the Trump transition team about how to persuade Russia not to escalate the situation with the Obama administration, and immediately reported back to the team after his conversation with Kislyak. The next day, Putin agreed not to retaliate for the U.S. actions.

Flynn also told the FBI agents about the origins of his relationship with senior Russian officials, which began in 2013, when he was Obama’s defense intelligence chief. At the time, Flynn said, he was invited to the headquarters of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, for a “leadership development” program. Flynn met the head of the GRU, Igor Sergun, on that trip and kept in touch with him afterward, but their relationship abruptly ended when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.

Flynn told the FBI agents that he and Sergun had “common ground” — both discussed their experiences in military conflict, and both had sons of about the same age. Flynn called Kislyak in early 2016 to express condolences when Sergun died in Lebanon.

In his FBI interview, Flynn also recalled that his second trip to Russia came in late 2015, when he was famously invited to a gala hosted by RT, a Russian media outlet. Pictures of the event show that he was seated at the same table as Putin. Flynn told agents that he and his son paid a visit to Kislyak around the time of this trip as a courtesy — and he noted that he had received a “threat briefing” from the Defense Intelligence Agency before attending.","| Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo legal FBI agent: Russian official tried to arrange Trump-Putin call for day after inauguration The bureau learned about the Russian ambassador’s attempt while interviewing Michael Flynn early in the administration.

A top Russian official tried to set up a video teleconference between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the day after Trump’s inauguration, according to a senior FBI agent’s interview notes released on Thursday.

Peter Strzok, at the time a lead FBI agent investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, heard about the attempt to connect Trump and Putin while he and another bureau agent interviewed the president’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, at the White House just days into the new administration.

Flynn relayed that he’d gotten the request to arrange a Trump-Putin call from Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the U.S., when the two men spoke shortly after Christmas in 2016 as part of a broader conversation covering a range of issues important to the two countries.

U.S. and Russian officials have never confirmed that a conversation took place between Trump and Putin on Jan. 21, 2017, though the White House on Jan. 28 of that year offered a readout of a “congratulatory call” from the Russian leader that happened that day.

“The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,” the White House said at the time, describing a conversation lasting about one hour and involving issues including Syria and fighting Islamic terrorism.

Federal prosecutors released Strzok’s notes from his Jan. 24, 2017, interview with Flynn as part of the ongoing case against the former top Trump aide, who still awaits sentencing stemming from his December 2017 guilty plea for lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

Strzok, a deputy FBI assistant director at the time of the Flynn interview, has been a top target for the president and his Republican allies after the disclosure that he’d sent a series of anti-Trump text messages to one of his colleagues. The FBI in August 2018 fired Strzok over the exchanges, a disciplinary move that Trump cited as reason to wrap up the Russia investigation that Strzok in its early stages had a senior role in leading.

Flynn’s case took several unexpected twists on Thursday as it inches toward closure. First, his longtime lawyers notified the presiding federal judge that their client had fired them and hired new attorneys. That move set off a raft of speculation in legal and political circles that Flynn is considering backing out of his plea deal with the government in a play for a presidential pardon.

Also on Thursday, federal prosecutors released the audio recording of a November 2017 voicemail left by John Dowd, Trump’s personal attorney at the time, to one of Flynn’s lawyers seeking information about discussions they were having with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators before Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty.

Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn has fired his legal team as he awaits sentencing for lying to the FBI about his conversations with a top Russian official, according to a new filing Thursday from his longtime attorneys.

The lawyers, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, offered no explanation for their abrupt dismissal in a two-page motion delivered to the federal judge who will mete out Flynn’s punishment stemming from his 2017 guilty plea to special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors.

Story Continued Below

In their filing, the attorneys said Flynn had notified them that “he is terminating Covington & Burling LLP as his counsel and has already retained new counsel for this matter.”

They did not identify Flynn’s new legal team and declined comment when asked by POLITICO about who now represents the former senior Trump aide, who landed in legal trouble after lying about the subject of conversations he had with high-ranking Russian officials during the 2016 transition.

Flynn’s decision to change attorneys at this late stage is unusual and has triggered speculation in legal and political circles that he’s considering backing out of his plea deal with the government in a play for a presidential pardon. Sometimes defendants switch attorneys for mundane reasons such as financial issues, and Flynn’s allies have complained that the case has essentially bankrupted him.

John Dowd message for Robert Kelner

But the move also comes amid a yawning disconnect between the approach adopted by the well-respected legal team Flynn has used since the start of the Russia probe and the combative rhetoric from many of his friends and family members, who have accused Mueller’s team of deception and argued that Flynn was tricked into pleading guilty. Some have urged Flynn to seek to withdraw his plea.

Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump provocateur who has joined forces with the Flynn family in calling for the retired Army lieutenant general’s exoneration and pardon, wrote Thursday on Twitter that he was told the new Flynn lawyer is “very high profile and appears on TV regularly.” The post added to the speculation over several familiar faces from the Russia probe, including Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, retired Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and the husband-wife duo of Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, informal Trump advisers who nearly joined the president’s legal team last spring.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201712/731/1155968404_5664522436001_5664485776001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In a text message to POLITICO, Giuliani said he was not Flynn’s new lawyer. Dershowitz replied that he’s not representing Flynn. DiGenova in an email wrote, “We are not at liberty to discuss.”

Legal experts say the plea deal that Kelner and Anthony cut with Mueller’s team more than a year ago was a generous one, making it possible that Flynn would receive only probation. Trying to back out of the deal now could open Flynn to a variety of charges, including criminal liability related to unregistered lobbying work he did in 2016 on behalf of a foreign client allegedly acting as a front for Turkey.

Flynn’s ex-business partner and the alleged middleman were indicted in the case, but Flynn escaped charges, apparently due to his plea deal. In a joint status report in March, attorneys for Flynn and Mueller told U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan that Flynn could testify in the mid-July trial against his former partner, Bijan Rafiekian.

The Turkey lobbying case is one big reason for the delay in Flynn’s sentencing, which had originally been scheduled for last December but ended up getting postponed after an unexpectedly contentious hearing during which Sullivan repeatedly criticized Flynn, telling him at one point, “Arguably, you sold your country out.”

Sullivan ultimately convinced Flynn to request a delay in his sentencing until he’d done all he could to satisfy the government as part of his cooperation agreement — an offer Flynn has accepted twice.

The next joint status report from Flynn’s legal team and the Justice Department is due June 14. In their letter, Kelner and Anthony noted that Sullivan has the power to deny their motion to withdraw as lawyers if it would slow the trial or harm the integrity of the case, but suggested there was no reason for him to do that.

“As only sentencing remains in this case, sentencing has not yet been scheduled and General Flynn has already retained new counsel, withdrawal at this time would not be prejudicial to any of the parties or otherwise inconsistent with the interests of justice,” the attorneys wrote.

Later Thursday, Sullivan issued a brief one-paragraph order “denying without prejudice” the Flynn lawyers’ motion to withdraw, though it appears the decision centered on a technicality.

Sullivan, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the attorneys didn’t follow a local rule for the court to include the text of a proposed order for him to sign. They also failed “to indicate the manner in which the motion was served upon Mr. Flynn.”

The fired Flynn lawyers responded with a new motion that included the one-page draft order, as well as a notation that they had emailed and hand-delivered a copy of their filing to Flynn at his home address.

Flynn’s legal team turnover comes as some of his family members have used their Twitter feeds in recent days to air complaints about the federal prosecutors’ decision last week not to comply with a judge’s order to publicly file transcripts of intercepted phone calls Flynn conducted with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. The prosecution didn’t indicate precisely why it was rebuffing the judge’s request, but said simply that “it is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence.”

Sullivan issued another order Tuesday saying he would not require further filings on the subject. As of this point, Flynn’s defense has not noted any objection to the prosecution’s failure to provide the transcripts.

Flynn’s decision to shift legal teams is a mistake, said Peter Zeidenberg, a Washington defense attorney and former prosecutor in special counsel Pat Fitzgerald’s CIA-leak probe.

“This is a very foolish thing to do. Flynn’s lawyers had positioned him to get probation for a single count of false statements. Given what he was facing, that is remarkable. It will go downhill from there,” Zeidenberg said.

Flynn “simply cannot do any better than that, under these circumstances,” he added. “If he tries to withdraw his plea, he is going to get pummeled. Unless he has gotten some signals that he may get pardoned — always a possibility — this makes no sense.”","Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn is awaiting sentencing in his case, and the next joint status report from his legal team and the Justice Department is due June 14.

Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn has fired his legal team as he awaits sentencing for lying to the FBI about his conversations with a top Russian official, according to a new filing Thursday from his longtime attorneys.

The lawyers, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, offered no explanation for their abrupt dismissal in a two-page motion delivered to the federal judge who will mete out Flynn’s punishment stemming from his 2017 guilty plea to special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors.

In their filing, the attorneys said Flynn had notified them that “he is terminating Covington & Burling LLP as his counsel and has already retained new counsel for this matter.”

They did not identify Flynn’s new legal team and declined comment when asked by POLITICO about who now represents the former senior Trump aide, who landed in legal trouble after lying about the subject of conversations he had with high-ranking Russian officials during the 2016 transition.

Flynn’s decision to change attorneys at this late stage is unusual and has triggered speculation in legal and political circles that he’s considering backing out of his plea deal with the government in a play for a presidential pardon. Sometimes defendants switch attorneys for mundane reasons such as financial issues, and Flynn’s allies have complained that the case has essentially bankrupted him.

But the move also comes amid a yawning disconnect between the approach adopted by the well-respected legal team Flynn has used since the start of the Russia probe and the combative rhetoric from many of his friends and family members, who have accused Mueller’s team of deception and argued that Flynn was tricked into pleading guilty. Some have urged Flynn to seek to withdraw his plea.

Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump provocateur who has joined forces with the Flynn family in calling for the retired Army lieutenant general’s exoneration and pardon, wrote Thursday on Twitter that he was told the new Flynn lawyer is “very high profile and appears on TV regularly.” The post added to the speculation over several familiar faces from the Russia probe, including Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, retired Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and the husband-wife duo of Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, informal Trump advisers who nearly joined the president’s legal team last spring.

In a text message to POLITICO, Giuliani said he was not Flynn’s new lawyer. Dershowitz replied that he’s not representing Flynn. DiGenova in an email wrote, “We are not at liberty to discuss.”

Legal experts say the plea deal that Kelner and Anthony cut with Mueller’s team more than a year ago was a generous one, making it possible that Flynn would receive only probation. Trying to back out of the deal now could open Flynn to a variety of charges, including criminal liability related to unregistered lobbying work he did in 2016 on behalf of a foreign client allegedly acting as a front for Turkey.

Flynn’s ex-business partner and the alleged middleman were indicted in the case, but Flynn escaped charges, apparently due to his plea deal. In a joint status report in March, attorneys for Flynn and Mueller told U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan that Flynn could testify in the mid-July trial against his former partner, Bijan Rafiekian.

The Turkey lobbying case is one big reason for the delay in Flynn’s sentencing, which had originally been scheduled for last December but ended up getting postponed after an unexpectedly contentious hearing during which Sullivan repeatedly criticized Flynn, telling him at one point, “Arguably, you sold your country out.”

Sullivan ultimately convinced Flynn to request a delay in his sentencing until he’d done all he could to satisfy the government as part of his cooperation agreement — an offer Flynn has accepted twice.

The next joint status report from Flynn’s legal team and the Justice Department is due June 14. In their letter, Kelner and Anthony noted that Sullivan has the power to deny their motion to withdraw as lawyers if it would slow the trial or harm the integrity of the case, but suggested there was no reason for him to do that.

“As only sentencing remains in this case, sentencing has not yet been scheduled and General Flynn has already retained new counsel, withdrawal at this time would not be prejudicial to any of the parties or otherwise inconsistent with the interests of justice,” the attorneys wrote.

Later Thursday, Sullivan issued a brief one-paragraph order “denying without prejudice” the Flynn lawyers’ motion to withdraw, though it appears the decision centered on a technicality.

Sullivan, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the attorneys didn’t follow a local rule for the court to include the text of a proposed order for him to sign. They also failed “to indicate the manner in which the motion was served upon Mr. Flynn.”

The fired Flynn lawyers responded with a new motion that included the one-page draft order, as well as a notation that they had emailed and hand-delivered a copy of their filing to Flynn at his home address.

Flynn’s legal team turnover comes as some of his family members have used their Twitter feeds in recent days to air complaints about the federal prosecutors’ decision last week not to comply with a judge’s order to publicly file transcripts of intercepted phone calls Flynn conducted with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. The prosecution didn’t indicate precisely why it was rebuffing the judge’s request, but said simply that “it is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence.”

Sullivan issued another order Tuesday saying he would not require further filings on the subject. As of this point, Flynn’s defense has not noted any objection to the prosecution’s failure to provide the transcripts.

Flynn’s decision to shift legal teams is a mistake, said Peter Zeidenberg, a Washington defense attorney and former prosecutor in special counsel Pat Fitzgerald’s CIA-leak probe.

“This is a very foolish thing to do. Flynn’s lawyers had positioned him to get probation for a single count of false statements. Given what he was facing, that is remarkable. It will go downhill from there,” Zeidenberg said.

Flynn “simply cannot do any better than that, under these circumstances,” he added. “If he tries to withdraw his plea, he is going to get pummeled. Unless he has gotten some signals that he may get pardoned — always a possibility — this makes no sense.”","Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn is awaiting sentencing in his case, and the next joint status report from his legal team and the Justice Department is due June 14.

259,Robert Mueller could be subpoenaed in the next two weeks,Andrew Desiderio,"On Wednesday, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told reporters he was “confident” Robert Mueller will appear before his panel, and that he would issue a subpoena “if we have to.” | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Congress Robert Mueller could be subpoenaed in the next two weeks

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told Democratic leaders at a closed-door meeting this week that he could issue a subpoena to Robert Mueller within two weeks if he is unable to reach an agreement to secure the former special counsel’s public testimony, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.

Nadler’s comments at the Tuesday meeting were his clearest remarks to date on the possibility of compelling Mueller’s attendance at a public hearing. The committee is still negotiating with Mueller, who, according to Nadler, is thus far only willing to answer lawmakers’ questions in private — a nonstarter for most House Democrats.

Story Continued Below

The sources cautioned that the committee has not settled on a timetable for a potential subpoena to Mueller. Speaker Nancy Pelosi hosted the meeting, and four other committee chairs were in attendance.

On Wednesday, Nadler told reporters that he was “confident” Mueller will appear before his panel, and that he would issue a subpoena “if we have to.”

“We want him to testify openly. I think the American people need that,” Nadler added. “I think, frankly, it's his duty to the American people. And we'll make that happen.”

Mueller spoke publicly last week for the first time since the start of his 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump sought to obstruct the probe. In addition to formally closing down his investigation and resigning from the Justice Department, Mueller said: “I hope and expect that this is the only time that I will speak to you in this manner.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1298/1155968404_6045433393001_6045428786001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

But he said that if he testifies before Congress, his remarks “will not go beyond our report.”

“The work speaks for itself,” Mueller added. “The report is my testimony.”

Getting Mueller in front of the cameras is House Democrats’ top priority as they seek to spotlight the special counsel’s evidence outlining Trump’s efforts to obstruct the investigation. Democrats are also going to federal court as soon as next week to compel former White House counsel Don McGahn’s testimony, and they have issued subpoenas to other former Trump aides whose testimony Mueller cited in his 448-page report.

Their efforts also come as Pelosi faces pressure to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. During the same meeting Tuesday night, Pelosi stood firm against such proceedings, saying Trump should be “in prison,” not impeached.

But Nadler, who has publicly resisted calls to kick off an impeachment inquiry, made the case to Pelosi for opening one, saying it would strengthen his committee’s standing in federal court as it seeks to haul McGahn and other witnesses before the panel.

Around 60 Democrats have come out in support of impeachment proceedings, and several more have said publicly and privately that Mueller’s testimony will be the deciding factor.

Trump issued a blanket claim of executive privilege over Mueller’s full report and underlying evidence, but Attorney General William Barr has said he does not have an issue with Mueller testifying.

Some Republicans, too, have urged Mueller to testify before Congress, including Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, Nadler’s GOP counterpart.

261,Ocasio-Cortez fights against solitary confinement for Manafort,Pia Deshpande,"Rep. Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez, who has been critical of retributive justice used by the prison system, tweeted that “Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.” | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Ocasio-Cortez fights against solitary confinement for Manafort

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday took up an unlikely cause — the plight of convicted fraudster Paul Manafort.

The progressive lawmaker expressed alarm at reports that President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman would likely be held in isolation after his expected transfer to Rikers Island — the New York City jail complex is in her congressional district — to face additional state fraud charges.

Story Continued Below

“A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That’s what solitary confinement is,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.”

The freshman lawmaker doubled down on her comments when told that Manafort may technically be placed in protective custody. She tweeted that protective custody is a separate method, but “does not necessarily exclude solitary. If he is in fact not being held in solitary, great. Release everyone else from it, too.”

Oscasio-Cortez has been critical of retributive justice used by the prison system. When news broke that Chelsea Manning was being held in solitary confinement for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury, Oscasio-Cortez tweeted that the United States should “ban extended solitary confinement” and that the practice is a form of torture.

Paul Manafort is being sent to solitary confinement in my district - Rikers Island.

Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary. https://t.co/9rERLDSzrD — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 5, 2019

However, Manafort’s possible isolation at Rikers may be partly because of his and his lawyers’ concerns about his safety.

Manafort’s lawyers complained about his confinement from the start after a federal judge ordered him to jail in June 2018 over allegations that he was trying to tamper with the testimony of two potential witnesses in the federal case against him brought by then-special counsel Robert Mueller, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani later lamented that the longtime GOP operative was being nearly “tortured” in his conditions.

But legal experts say that Manafort got special arrangements away from the general prison population because of his high-profile status. At his first jail in Warsaw, Va., Manafort told friends he was being treated like a “VIP” and federal prosecutors explained in court briefs that the GOP operative had a private cell with a bathroom and shower, a personal telephone and access to work space to meet with his lawyers. Manafort’s situation changed in July 2018 when he was moved to Alexandria, Va., in a transfer that his own attorneys had requested to help them be closer to their client as they prepared for his first trial.

Manafort was relocated in April to a minimum-security prison in Waymart, Pa., where he’s serving a 7 ½-year sentence for a series of lobbying, money laundering, financial fraud and witness tampering crimes.

Manafort was also indicted this past March by the Manhattan district attorney as part of an effort to make sure the former Trump ally would still face prison time even if the president pardoned him. The DA wrote in a report following the indictment that Manafort was arrested for a “yearlong residential mortgage fraud scheme” through which Manafort and others “illegally obtained millions of dollars.” His final list of indictments included 16 counts of fraud and one of conspiracy.

Todd Blanche, Manafort’s New York-based lawyer handling the state case, said in an interview he’d make a request to the state judge presiding over the new charges to have his client returned to the Pennsylvania federal facility after his arraignment, rather than have Manafort kept at a city jail.

Blanche said he did not know when that arraignment would take place — he expected about 24-hours notice. He also said he remained in the dark as to whether Manafort would even be brought to Rikers but said he expected state jail supervisors would need to take into account Manafort’s high-profile status when considering whether to put him in a protected area or added to the general population.

“Safety is a big concern,” he told POLITICO.

Manafort’s defense attorneys who worked on his federal case did not respond to a request for comment.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said at a news conference that Manafort will not be given special treatment at Rikers beyond measures needed for security.

265,What will it take to elect more female veterans to Congress?,Zack Stanton,"Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) has firsthand experience with some of the hurdles faced by women in uniform. | Jason Grow for Politico Magazine Women Rule What will it take to elect more female veterans to Congress? Rep. Chrissy Houlahan is the co-founder of a new caucus focused on servicewomen’s needs — one of four female vets in the House drawing on firsthand experiences.

Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Spotify here.

Rep. Chrissy Houlahan remembers the first time she gave a briefing to a general. She was a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, a Stanford graduate who had attended the school on an ROTC scholarship, the daughter and granddaughter of Navy pilots. Her life revolved around service.

Story Continued Below

“My colonel introduced me [to the general] with a blonde joke. And I thought, ‘Hmm, that’s not exactly the way I wanted to start this briefing,’” Houlahan said in an interview for POLITICO’s Women Rule podcast . “I really would have liked to have had the opportunity to just be a lieutenant.”

America’s armed forces have historically been a male-dominated environment. In turn, that means that when military veterans are elected to Congress, they’re generally men.

But that’s beginning to change.

Last November, Chrissy Houlahan was elected to the U.S. House. Even as the number of veterans in Congress is near historic lows for the post-World War II era, the number of women veterans serving in the House of Representatives is at a historic high: four.

The Pennsylvania Democrat knows that might not sound like much — it isn’t. But it’s double the number of women veterans who were in the House just one year ago, and enough that Houlahan and the other three vets — Democratic Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Elaine Luria of Virginia — have officially launched the House Servicewomen and Women Veterans Congressional Caucus.

“There had never been a caucus that was focused exclusively on women who serve,” said Houlahan, despite the fact that roughly one in six active service members are women.

The goal of the caucus is to raise awareness and ensure that the needs of military women are being addressed, according to Houlahan.

“As they’re recruited, you know, what are their particular needs as they come on board active duty, as they go and maybe transition into Reserves status, as they go into their veterans’ part of their career?” she said. “Those are all parts of the arc of a woman who serves.”

Houlahan has firsthand experience with some of the hurdles faced by women in uniform.

“I had my first child when I was active-duty, and the base had a six-month waiting list for childcare, and I had six weeks of leave,” Houlahan recalled. “That was one of the things that precipitated my leaving the military, was that I couldn’t afford childcare outside.”

“The expectation of a traditional military family,” she said, “would be the man would be active-duty, and the woman would be the trailing spouse, and the woman would be responsible for childcare and for transitioning the family from place to place.”

As is happening throughout society, those ideas are changing and old types of behavior are no longer acceptable.

Yet even as progress advances, Houlahan says she sees major barriers that stand in the way of veterans’ winning seats in Congress — especially for women veterans like her.

“It’s hard to be a veteran and to think of yourself in this seat,” she said. “The attack that, naturally, will come at a veteran, is, ‘Well, you don’t live here. You haven’t lived here in a while.’ And that’s really unfortunate. The other reason why I think you see fewer veterans than you should is that, of course, we don’t have enormous networks of people who have resources. … When you’re an early-stage candidate, access to capital is part of the way that you can communicate your message. And we just don’t have the networks that everybody has.”

“I don’t think it’s just women veterans” who have the problem, Houlahan said. ”I think it’s kind of all of us.”

LONDON — Donald Trump is using his U.K. state visit to anoint Brexit winners and losers.

The president on Tuesday fully cast his lot with political leaders pushing for Britain to crash out of the European Union — and in the process trampled on diplomatic norms that foreign leaders generally avoid meddling in domestic politics.

Story Continued Below

Britain is especially fragile at the moment, with Prime Minister Theresa May set to step aside in the coming days, casting doubt on how — or even if — the United Kingdom will leave the EU.

But Trump barreled into the Brexit quagmire on Tuesday. In just a matter of a few hours, he snubbed the leader of the opposition — who wants a close relationship with the EU after Brexit and if he can’t get it, advocates a second referendum on the options — in favor of meeting with two avid Brexiteers and chatting with a third.

Trump “is very interested as to who the next Conservative leader and prime minister is,” said Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, following his own meeting with the president Tuesday.

But it’s not clear Trump’s pressure will win him the nationalist ally he craves in Europe.

For weeks, the discussion about May’s replacement has centered on Boris Johnson, the voluble Brexit leader and former foreign secretary who shares Trump’s penchant for headline-grabbing quotes. On Tuesday, however, it was Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who grabbed the spotlight.

Corbyn had turned down a visit to the lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace the night before saying that the U.S. president did not deserve the honor. Instead, he delivered an anti-Trump screed at a massive rally less than mile away from the president’s joint press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May.

The opposition leader said he would “fight with every last breath” to prevent American companies from carving up the U.K.’s state health system, the National Health Service. And, to cheers from the crowd, he attacked Trump over his policies on immigration, climate change, reproductive rights and international cooperation.

Asked about the comments at the press conference, Trump said Corbyn had asked him to meet, “and I told him no.”

“I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him, never spoke to him,"" Trump added. ""I think that he is ... somewhat of a negative force. I think that people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize.”

The back-and-forth had both sides suddenly contemplating the potential U.S.-U.K. relationship under a Prime Minister Corbyn — a distinct possibility if a general election proves the only way to resolve the U.K.'s political impasse over Brexit.

The U.S. and the U.K. have long proclaimed a “special relationship” exists between the two countries. Trump used the phrase liberally and warmly during his remarks, proclaiming “the greatest alliance the world has ever known.”

But officials and diplomats quietly acknowledge these ties are fraying, strained by Brexit and Trump’s election. Corbyn’s rise to power would almost certainly further test the relationship’s strength still further.

Senior Labour officials war-gaming the prospect of Corbyn as prime minister with Trump still in the White House anticipate a rocky relationship, but not a total breakdown. A diplomatic visit like this week would still take place, one official said, but not with full state honors. Corbyn opposed the granting of a state visit and would continue to do so as prime minister.

“If he were president and Jeremy were prime minister they would find a way of working together. While of course simultaneously being a vocal critic,” the official said.

Whether Corbyn would call the U.S. relationship “special” — a buzzword for post-war U.K. prime ministers — remains to be seen. He used the term in a 2017 conference speech, but did so with conditions. He warned that Trump had “threatened war and talked of tearing up international agreements.”

“If the special relationship means anything, it must mean that we can say to Washington: that way is the wrong way,” Corbyn added at the time.

Some of Labour’s criticisms of Trump — on the Iran nuclear deal, on climate change, on the importance of multilateral bodies like the United Nations — are shared by the Conservative government, and are making the transatlantic relationship more difficult.

Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies predicted the U.S.-U.K. relationship would face ""profound strain"" if Corbyn were to occupy No. 10 Downing. For one, the policies he has espoused over his lengthy political career are ""so dramatically different from what we've come to expect from the United Kingdom,"" she said.

""The more I think through what a Jeremy Corbyn premiership would look like, I think it would almost have some similar aspects to what it looked like when Trump became president,” Conley said. “You would really have a challenge for civil servants who wish to prevent dramatic shifts in policy.”

Corbyn as prime minister would add major new areas of divergence, particularly on military cooperation. Corbyn opposed last year’s airstrikes in Syria, as well as the 2011 Libya intervention. He can be counted on to maintain his lifelong opposition to U.S. foreign interventions if he became prime minister. It is also impossible to imagine Corbyn would be an ally, as May has been, in Trump’s push for NATO allies to spend more on defense.

“I imagine everybody would notice we have a tangible change. We have different policies and different priorities from the current government,” the Labour official said. Then again, the official added: “We could have Bernie.” The left-wing Democrat presidential hopeful would likely be a much more comfortable fit for a Corbyn premiership.

Trump allies have trouble envisioning Corbyn as prime minister, mainly because they don’t believe it will happen. Asked whether Trump would meet Corbyn at the negotiating table if he becomes prime minister, the White House declined to comment. Trump also did not provide a reason for rejecting Corbyn’s meeting request.

The president spent his time Tuesday engaging conservative politicians — one of whom, following the party’s leadership election, will become prime minister.

Trump spoke with Johnson for 20 minutes by phone Tuesday morning. They did not meet in person because of a clash with a leadership hustings among Tory MPs who will select the two nominees to replace May.

Johnson, one of the leaders of the official Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, further bolstered his hardline Brexit credentials when he resigned from May’s Cabinet in protest at her concessions to the EU. The president's team also requested a sit-down meeting with Environment Secretary Michael Gove, another leader of the official Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum.

But with Trump and Corbyn’s public spat on Tuesday, the president’s allies were forced to confront the possibility of a future Corbyn-led Britain.

One ex-Trump aide suggested the Labour leader isn’t particularly popular within his own party after it suffered heavy losses in last month’s European Parliament election. “He’s as well-liked within his party as Hillary Clinton was with Democrats” in 2016, the ex-aide said.

The White House has been careful not to press too hard on issues where May’s successor — whether it’s Johnson, or a handful of other potential candidates — might diverge from Trump, like healthcare and climate change.

Trump was noticeably quiet on the latter issue during his press conference with May. He also didn’t make waves after discussing the topic over tea on Monday with Prince Charles, a major proponent of climate rules and the Paris climate accord.

On trade though, Trump was typically robust. “When you are dealing with trade everything is on the table, so NHS [National Health Service] or anything else… but everything will be on the table, absolutely,” he said.

May quickly pointed out that what was included in a scope of any deal would be the subject of negotiation. But if the U.K. is still in a state of political upheaval and desperate to make up for trade losses with the EU, those talks may prove to be a painfully one-sided affair — special relationship or not.

LONDON — President Donald Trump brought his own royal entourage to Britain.

On his first state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump brought his wife and four adult children, but it wasn’t just family that tagged along for the ride. Close friends such as Chris Ruddy, CEO of the conservative media organization Newsmax, made the trip and attended the state banquet Monday night.

Story Continued Below

The coterie surrounding Trump appeared to provide a buffer throughout the day for the highly anticipated interactions between the unruly American leader and Britain’s well-mannered royal family. The seamless interactions with Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and a host of other British royals stood in contrast with Trump’s pre-arrival Twitter bombast and norm-busting interviews with the British media.

The set up wasn’t an accident. While officials know they can’t stop the Trump tweetstorms — including a heated outburst calling London Mayor Sadiq Khan a “stone cold loser” — they hoped the circle of close friends, family and advisers would at least protect the president’s time with the royals, a former White House official said. First lady Melania Trump reportedly prepared for the trip by studying certain protocols, including walking and speaking directives, to which guests of the queen are meant to adhere in her presence.

“I was glad he defended himself against the London mayor’s attacks, but that’s the kind of stuff you should absolutely leave at the palace door,” the official said.

In addition to Trump’s family and friends, there was also a swollen group of administration officials that accompanied the president. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, social media director Dan Scavino, policy adviser Stephen Miller and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife are in Britain.

But even with the safeguard of advisers and family, Trump has bulldozed his way into England. In a series of interviews ahead of his arrival, Trump called Meghan Markle “nasty,” criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May’s handling of Brexit negotiations and stumped for Boris Johnson, a longtime Brexit champion, to replace the outgoing May.

After touching down, though, a more diplomatic Trump took over.

Trump stood stoically beside Elizabeth on the west terrace of Buckingham Palace to watch the Grenadier Guards, in their iconic red tunics and bearskin hats, give a royal salute. He placed his hand over his heart during a performance of the national anthem, inspected the guard of honor with Charles and dutifully followed her majesty back inside once the ceremony concluded.

By late Monday afternoon, Trump was mostly off Twitter and enjoying a customary cup of tea with Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

“London part of the trip is going really well. The queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong,” Trump wrote on Twitter in between his meetings and the state dinner at Buckingham Palace.

Though White House officials declined to say whether Trump was briefed on royal protocols ahead of the trip, Judi James, a prominent body language expert in the U.K., told the The Daily Telegraph that the president appeared to have studied up since his earlier U.K. trip in July.

“He looked as though he knew what he was doing much more. Last time, there was a degree of awkwardness. This time, he looked much more dignified,” James said.

There are scores of arcane rules for interacting with British royals, said Angela Levin, a royal biographer.

“You never talk to the queen, you wait for her to talk to you first. You don’t go in front of her … and if she stops eating, you have to stop eating too,” she said.

“It’s actually quite daunting for any president, when you’re sitting at the banquet table near the queen and have six glasses in front of you and masses of cutlery,” Levin added, noting that protocol will play an important role when the Trumps accompany the queen on Wednesday to a D-Day anniversary ceremony in Portsmouth.

A senior White House official suggested that Trump’s adult children, who are along for the visit and attended the state banquet with their spouses, didn’t need etiquette lessons before interacting with the queen: “These are kids with impeccable etiquette to start with, so I wondered if that was even necessary.”

Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser, was the only other member of the first family visibly present during the welcome ceremony at Buckingham Palace. She and her husband, White House adviser Jared Kushner, stood on one of several balconies overlooking the queen’s private garden as the president greeted the queen. They were joined by U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Woody Johnson, as national security adviser John Bolton peeked out of a large window to their right. Johnson is set to host a reception for the president, U.K. officials and members of the royal family at his residence Tuesday night.

Aides are more anxious about Tuesday's joint news conference by Trump and May, according to an administration official. It’s these bilateral events, rather than the ceremonial gatherings, at which Trump tends to make news. Indeed, Trump has repeatedly sparked controversy during overseas news conferences.

The president sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin when he claimed during a joint appearance last summer that Kremlin operatives did not meddle in the 2016 presidential election. And at a news conference last month with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump said he agreed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s criticism of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Trump will also have a three-hour gap on Tuesday between his final bilateral event and his dinner at the ambassador’s home — a rest period that is likely to put White House aides and U.K. officials on edge.

On Monday, once his activities with members of the royal household had concluded, Trump fired off four tweets on a wide range of topics in a two-hour span of downtime.

“Haven’t seen any protests yet, but I’m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them… Also, big Trade Deal is possible once U.K. gets rid of the shackles. Already starting to talk!” he wrote.

LONDON — Donald Trump the flatterer made another appearance on Tuesday.

At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, the president paid the outgoing leader his top compliment, calling her “probably a better negotiator than I am.” And he didn’t stop there, telling May she deserves “a lot of credit” for her handling of Brexit, even if her resignation later this week paves the way for an exit deal with the European Union.

“You know, she has got it — that deal is teed up,” Trump said as he turned toward May. “And perhaps you won’t be given the credit you deserve when they do something, but I think you deserve a lot of credit. I really do.”

The remark stood out given Trump’s criticism only days earlier about May's handling of Brexit, not to mention his attempts to court May’s possible successors. Trump made only a glancing remark about his past Brexit commentary. “I would have sued and settled, maybe,” Trump quipped, referring to the advice he’s previously chided May for ignoring. But it was the second day in a row Trump was largely on diplomatic behavior — he spent Monday in mostly smooth ceremonial events with the British royal family.

In fact, Trump had praise to go around on Tuesday.

On Boris Johnson, the conservative politician seen as a leading candidate to take over as prime minister, Trump said, “I like him, I’ve liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job.”

On Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, who greeted the president on the tarmac when he arrived in London on Monday and has criticized British lawmakers for boycotting Trump, the president said, “I think he’d do a very good job,” before seeking May’s input. “Would Jeremy do a good job?”

Trump even saved his barbed commentary for one of May’s biggest political opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who the president labeled “somewhat of a negative force.”

Just minutes earlier, Corbyn had spoken at a massive rally protesting Trump’s visit in nearby Trafalgar Square.

“He wanted to meet with me, and I told him no,” the president said of Corbyn. “Well, I don’t know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him, never spoke to him, “ he continued. “I think that people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1614/1155968404_6044472309001_6044470694001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

Corbyn on Monday boycotted a state banquet attended by other members of Parliament, saying he was ""disappointed"" by Trump's tweets about London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The president had called Khan a ""stone cold loser"" and said he reminded him of ""very dumb and incompetent"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat running for president. Corbyn himself is vying to succeed May as prime minister and has been critical of Trump’s policies on trade, immigration and climate change.

Though Trump faces no requirements to meet with opposition leaders like Corbyn, he is expected to sit down with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and possibly hold one-on-one talks with Michael Gove, another Conservative Party politician and contender for prime minister. Trump also spoke with Johnson, currently the front-runner to succeed May, in a 30-minute call Tuesday morning.

By comparison, former President Barack Obama met with then-Labour leader Ed Miliband, the top opposition politician at the time, during his visit to Washington in 2011. The circumstances were slightly different, though, as Miliband was largely supportive of Obama’s administration.

Corbyn tweeted Monday that Trump's state visit was a chance to ""stand in solidarity with those he's attacked in America."" But in subsequent remarks to anti-Trump demonstrators, Corbyn said he had nevertheless hoped to have a “conversation” with the U.S. leader.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1538/1155968404_6044459649001_6044456236001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

“I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in,” Corbyn said.

Asked about the protests on Tuesday, which took place just around the corner from the location of the news conference, Trump said he hadn't noticed them and described such coverage as “fake news.”

""We left the prime minister, the queen, the royal family, there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering,"" Trump said. ""And then I heard that there were protests. I said, 'Where are the protests? I don't see any protests.'""

Trump swiped at Khan as well, saying he is ""not a very good mayor"" and ""has done a poor job.”

""I don't think he should be criticizing a representative of the United States that can do so much good for the United Kingdom,"" Trump said. ""He should be positive, not negative. He is a negative force, not a positive force.""","poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/2254/1155968404_6044400923001_6044388102001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true Foreign Policy Trump flatters in final press conference with U.K.’s May The remarks stood out given Trump’s criticism only days earlier about May's handling Brexit, not to mention his attempts to court May’s possible successors.

“As one officer said,” war correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote shortly after the invasion, “the only way to take a beach is to face it and keep going.

270,Ad attacking EU presidential candidates beats Big Tech,Lili Bayer,"A mysterious online campaign against leading European Commission presidential candidates has featured in Google and Facebook ads despite breaching both companies' rules on political advertising.

The campaign uses online advertisements to target Manfred Weber, the German candidate of Europe's main center-right political alliance, and Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans, his Dutch center-left rival. The ads link to two articles hosted on the Medium online publishing platform that criticize both men, posted under what appears to be a fake profile.

People in Brussels saw the ads in recent days on websites that host advertising provided by Google's powerful Ads platform, including POLITICO's European edition. The ads — featuring photos of the two lead candidates and the banner ""Welcome Timmermans and Timmermans 2.0!"" — appeared to be specifically targeted at internet users in Belgium.

The ads are directly relevant to a small but influential audience, as the decision on the next Commission president will be taken by the leaders of the EU's member countries and the European Parliament. However, they do not seem to have been written by a native English speaker.

Falling through the cracks

The ads raise fresh questions about the effectiveness of measures by Google, Facebook and other tech companies to tackle disinformation on their platforms. The companies have pledged to make sure political ads are identified as such and to disclose who is behind them, but failed on both counts with the campaign attacking Weber and Timmermans.

Following questions from POLITICO, Google blocked the ads and said it is looking into the case. The company declined to answer questions about who was behind the ads, how much was paid to run them, how many people they reached and which users they targeted. Facebook had not responded to POLITICO's questions by the time of this article's publication, and the ads were still active and unmarked as ""political.""

Google, Facebook and Twitter signed up to an EU code of practice on disinformation last year, pledging to boost transparency around political campaigning on their platforms. In the run-up to last month's European Parliament election, they also released transparency tools for political ads, meant to alert users when they are reading political material, and promised to take down coordinated efforts to mislead or provide false information to European voters.

But the ads driving users to the articles criticizing Timmermans and Weber apparently fell through the cracks because the people responsible didn't declare them as political.

Fake author profile?

The post on Medium featured in the Google ads argues that there is little difference between Timmermans, candidate of the Party of European Socialists, and Weber, leader of the European People's Party group in the European Parliament.

""Why do we have the feeling that Mr Weber speaks only to the Western, politically correct, liberal citizens of the EU?"" the article states.

The author is listed as Marta Loeb, described in her Medium profile as ""associate professor of modern sociology, reporter and editor-in-chief of Who Is Who."" POLITICO has been unable to identify any real person with this name and background.

The European Commission is currently reviewing the effectiveness of the voluntary regime that nudged the platforms into taking action.

The profile only became active in the past two weeks, along with a matching Facebook page that ran three paid ads promoting Medium articles ostensibly posted by the same person, according to data from the social media platform's ad library.

On June 3, the Facebook page launched a paid ad that appears to link to an article about ""how a song used in 'The Exorcist' helped make [Richard] Branson millions."" Instead, users are directed to another article, ostensibly by Marta Loeb, arguing that ""Frans Timmermans is authentic as a thinker representing left-wing ideas, but not credible as a politician.""

Although both Medium-hosted articles on the EU's lead candidates are in English, they contain grammatical mistakes and wording that would be highly unusual for native speakers.

On May 23, the Facebook page ran links to the Medium page of ""Marta Loeb,"" featuring two plagiarized articles, one a copy of a piece on the inventor of Bitcoin originally published in the Sun, and the other an article on Bill Gates. Both articles were promoted with paid Facebook ads to boost their visibility.

On the same date, another post appeared on the Facebook page titled ""Who's Who,"" directing users to the article on Timmermans and Weber. Despite not being a promoted ad, the post got 340 likes on Facebook, many of which came from accounts of users listed as living in Brussels.

An almost identical Facebook post appeared the following day linking to the article on Timmermans and Weber. And while also not being promoted as an ad, the post got 67 likes, many of which apparently came from users in Hungary.

The company said it couldn't provide more details about the ads.

Google said the company is investigating the ads that ran on its platform.

“Our EU election ads policy requires advertisers that want to run EU Parliamentary election ads to be verified. In addition, we require these ads to display an in-ad disclaimer of who paid for them.

271,Ad attacking EU presidential candidates beats Big Tech,Laurens Cerulus,"A mysterious online campaign against leading European Commission presidential candidates has featured in Google and Facebook ads despite breaching both companies' rules on political advertising.

The campaign uses online advertisements to target Manfred Weber, the German candidate of Europe's main center-right political alliance, and Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans, his Dutch center-left rival. The ads link to two articles hosted on the Medium online publishing platform that criticize both men, posted under what appears to be a fake profile.

People in Brussels saw the ads in recent days on websites that host advertising provided by Google's powerful Ads platform, including POLITICO's European edition. The ads — featuring photos of the two lead candidates and the banner ""Welcome Timmermans and Timmermans 2.0!"" — appeared to be specifically targeted at internet users in Belgium.

The ads are directly relevant to a small but influential audience, as the decision on the next Commission president will be taken by the leaders of the EU's member countries and the European Parliament. However, they do not seem to have been written by a native English speaker.

Falling through the cracks

The ads raise fresh questions about the effectiveness of measures by Google, Facebook and other tech companies to tackle disinformation on their platforms. The companies have pledged to make sure political ads are identified as such and to disclose who is behind them, but failed on both counts with the campaign attacking Weber and Timmermans.

Following questions from POLITICO, Google blocked the ads and said it is looking into the case. The company declined to answer questions about who was behind the ads, how much was paid to run them, how many people they reached and which users they targeted. Facebook had not responded to POLITICO's questions by the time of this article's publication, and the ads were still active and unmarked as ""political.""

Google, Facebook and Twitter signed up to an EU code of practice on disinformation last year, pledging to boost transparency around political campaigning on their platforms. In the run-up to last month's European Parliament election, they also released transparency tools for political ads, meant to alert users when they are reading political material, and promised to take down coordinated efforts to mislead or provide false information to European voters.

But the ads driving users to the articles criticizing Timmermans and Weber apparently fell through the cracks because the people responsible didn't declare them as political.

Fake author profile?

The post on Medium featured in the Google ads argues that there is little difference between Timmermans, candidate of the Party of European Socialists, and Weber, leader of the European People's Party group in the European Parliament.

""Why do we have the feeling that Mr Weber speaks only to the Western, politically correct, liberal citizens of the EU?"" the article states.

The author is listed as Marta Loeb, described in her Medium profile as ""associate professor of modern sociology, reporter and editor-in-chief of Who Is Who."" POLITICO has been unable to identify any real person with this name and background.

The European Commission is currently reviewing the effectiveness of the voluntary regime that nudged the platforms into taking action.

The profile only became active in the past two weeks, along with a matching Facebook page that ran three paid ads promoting Medium articles ostensibly posted by the same person, according to data from the social media platform's ad library.

On June 3, the Facebook page launched a paid ad that appears to link to an article about ""how a song used in 'The Exorcist' helped make [Richard] Branson millions."" Instead, users are directed to another article, ostensibly by Marta Loeb, arguing that ""Frans Timmermans is authentic as a thinker representing left-wing ideas, but not credible as a politician.""

Although both Medium-hosted articles on the EU's lead candidates are in English, they contain grammatical mistakes and wording that would be highly unusual for native speakers.

On May 23, the Facebook page ran links to the Medium page of ""Marta Loeb,"" featuring two plagiarized articles, one a copy of a piece on the inventor of Bitcoin originally published in the Sun, and the other an article on Bill Gates. Both articles were promoted with paid Facebook ads to boost their visibility.

On the same date, another post appeared on the Facebook page titled ""Who's Who,"" directing users to the article on Timmermans and Weber. Despite not being a promoted ad, the post got 340 likes on Facebook, many of which came from accounts of users listed as living in Brussels.

An almost identical Facebook post appeared the following day linking to the article on Timmermans and Weber. And while also not being promoted as an ad, the post got 67 likes, many of which apparently came from users in Hungary.

The company said it couldn't provide more details about the ads.

YouTube on Wednesday said it's banning videos promoting white supremacy, Nazism and other bigotry-boosting ideologies, as well as those denying that violent events like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary took place.

The ban expands on existing anti-hate speech rules ""by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status,"" the Google subsidiary said in a blog post.

Story Continued Below

The ban will result in the deletion of thousands of videos already online, a spokesperson said.

""It’s our responsibility to ... prevent our platform from being used to incite hatred, harassment, discrimination and violence,"" the blog post reads. ""We are committed to taking the steps needed to live up to this responsibility today, tomorrow and in the years to come.""

YouTube is also bolstering previously announced changes to its video recommendations, seeking to direct users to fewer ""borderline"" videos that spread offensive speech or hoaxes without technically breaking any rules. The company hopes to bring those currently U.S.-exclusive changes to other countries by year's end, it said.

Channels that repeatedly post borderline videos will also be blocked from running ads or otherwise monetizing their content, YouTube added.

The move comes as YouTube and fellow tech giants like Facebook and Twitter face blowback in Washington and around the country for stumbling in efforts to stop the spread of hate speech. The companies spent years, for instance, dithering on whether far-right provocateur and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was breaking their rules by doing things like directing his followers to attack the parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting. Facebook ultimatelybanned Jones for good last month as part of a broader crackdown on hate speech following a series of suspensions and deletions of Jones-affiliated pages.

Yet such moves have only drawn internet platforms further into thorny political fights over their role as modern public squares. Democrats are often outraged by their perceived inaction against incitements to hate, while Republicans hammer the companies for what they say is a chilling effect their content moderation decisions have on free speech.

""Am no fan of Jones,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tweeted following an earlier Jones suspension last year, ""but who the hell made Facebook the arbiter of political speech?""

In the last week alone, YouTube has been at the center of two high-profile controversies over what critics say have been failures to address potentially dangerous content.

Vox journalist Carlos Maza went viral last week with a Twitter thread chronicling a longstanding pattern of conservative humorist Steven Crowder posting YouTube videos mocking Maza with homophobic and anti-Hispanic slurs. YouTube on Tuesday said it won't take action against Crowder because his videos, though containing ""language that was clearly hurtful,"" didn't overtly break any rules.

Meanwhile, the New York Times on Monday reported that despite past efforts by the company to keep pedophiles off YouTube, some videos of semi-clothed children are getting up to hundreds of thousands of views, exacerbated by getting swept up into YouTube's video recommendation engine. The company said in a subsequent blog post that it's begun downplaying such videos' visibility but won't stop recommending them altogether.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) in a Tuesday tweet linking to the Times story, which he called ""sickening,"" illustrated the political pressure that YouTube and other tech giants are under to improve their oversight of what happens on their platforms.

""Algorithms are amoral and platforms need human supervision,"" he said. ""If they aren’t concerned about commercial or moral consequence, they should at least be worried about angering policymakers.""

Jared Kushner’s Middle East peace plan isn’t even out yet, but there are already intensifying calls to scrap the rollout — including from some Trump allies.

Prominent conservative and pro-Israel voices close to the White House are increasingly sharing their fears, which range from the possibility that the peace proposal could trigger violence to worries that its offerings could forever kill efforts to craft a two-state solution. Many hoped the plan would get shelved even before the latest political turmoil in Israel prompted the scheduling of new elections in the fall. Now, some are going on the record to urge the Trump administration to set aside the plan indefinitely, even though few people have seen the closely held proposal.

Story Continued Below

“Releasing the plan now would make the U.S. seem unserious,” James Carafano, a senior foreign affairs scholar with the conservative Heritage Foundation who usually sides with the administration, said in an email. “It’s better to wait, perhaps even until after the U.S. elections.”

Trump himself conceded Sunday that Kushner’s proposal might not be workable, agreeing with an unvarnished private assessment Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave in a meeting last week that was recorded and leaked to The Washington Post.

If those assessments weren’t enough to doom the proposal, the deep skepticism from Middle East specialists from across the political spectrum would rob Kushner of powerful surrogates who could help sell it both domestically and abroad.

Among the most prominent Middle East observers urging Kushner to kill the proposal is Rob Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank that views the U.S.-Israel relationship as a strategic asset to American interests in the Middle East.

In op-eds, Satloff, who describes himself as a nonpartisan independent, has warned of a negative chain reaction that could follow the plan’s release. For instance, if Palestinians reject the plan, Israelis on the right could pressure their government to go ahead and annex parts of the West Bank. Such a move, he said, would further isolate Israel on the world stage and effectively weaken its ability to counter Iran.

“Issuing the Middle East peace plan in the current environment is a lose-lose-lose proposition,” Satloff wrote April 10 in Foreign Policy.

“For now, Rob is right — they definitely shouldn’t release it now,” said a Middle East analyst at a conservative think tank, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

“This plan is doomed,” added Ilan Goldenberg of the Center for a New American Security, who worked on Israeli-Palestinian issues while serving in the Democratic Obama administration.

For their part, Kushner and other aides to Trump appear intent on going full speed ahead.

Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law, is expected to unveil an economic component of the peace proposal at a conference later this month in Bahrain. The Trump administration is hoping to bring investment to the Palestinian territories as part of a broader agreement between the two sides. A number of leading Arab countries, as well as Israel, plan to attend the conference, set for June 25-26. The Palestinians, however, are boycotting.

“We look forward to presenting our ambitious and exciting economic vision in Bahrain,” an administration official told POLITICO.

White House officials have said they will release the political aspects of the plan — covering major topics such as whether Palestinian refugees will be allowed to return to Gaza, the West Bank and perhaps other disputed territories — at an unspecified later date. Kushner has already indicated the proposal will not include the phrase “two-state solution,” suggesting the Palestinians will not be offered their own country.

Few details of the peace proposal have been released to anyone outside the White House, let alone the public. But the Trump administration’s actions thus far have convinced Palestinian leaders that the plan will not offer much of interest for them.

Already, the Trump administration has cut financial aid to the Palestinians, shut their offices in Washington and recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital — a rebuke to the Palestinians, who claim parts of Jerusalem as their future capital. Trump officials also have remained silent about longtime Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hints that he may move to annex parts or all of the West Bank.

These moves have also raised unease among America’s Arab allies, who, despite their desire to maintain good ties to the Trump team, fear alienating their own populations if they turn their back on the majority Muslim Palestinians.

“A diplomatic initiative this ham-handed, in a context where the U.S. administration has gone out of its way to alienate and pressure one side while aligning its own political fortunes with the other, and in which regional governments whose support for peace is crucial are asking real questions about American credibility — well, that’s destined for failure,” said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a Middle East analyst with the Brookings Institution.

Should Kushner reveal even the economic piece of the plan later this month, it could affect the electoral prospects of Netanyahu, a close Trump ally who has cheered many of his seemingly anti-Palestinian moves.

Kushner had originally held off on unveiling the plan until after Israel’s April 9 elections, counting on Netanyahu’s party to win the election. Netanyahu emerged victorious, but he was unable to form a governing coalition in the required time frame, spurring the need for a new election.

The Trump administration has already had to repeatedly delay the proposal’s release, a fact Pompeo acknowledged in his private remarks last week, saying the process “has taken us longer … than I had originally thought it might — to put it lightly.”

And putting off the release until after the new Israeli election comes with the risk could run into the U.S. election calendar as the 2020 race for the White House heats up. As a result, officials may wager they have little to lose by at least offering up the economic portion of the proposal.

Some Middle East specialists say Kushner should release the plan by the fall. At the very least, it could serve as an “aspirational” document that future negotiators could plumb for ideas.

“The administration issuing their plan … should have value as setting down a guidepost for when the environment for a deal is more suitable,” said Michael Makovsky, the president of the right-leaning Jewish Institute for National Security of America.

Some added that by dragging it out too long, the administration is risking embarrassment.

“It’s hard for me to imagine this administration, with all of the anticipation leading up to this, not releasing the plan,” said Jonathan Schanzer, a senior vice president for research at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It’s too hard for them to walk back.”

But others say no plan is better than one destined for defeat.

Aaron David Miller, who has worked on Israeli-Palestinian issues for both Republican and Democratic presidents, noted that President Bill Clinton told him that trying and failing was better not trying at all in the run up the 2000 Camp David summit. But those talks ended without an agreement, and the Israeli-Palestinian relationship still hasn’t fully recovered, Miller said.

“Failure, particularly repeated failure, costs and can make matters much worse,” he said. “Kushner should take a deep breath, lie down and wait quietly until the rush to put the ultimate deal on table passes. Go back to drawing board and make sure what you’re proposing is equitable, durable and in the end advances, not crushes, U.S. credibility.”","Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner has been working on a peace deal in the Middle East for two years.

279,"Sanders crashes Walmart meeting, blasts 'starvation wages'",Nolan D. Mccaskill,"At Walmart's annual shareholders meeting in Arkansas, Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced a proposal to allow hourly employees to join the company’s board. | Jeff Chiu, File/AP Photo 2020 elections Sanders crashes Walmart meeting, blasts 'starvation wages'

Bernie Sanders showed up to a Walmart shareholders meeting Wednesday and blasted what he called the retail giant’s “starvation wages” and imploring it to pay people at least $15 an hour.

The Vermont senator briefly addressed Walmart leadership at its annual shareholders meeting in Bentonville, Ark. Sanders introduced a proposal to allow hourly employees to join the company’s board but used the remainder of his allotted three minutes to push for a “living” minimum wage.

Story Continued Below

“The issue that we are dealing with today is pretty simple,” Sanders said. “Walmart is the largest private employer in America and is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in the United States, worth approximately $175 billion. And yet despite the incredible wealth of its owner, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages, wages that are so low that many of these employees are forced to rely on government programs like food stamps, Medicaid and public housing in order to survive.”

“Frankly,” Sanders continued, “the American people are sick and tired of subsidizing the greed of some of the largest and most profitable corporations in this country.”

Sanders was invited to speak as a proxy for Walmart worker Cat Davis, a leader of the pro-worker group United for Respect. It was Davis’ proposal that Sanders pitched.

Sanders called out Walmart’s CEO for the “grotesque level of income and wealth inequality,” noting that Doug McMillon makes 1,000 times more than the average Walmart employee. Sanders said the company had a profit last year of nearly $10 billion, paid McMillon more than $20 million in compensation and authorized $20 billion in stock buybacks to benefit its wealthiest stockholders.

“Surely, with all of that, Walmart can afford to pay its employees a living wage of at least $15 an hour,” Sanders said. “And that is not a radical idea, because many of Walmart’s major competitors like Amazon, Costco and Target have already moved in that direction.”

Sanders received a tepid applause in the room. A campaign aide said three of his staffers weren’t allowed in, and Rachel Brand, Walmart’s executive vice president of global governance, chief legal officer and corporate secretary, swiftly dismissed the proposal.

“Thank you, Sen. Sanders, for your presentation and your viewpoint,” Brand said. “While we don’t support this particular proposal, the importance of listening to and investing in our associates was reflected in Doug’s remarks and you’ll hear more about it later in the meeting.”

McMillon, for his part, credited Walmart earlier in the meeting for investing in higher wages for its employees but acknowledged that the federal minimum wage is too low. He put the onus on Congress, however, “to put a thoughtful plan in place to increase the minimum wage.”

In his closing remarks, Greg Penner, chairman of the board, indirectly hit back at Sanders’ criticism, praising Walmart as a company that cares about its customers and its workers. The meeting ended with a nearly two-minute-long promotional video.

Sanders, however, took his criticism outside. At an impromptu rally outside Walmart headquarters, the Democratic presidential candidate stressed that Walmart’s minimum wage isn’t enough.

“People cannot make it on $11 an hour,” he said. “You can’t pay rent. You can’t get health care. You can’t feed your kids or put gas in the car on $11 an hour.”

Sanders’ next stop is McDonald’s. His campaign announced that he will join workers pushing for a $15 minimum wage and a union in Cedar Rapids on Sunday, then lead a march to the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame Celebration.

280,Flynn’s Turkish lobbying client complained about Trump’s stance during campaign,Eliana Johnson,"The memo was obtained during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and has now become part of the criminal case against former Michael Flynn business partner Bijan Rafiekian. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images legal Flynn’s Turkish lobbying client complained about Trump’s stance during campaign

A foreign client paying retired Gen. Michael Flynn more than $500,000 to mount a campaign to advance Turkish government interests during the 2016 presidential campaign explicitly complained to a Flynn aide that then-candidate Donald Trump was not being supportive enough, newly released documents show.

A set of talking points prepared in October 2016 by Mike Boston, a former U.S. intelligence officer working with Flynn, indicate that “the client” backing the lobbying project complained that the GOP nominee had not gone to bat for Turkey. At the time, Flynn was also serving as a top foreign policy adviser to Trump.

Story Continued Below

“Republican Presidential candidate has not defended subject’s home country publicly. He should specifically ask questions about subject’s operations and funding,” Boston wrote under the heading “CLIENT FEEDBACK.”

The memo was obtained during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and has now become part of the criminal case against former Flynn business partner Bijan Rafiekian, who was indicted last December for acting as an unregistered agent for Turkey in the U.S. and a related conspiracy charge.

Rafiekian, also known simply as Kian, has pleaded not guilty and is set to go on trial in July in federal court in Alexandria, Va.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201712/731/1155968404_5664522436001_5664485776001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

The talking points prepared for Flynn less than a month before the 2016 presidential election track with other, handwritten notes Mueller obtained that indicate the critique was offered by Ekim Alptekin, the Turkish businessman who hired Flynn’s Flynn Intelligence Group to try to change attitudes in the U.S. about Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish dissident cleric who has lived for decades in Pennsylvania.

“Trump didn’t defend Turkey publically,” the notes say. “Potentially ask questions about $.”

Boston’s memo also makes another mention of the need to boost Turkey’s political clout with the incoming president.

“Start a strategic outreach campaign for the next President ... regardless of party,” he wrote, describing a discussion with Alptekin on Oct. 7, 2016.

Alptekin was also charged in the indictment filed against Rafiekian last December by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Alexandria. The indictment charges that both men were on the call Boston summarized.

Flynn was not charged in the indictment, but when he pleaded guilty in 2017 to a single felony count of making false statements to the FBI, he also admitted to providing inaccurate information to the Justice Department about his work related to Turkey.

An email accompanying the talking points says they were intended to be shared with Flynn, but it’s not clear that they were.

Flynn is expected to be a key witness against Kian at his trial. Alptekin remains at large and is not expected to appear at the upcoming trial.

Defense lawyers for Kian have indicated plans to aggressively challenge Flynn’s credibility, pointing to what they say are numerous lies by the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief who served for 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for allegedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence.

The newly disclosed documents could provide further fodder to attack Flynn as someone who was seeking to profit off his connection to the Trump campaign.

Attorneys for Flynn and for Kian did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

The memos indicate that part of the work done through the project included investigating alleged financial ties between Gulen’s schools and supporters and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Those points made it into an op-ed piece Flynn published on the day of the 2016 election. The article included a video of President Bill Clinton calling Gulen a “friend” and noting that a foundation backing pro-Gulen charter schools in the U.S. has also made donations to the Clinton Foundation.

Flynn’s team also boasted of getting the anti-Gulen message out in the media, including having a negative Los Angeles Times story about some of the charter schools cited in the “syllabus” section of an October 2016 edition of POLITICO’s Morning Education newsletter.

The documents were filed publicly on Thursday as part of a motion by prosecutors to get the judge in the case to allow them to present evidence of Kian’s discussions with attorneys about the lobbying efforts. Flynn Intelligence Group filed reports under the Lobbying Disclosure Act about the work, but made no mention that Turkish government officials had played any part in the project. In March 2017, FIG filed a belated Foreign Agents Registration Act disclosure providing more details about the engagement and saying it may have benefited Turkish interests.

The Turkish government blamed Gulen for a coup attempt in July 2016 and sought his extradition from the U.S., a request that was denied. Gulen has denied involvement in the unrest.

The newly disclosed documents could provide further fodder to attack Flynn as someone who was seeking to profit off his connection to the Trump campaign.

Attorneys for Flynn and for Kian did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

The memos indicate that part of the work done through the project included investigating alleged financial ties between Gulen’s schools and supporters and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Those points made it into an op-ed piece Flynn published on the day of the 2016 election. The article included a video of President Bill Clinton calling Gulen a “friend” and noting that a foundation backing pro-Gulen charter schools in the U.S. has also made donations to the Clinton Foundation.

Flynn’s team also boasted of getting the anti-Gulen message out in the media, including having a negative Los Angeles Times story about some of the charter schools cited in the “syllabus” section of an October 2016 edition of POLITICO’s Morning Education newsletter.

The documents were filed publicly on Thursday as part of a motion by prosecutors to get the judge in the case to allow them to present evidence of Kian’s discussions with attorneys about the lobbying efforts. Flynn Intelligence Group filed reports under the Lobbying Disclosure Act about the work, but made no mention that Turkish government officials had played any part in the project. In March 2017, FIG filed a belated Foreign Agents Registration Act disclosure providing more details about the engagement and saying it may have benefited Turkish interests.

The Turkish government blamed Gulen for a coup attempt in July 2016 and sought his extradition from the U.S., a request that was denied. Gulen has denied involvement in the unrest.

282,‘No loyalty or allegiance to America’: Warren targets multinationals in economic platform,Alex Thompson,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plan to help American workers with a focus on reining in corporate greed. | Jeff Chiu/AP Photo 2020 elections ‘No loyalty or allegiance to America’: Warren targets multinationals in economic platform

Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a new “Green Manufacturing Plan” on Tuesday as part of a broader “economic patriotism” platform that the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate will roll out in the weeks ahead.

That platform will focus on more aggressively protecting American workers on issues like trade, currency manipulation and the moving of jobs overseas by multinational corporations, Warren wrote in a Medium post. She argued that blaming forces like globalization and automation for stagnant wages and growing inequality were “excuses” that failed to identify those she sees as the real culprits: a greedy corporate America and a corrupt political system.

Story Continued Below

“Sure, these companies wave the flag — but they have no loyalty or allegiance to America,” Warren wrote. “These ‘American’ companies show only one real loyalty: to the short-term interests of their shareholders, a third of whom are foreign investors.”

Warren named names — calling out Levi’s, Dixon Ticonderoga (manufacturer of the distinctive No. 2 pencil) and General Electric for moving factories outside the United States.

“The truth is that Washington policies — not unstoppable market forces — are a key driver of the problems American workers face,” Warren wrote. “From our trade agreements to our tax code, we have encouraged companies to invest abroad, ship jobs overseas, and keep wages low.”

Warren announced the platform, along with her green manufacturing plan, ahead of appearances in Michigan and Indiana on Tuesday and Wednesday — states that have been particularly affected by de-industrialization.

The “economic patriotism” framework will continue to be filled in over the coming weeks, but Warren laid out a few concrete actions. Those steps include “more actively managing [U.S.] currency value to promote exports and domestic manufacturing,” tapping the Export-Import Bank to match what countries like China and Germany have done to finance exports, and consolidating myriad economic programs and agencies into a new Department of Economic Development, which will also envelop the Department of Commerce.

To manage currency value, a Warren aide said, there are a number of tools available, including potentially labeling other countries as “currency manipulators” — something the United States hasn’t done in two decades. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to classify China in such a way, but his Treasury Department has not yet done so.

While Warren’s call for agency consolidation and a new department has similarities to an Obama administration proposal from 2012, much of her policy framework is the latest sign that she will chart a markedly different path forward on issues like trade and globalization than recent Democratic presidents. Bill Clinton signed NAFTA and pushed to allow China into the World Trade Organization. Barack Obama lobbied hard to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, as Warren campaigned ferociously against it, arguing at the time that it was merely “letting giant corporations rig the rules.”

“[G]lobalization isn’t some mysterious force whose effects are inevitable and beyond our control,” Warren wrote in her Medium post. “No — America chose to pursue a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers.”

It is also another example of the quickly changing politics in both parties surrounding free trade and globalization. Warren’s aggressive words for corporate America and calls for a sort of economic nationalism echo some of Trump’s “America First” rhetoric on the campaign trail in 2016. Instead of targeting the makers of jeans, Trump took aim at Nabisco for moving a factory to Mexico and pledged to stop eating Oreos in protest.

Warren has argued that Trump’s populist rhetoric did not translate into action — that his administration appointed industry insiders rather than reformers, and that his signature tax-cut package increased profits of the companies he was lambasting for moving operations overseas. She also came out firmly against Trump’s renegotiated trade deal with Mexico and Canada, dubbing it “NAFTA 2.0” in a speech last November.

But Warren has also agreed with some broader Trump goals like taking on China’s trade practices, instead criticizing the way he’s gone about it, particularly his use of Twitter. Besides the string of tariffs, the administration has also made some moves that are out of line with traditional conservative views on free trade. Late last month, the Commerce Department proposed imposing additional duties on foreign goods when the other country’s currency is deemed “undervalued.”

It’s still unclear how Warren’s “economic patriotism” will play in the 2020 Democratic primary. Her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders found success in campaigning against the TPP during his 2016 presidential campaign. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton abandoned the deal as well, despite having helped negotiate it and calling it the “gold standard.”

But other Democratic candidates may point to the pain inflicted by Trump’s tariffs as a reason to not veer far from recent Democratic administrations. Former Vice President Joe Biden — who some progressives think is vulnerable because of his past support for NAFTA and TPP — has tried to strike a more balanced tone. He has defended his NAFTA vote and criticized the Trump administration’s tariffs, and his campaign has promised that a “progressive trade policy” will be coming.

Warren and Sanders both may continue to try to play up that contrast with Biden, especially given his front-runner status and large lead in national polls.

“It’s not a question of more government or less government,” Warren wrote. “It’s about who government works for.”

286,How Elizabeth Warren would create a clean energy economy,Eric Wolff,"Elizabeth Warren‘s three-part plan would use the federal procurement process to spread clean energy technologies and improve the lives of workers to advance clean energy. | Miikka Skaffari/Getty Images for MoveOn Democratic Candidates Policies How Elizabeth Warren would create a clean energy economy

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) aims to turn the United States into a clean energy manufacturing powerhouse. This is Warren‘s second climate proposal, the first would require the military to make its non-combat bases go net-zero emissions by 2030.



What would the plan do?



Warren‘s three-part plan would use the federal procurement process to spread clean energy technologies and improve the lives of workers to advance clean energy, pump billions into research and development, and create an office designed to sell U.S. clean energy products around the world.



How would it work?

Story Continued Below



Warren would spend $1.5 trillion over 10 years in direct federal spending on clean energy technology in an effort to stimulate demand for American-made, zero-emission products. The program, called the “Green Industrial Mobilization”, dovetails with the economic goals of the Green New Deal by mandating that companies with federal contracts pay employees no less than $15 an hour, provide 12 weeks of paid family leave, and guarantee collective bargaining rights.

She would also pump in $400 billion over 10 years on clean energy research and development, creating a National Institutes of Clean Energy, modeled on the National Institutes for Health. New products developed in this program would then be made in the U.S.A.

And finally she would commit $100 billion to help other countries purchase the new products developed and produced in the U.S.



How much would it cost?





$2 trillion

How would she pay for it?



That hefty price tag will be funded partly through her plan to tax corporations based on the net income reported to share holders, along with ending oil and gas fuel subsidies and closing some corporate tax loopholes.



What have other Democrats proposed?

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee proposes spending $3 trillion in federal money over 10 years to leverage an additional $6 trillion in investment.

Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke unveiled his vision for the government and private sector to spend $5 trillion over 10 years on clean energy infrastructure.

Former Vice President Joe Biden proposed spending $1.7 trillion over 10 years to leverage $5 trillion in private, state, and local investments into clean energy.

Who would it help?



The plan tries to fuse together the interests of labor unions and green activists who have been at odds over mining, drilling, and pipeline construction for years. The heavy emphasis on domestic manufacturing may appeal to unions, and she’s hoping to keep environmentalists happy by stimulating clean manufacturing.



Who opposes it?



Warren’s big-tent environmental vision may collapse without any specific carbon dioxide reduction targets.

287,Assange won’t face charges over role in devastating CIA leak,Natasha Bertrand,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will not face charges for publishing Vault 7, a series of documents detailing the CIA’s arsenal of digital code used to hack devices. | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images legal Assange won’t face charges over role in devastating CIA leak The decision surprised national security experts and some former officials, given prosecutors’ recent decision to go after the WikiLeaks founder on Espionage Act charges.

The Justice Department has decided not to charge Julian Assange for his role in exposing some of the CIA’s most secret spying tools, according to a U.S. official and two other people familiar with the case.

It’s a move that has surprised national security experts and some former officials, given prosecutors’ recent decision to aggressively go after the WikiLeaks founder on more controversial Espionage Act charges that some legal experts said would not hold up in court. The decision also means that Assange will not face punishment for publishing one of the CIA’s most potent arsenals of digital code used to hack devices, dubbed Vault 7. The leak — one of the most devastating in CIA history — not only essentially rendered those tools useless for the CIA, it gave foreign spies and rogue hackers access to them.

Story Continued Below

Prosecutors were stymied by several factors.

First, the government is facing a ticking clock in its efforts to extradite Assange to the United States from the United Kingdom, where he is being held. Extradition laws require the U.S. to bring any additional charges against Assange within 60 days of the first indictment, which prosecutors filed in March, accusing Assange of helping former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning hack into military computers.

Second, prosecutors were worried about the sensitivity of the Vault 7 materials, according to an official familiar with the deliberations over whether to charge Assange. Broaching such a classified subject in court risks exposing even more CIA secrets, legal experts said. The CIA has never officially confirmed the authenticity of the leaked documents, even though analysts widely believe them to be authentic.

“There is no question that there are leak cases that can’t be prosecuted against the leaker or the leakee because the information is so sensitive that, for your proof at trial, you would have to confirm it is authentic,” said Mary McCord, who was acting assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department until 2017. “So the irony, often, is that the higher the classification of the leaked material, the harder it is to prosecute.”

So instead, the Justice Department will go after Assange on the one count for allegedly assisting Manning and the 17-count Espionage Act indictment. There are no plans to bring any additional indictments prior to his extradition.

While the Manning leak indictment was an expected move, the Espionage Act charges startled the legal community as a potential precedent-setting action. Traditionally, the law has been used to punish government officials who reveal classified information, not the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information. Press freedom activists immediately warned that the case could criminalize everyday journalistic behavior, such as soliciting sensitive information from government sources.

Federal officials insist they have a strong case, arguing that Assange is not a journalist and intentionally published the names of confidential sources in war zones over the objections of national security officials.

“There is a comfort level within the national security establishment of where the charges ended up,” the U.S. national security official told POLITICO.

Still, just several months ago, numerous experts felt confident that prosecutors would also hit Assange with charges over Vault 7. Prominent national security journalist Marcy Wheeler predicted in February that DOJ would “very clearly go after Assange” for the Vault 7 disclosure, and that a sealed indictment against him in the Eastern District of Virginia was likely related to that leak — the CIA is, after all, headquartered in Virginia, as ABC noted . Assange himself reportedly expressed concern that prosecutors would charge him with crimes related to Vault 7.

DOJ has charged one person in the Vault 7 theft. A former CIA employee, Joshua Schulte, was indicted for transmitting the Vault 7 documents to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is set for November. In April, prosecutors in his case asked the judge to keep the search warrants confidential because disseminating them could “impede ongoing investigations,” prompting more speculation over potential charges against Assange.

“Going after Assange for the Vault 7 leak would seem to involve more serious misconduct and have fewer” press freedom implications, said Carl Tobias, the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond Law School in Virginia. He noted that authorities have mechanisms, like redaction and judge reviews, to protect sensitive information.

But prosecutors have not accused Assange of coaxing Schulte to release the CIA tools, as they allege Assange did with Manning. According to court documents, Assange asked Manning for specific classified documents and advised her on how to hack into a government computer.

Manning is in jail over her refusal to testify before a grand jury in the Assange case. Her lawyers have argued that if the Justice Department does not intend to bring further charges against Assange, the previous need for her testimony should be rendered moot.

“If indeed the government has concluded their investigation, then there is no further need to coerce her compliance with the grand jury, and thus, there can be no legitimate ongoing reason to hold her in contempt,” Moira Meltzer-Cohen, an attorney for Manning, told POLITICO. “If the investigation has ended, then Chelsea must be released.""

WikiLeaks began releasing the Vault 7 documents in April 2017, prompting then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to slam the organization as a “hostile intelligence service.”

The exposed documents describe how the CIA’s secretive Center for Cyber Intelligence developed malware, viruses and weaponized “zero-day” exploits, or flaws in technology like smartphones and internet-connected TVs that are not yet known to the manufacturer.

Legally, the CIA can use these cyber weapons only against foreign targets, not against U.S. citizens. But WikiLeaks said at the time that it was given the documents by a former U.S. government hacker or contractor concerned about “whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers.”

Assange’s release of the Vault 7 tools jeopardized a potential immunity deal that law enforcement officials had been weighing for him in early 2017 in exchange for his testimony about WikiLeaks’ ties to Russian intelligence officers, according to The New York Times.

289,Republicans ready to quash Cuccinelli,Burgess Everett,"The fight over Ken Cuccinelli's potential nomination to head U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is again pitting the president against his own party in Congress. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo congress Republicans ready to quash Cuccinelli The GOP-led Senate is relishing the chance to derail the nomination of Trump’s immigration pick.

Ken Cuccinelli has spent years attacking Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans. Now, it’s time for payback.

President Donald Trump wants Cuccinelli, who most recently led the anti-establishment Senate Conservatives Fund, to be director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. But there may be nobody in Washington whom McConnell and his allies would take more pleasure in defeating, and the bottom line is Cuccinelli has little chance of getting approved for the job, Republican senators said.

Story Continued Below

“He’s spent a fair amount of his career attacking Republicans in the Senate, so it strikes me as an odd position for him to put himself in to seek Senate confirmation,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who ran the GOP’s campaign arm for two election cycles. “It’s unlikely he’s going to be confirmed if he is nominated.”

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate GOP’s chief vote-counter, called the bid “a long shot,” adding, “They’ll go forward with it or they won’t, but I will suspect he’ll have plenty of obstacles once he gets here.”

The nascent nomination fight is again pitting the president against his own party in Congress. Just this spring, because of strong and very public opposition from Senate Republicans, Trump yanked his two preferred picks for the Federal Reserve’s board of governors before they even had been formally nominated.

And immigration has been a particular sore spot: Every leadership position at the Department of Homeland Security related to immigration is filled only by people serving in an acting capacity — and White House officials are mulling the prospect of having Cuccinelli do the same.

Some senators are still hoping to persuade Trump not to formally nominate or appoint Cuccinelli, but if the president goes through with it, the former Virginia attorney general likely will be either rejected or blocked from a floor vote entirely.

White House officials said Cuccinelli, always spoiling for a fight, is enthusiastic about another clash with McConnell. In a statement for this story, Cuccinelli showed no signs of backing down.

“My focus right now is on achieving President Trump’s immigration goals. It would certainly be my hope that senators’ primary interest is in the accomplishment of policy rather than politics,” he said.

The pushback against Trump’s attempt to install an immigration hard-liner to run the country’s legal immigration system is the climax of Senate Republicans’ yearslong battle with Cuccinelli and his organization, which has tried to oust GOP incumbents in favor of more conservative challengers. Cuccinelli joined in 2014, shortly after McConnell trounced Senate Conservatives Fund-backed opponent.

Cuccinelli also has taken aim at some of the senators needed to confirm him — calling on McConnell to resign as majority leader, backing Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race to the chagrin of the GOP rank and file, and criticizing the record of Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) as a “major disappointment.”

“You’re always held to what you’ve said,” Burr said when reminded of Cuccinelli’s criticisms.

Though Cuccinelli was initially slated to be the Trump administration’s immigration czar, a position the president considered creating to oversee and coordinate immigration policy, the White House changed plans in late May. And even if he never actually takes charge at USCIS, White House officials said simply being discussed for a position that requires Senate confirmation could lend additional heft to an alternative role.

Trump has occasionally floated contentious appointments to Senate Republicans — including McConnell — with no intention of nominating the individuals, according to sources familiar with his remarks. He’d then tell aides he was doing so only to make subsequent nominees seem more palatable.

Whether the president is dangling Cuccinelli’s nomination in the same spirit is unclear, but Trump officials signaled his elevation after McConnell publicly panned Cuccinelli in remarks to reporters in April.

On Tuesday, McConnell reiterated in a brief interview his strong “lack of enthusiasm” for Cuccinelli.

“It seems to me to be very difficult [to confirm him], based upon what I have read that McConnell says. I get the opinion that McConnell is not going to bring it up,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. “So if McConnell’s not going to bring it up, it ain’t going to come up.”

Grassley predicted Cuccinelli will be temporarily installed in an acting role. If Trump wants to avoid a fight with the Senate GOP, he may seek to install Cuccinelli at USCIS in an acting capacity, according to two current and former DHS officials with knowledge of the process.

Cuccinelli’s elevation itself is a blow to Grassley, whose former staffer Francis Cissna was ousted from USCIS despite Grassley’s pleas to keep him amid Trump’s broader purge of the Department of Homeland Security.

Grassley said Cissna was “trying to do everything Trump wants done but doing it in a lawful way. It seems to me we’re a government based on the rule of law. You ought to respect people who are trying to abide by it.”

USCIS, which oversees the country’s immigration and naturalization system, is led by acting Director Mark Koumans, who took the helm this month after Cissna was pushed out. The possibility that Cuccinelli could serve a long period of time as an acting official wouldn’t be unprecedented. Thomas Homan — a former ICE official — led that agency for a year and a half.

The Cuccinelli nomination reflects the persistent bind Trump has faced when it comes to immigration. Senate Republicans are reluctant to confirm the sorts of people who share his views, such as Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state who was considered as a replacement for former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Trump’s preferred Federal Reserve picks, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, were scuttled by GOP resistance. And Cuccinelli could be headed for the same buzz saw, though one Senate Republican worried “then we get Kris Kobach, who’s probably worse.

“I don’t know why the president keeps putting these people out without just making a few phone calls and saying: ‘Can you confirm this person?’” the senator said.

Yet those like Nielsen who have gained Senate approval have quickly fallen out of favor with the president and his top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller.

And not all senators share leadership’s view. Some came to the Senate after the peak of Senate Conservatives Fund’s power earlier this decade.

“It’s the president’s call,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. “I do worry sometimes that we’re going in a direction more where the only people that can be considered for appointments, you have to be computers or live in a cocoon or have never been active. That’s not realistic.”

Cramer was one of the leading opponents of Cain’s elevation to the Fed, which cratered in April. But he said that job is different than USCIS: “It’s not just the person but the position you consider them for.”

But there may be nobody in Washington whom McConnell and his allies would take more pleasure in defeating, and the bottom line is Cuccinelli has little chance of getting approved for the job, Republican senators said.

“He’s spent a fair amount of his career attacking Republicans in the Senate, so it strikes me as an odd position for him to put himself in to seek Senate confirmation,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who ran the GOP’s campaign arm for two election cycles. “It’s unlikely he’s going to be confirmed if he is nominated.”

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate GOP’s chief vote-counter, called the bid “a long shot,” adding, “They’ll go forward with it or they won’t, but I will suspect he’ll have plenty of obstacles once he gets here.”

The nascent nomination fight is again pitting the president against his own party in Congress. Just this spring, because of strong and very public opposition from Senate Republicans, Trump yanked his two preferred picks for the Federal Reserve’s board of governors before they even had been formally nominated.

And immigration has been a particular sore spot: Every leadership position at the Department of Homeland Security related to immigration is filled only by people serving in an acting capacity — and White House officials are mulling the prospect of having Cuccinelli do the same.

Some senators are still hoping to persuade Trump not to formally nominate or appoint Cuccinelli, but if the president goes through with it, the former Virginia attorney general likely will be either rejected or blocked from a floor vote entirely.

White House officials said Cuccinelli, always spoiling for a fight, is enthusiastic about another clash with McConnell. In a statement for this story, Cuccinelli showed no signs of backing down.

“My focus right now is on achieving President Trump’s immigration goals. It would certainly be my hope that senators’ primary interest is in the accomplishment of policy rather than politics,” he said.

The pushback against Trump’s attempt to install an immigration hard-liner to run the country’s legal immigration system is the climax of Senate Republicans’ yearslong battle with Cuccinelli and his organization, which has tried to oust GOP incumbents in favor of more conservative challengers. Cuccinelli joined in 2014, shortly after McConnell trounced Senate Conservatives Fund-backed opponent.

Cuccinelli also has taken aim at some of the senators needed to confirm him — calling on McConnell to resign as majority leader, backing Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race to the chagrin of the GOP rank and file, and criticizing the record of Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) as a “major disappointment.”

“You’re always held to what you’ve said,” Burr said when reminded of Cuccinelli’s criticisms.

Though Cuccinelli was initially slated to be the Trump administration’s immigration czar, a position the president considered creating to oversee and coordinate immigration policy, the White House changed plans in late May. And even if he never actually takes charge at USCIS, White House officials said simply being discussed for a position that requires Senate confirmation could lend additional heft to an alternative role.

Trump has occasionally floated contentious appointments to Senate Republicans — including McConnell — with no intention of nominating the individuals, according to sources familiar with his remarks. He’d then tell aides he was doing so only to make subsequent nominees seem more palatable.

Whether the president is dangling Cuccinelli’s nomination in the same spirit is unclear, but Trump officials signaled his elevation after McConnell publicly panned Cuccinelli in remarks to reporters in April.

On Tuesday, McConnell reiterated in a brief interview his strong “lack of enthusiasm” for Cuccinelli.

“It seems to me to be very difficult [to confirm him], based upon what I have read that McConnell says. I get the opinion that McConnell is not going to bring it up,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. “So if McConnell’s not going to bring it up, it ain’t going to come up.”

Grassley predicted Cuccinelli will be temporarily installed in an acting role. If Trump wants to avoid a fight with the Senate GOP, he may seek to install Cuccinelli at USCIS in an acting capacity, according to two current and former DHS officials with knowledge of the process.

Cuccinelli’s elevation itself is a blow to Grassley, whose former staffer Francis Cissna was ousted from USCIS despite Grassley’s pleas to keep him amid Trump’s broader purge of the Department of Homeland Security.

Grassley said Cissna was “trying to do everything Trump wants done but doing it in a lawful way. It seems to me we’re a government based on the rule of law. You ought to respect people who are trying to abide by it.”

USCIS, which oversees the country’s immigration and naturalization system, is led by acting Director Mark Koumans, who took the helm this month after Cissna was pushed out. The possibility that Cuccinelli could serve a long period of time as an acting official wouldn’t be unprecedented. Thomas Homan — a former ICE official — led that agency for a year and a half.

The Cuccinelli nomination reflects the persistent bind Trump has faced when it comes to immigration. Senate Republicans are reluctant to confirm the sorts of people who share his views, such as Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state who was considered as a replacement for former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Trump’s preferred Federal Reserve picks, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, were scuttled by GOP resistance. And Cuccinelli could be headed for the same buzz saw, though one Senate Republican worried “then we get Kris Kobach, who’s probably worse.

“I don’t know why the president keeps putting these people out without just making a few phone calls and saying: ‘Can you confirm this person?’” the senator said.

Yet those like Nielsen who have gained Senate approval have quickly fallen out of favor with the president and his top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller.

And not all senators share leadership’s view. Some came to the Senate after the peak of Senate Conservatives Fund’s power earlier this decade.

“It’s the president’s call,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. “I do worry sometimes that we’re going in a direction more where the only people that can be considered for appointments, you have to be computers or live in a cocoon or have never been active. That’s not realistic.”

Cramer was one of the leading opponents of Cain’s elevation to the Fed, which cratered in April. But he said that job is different than USCIS: “It’s not just the person but the position you consider them for.”

Mike Lee said in a statement. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo technology GOP lawmakers divided on House antitrust tech probe The House Judiciary Committee launched a probe Monday to look at whether Silicon Valley’s tech titans have engaged in anti-competitive conduct.

Republicans are split over a new Democrat-led antitrust investigation of the tech industry, highlighting tensions between the GOP's growing criticism of companies like Google and Facebook and the party's traditional aversion to regulating business.

The House Judiciary Committee launched the probe Monday to look at whether Silicon Valley's tech titans have engaged in anti-competitive conduct — and some Republican lawmakers were quick to cheer their Democratic colleagues on.

“I'm all for it,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said of the House probe, while fellow Senate Judiciary member John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters that it's about time for Congress to examine how the online industry's growing power affects consumers.

“Look I’m very proud of the large social media companies,"" Kennedy told reporters. ""They’re all American companies. They’ve been extraordinarily successful. That’s why they’re so big. But they’re not companies anymore — they’re countries.”

Other congressional Republicans tempered their enthusiasm, however. And others responded with distinct caution to the idea of Congress taking on an antitrust role that's normally in the hands of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission — both of which have lately taken an interest in tech giants such as Google and Amazon.

“Antitrust is a highly technical inquiry, not something that lends itself to easy generalizations or blanket condemnations,” said a statement from Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who chairs the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel that would be in a prime position to oversee a probe. “This is why such investigations are best left to the antitrust agencies rather than Congress.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a leading critic of the tech industry, agreed that federal regulators would be “more effective” than Congress in policing the issue. He suggested that lawmakers should instead focus on issues like protecting consumers' data privacy.

The reactions underscore the dueling impulses of Republicans when it comes to tech in the Trump era. Many have railed against internet giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter, particularly over what they see as an anti-conservative bias in the way the companies manage content. Some have dangled the prospect of taking away the industry's longtime liability protections. But most Republicans also hew to the party's instinctive distaste for anything that smacks of regulation — let alone trust-busting.

The GOP's more hawkish tech critics include Graham, who has complained about the unregulated “wild wild West” of social media companies and said he's ""certainly willing to look into their business model"" as well. Another is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has accused digital platforms of suppressing conservative speech.

“I was glad to see the House launch that investigation and I’d love to see Senate Judiciary Committee do the same,” Cruz said.

House Democrats have yet to lay out the full scope of the probe. But Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee that is spearheading the congressional investigation, specifically named Google, Facebook and Amazon as a “significant part” of it during his announcement Monday. He said he's prepared to issue subpoenas and compel witnesses to testify if needed.

House Judiciary's top Republican, Doug Collins of Georgia, and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the top Republican on its antitrust panel, initially praised the Democrats' probe, with Collins calling the effort a ""bipartisan"" opportunity to explore whether the tech industry remains competitive and “if necessary, to take action.”

But a GOP committee aide later sought to draw some boundaries around that support, suggesting the two Republican lawmakers are leery of some of the more aggressive tactics Cicilline mentioned.

Collins and Sensenbrenner have agreed to “less formal oversight activity to look into big tech,"" said the aide, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak on the record. The aide added that ""there has not been bipartisan agreement to scrutinize, subpoena, compel testimony from or start a critical investigation” into specific companies.

That reluctance contrasts with some of the fiery rhetoric Republicans have brandished as they take aim at perceived bias on the part of Google, Facebook and Twitter, which deny any political favoritism in the way they manage their platforms.

Several GOP lawmakers, including Cruz and Hawley, have even floated the idea of revisiting a 1996 law that gives websites immunity from lawsuits over content their users have posted. It's a critical provision for the internet industry, shielding companies from expensive litigation if something libelous pops up in a search result, YouTube video or Facebook post, for example.

The tech antitrust issue isn't likely to dissipate for Republicans anytime soon, with the topic taking center stage in the Democratic presidential field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called for a breakup of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is backing calls to split up Facebook.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department has opened the door to its own possible antitrust investigation of Google, although it has yet to say whether it will launch such a probe. People familiar with DOJ's activities confirmed to POLITICO and other news organizations last week that the department has taken jurisdiction over any potential Google probe as part of a recent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.

The Justice Department has also claimed jurisdiction over any antitrust claims involving Apple, while the FTC would handle any investigations of Facebook and Amazon, according to news reports and sources familiar with the cases. The two agencies periodically get together to divide up companies in industry groups and determine which agency will handle an investigation, should there be infractions that would warrant investigation, an FTC official has told POLITICO.

Whether any of these procedural moves will blossom into full-blown investigations, or result in fines or other penalties, is still unclear. But all four companies have faced complaints in both the U.S. and Europe from rivals who accuse them of abusing their dominant roles.","| J.

This is their life right now, and Democrats haven’t found a way out of their dilemma.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi thinks impeachment is a bad idea without GOP support — of which there is almost none — but refuses to shut the door on it entirely, fearing doing so would alienate the party base. Other Democratic leaders, such as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, suggest impeachment is inevitable one day only to back away the next. Democrats’ internal polling shows it’s not a hot topic for voters, yet for outside activists, it’s the only issue, one they believe will define the party for years to come.

Pelosi’s hold on rank-and-file Democrats remains strong, and there’s no sign that the divide among Democrats has damaged her position internally. Yet more than one-quarter of her caucus — almost 60 members — publicly supports opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump. And that number is slowly growing.

The challenge for Pelosi has become whether she can keep her members in line while Trump continues to all but dare her to impeach him, a move Republicans — and some Democrats — are convinced will benefit the GOP, maybe even leading the GOP back to the majority next year.

“It would be disastrous — and Speaker Pelosi has hit on this — if we proceed with impeachment and we fail in the Senate just as people are going to the polls. That will be a vindication of Trump and it will help him in the final election,” Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/1547/1155968404_6042481997001_6042468649001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) agreed, saying, ""From the endgame point of view, if we move forward and impeach [Trump] and the Senate does not find him guilty, then, I think we’ve helped his ability to win next year.”

Democratic leaders are doing all they can to hold the Pelosi ""investigate, not impeach"" line, which is in fact contributing to the Democrats' impeachment problem.

Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, chairwoman of House Democrats’ campaign arm, touted new polling during a leadership meeting Monday night showing Democrats still have a sizable lead on the generic ballot and voters care significantly more about health care and jobs than impeachment, according to several sources.

And Pelosi tried to ease simmering tensions within the caucus during a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning, urging lawmakers to be respectful of their colleagues’ differing positions on the issue.

“While we may have our differences on the timing and how we deal with holding this president accountable for his, in my view, criminal violation of the Constitution,” Pelosi told members, “we should not question anybody’s insistence on honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

Pelosi sent a letter to her members later in the day urging them to focus on a different issue — health care — and plan events centered on the topic for Flag Day next weekend.

“To succeed, we need to be fully prepared by the end of this week for what will be happening on June 14 — which is Flag Day, a day where we talk about liberty and justice for all,” she wrote. “Access to health care is an important part of that freedom.”

“Impeachment is not on the table impeachment is not off the table, because we’re in fact-gathering mode,” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, a member a member of the Judiciary Committee. “That’s why we’re going to continue to pursue our constitutional responsibilities and do it in a thoughtful and responsible fashion.

“We’re at the beginning of the process, not the middle or the end,” Jeffries added, although he noted “the overwhelming majority of the caucus” isn't calling for impeachment yet.

Democrats have passed several major messaging bills — including the DREAM Act on Tuesday — but nothing that will be considered by the GOP-controlled Senate.

But the pro-impeachment faction inside the Democratic Caucus — which is composed almost entirely of Democrats from safe districts — has painted the decision in starkly moral terms, casting it as an enshrined duty to hold the president to account.

“It’s, I believe, completely unacceptable” not to impeach Trump, said Rep. Jared Huffman, who represents a deep-blue district in California. “I just can’t get my head around how anyone could argue that even in the face of compelling, impeachable offenses and overwhelming evidence ... that we would decline to do our job.”

""I think there's three different groups,"" Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) added. ""Those that want to impeach now; those that are willing to do an impeachment inquiry — that's what we're talking about, an impeachment inquiry — they just want to have a couple more things locked into place, and a small but not very vocal minority that says, 'No impeachment ever.'""

Others in the caucus, meanwhile, are staring down the reality of what they see as a path to the minority.



“I’ve heard enough of Mueller,” Rep. Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat who represents a district Trump won in 2016, said of the former special counsel. “The point is, the Senate’s not going to take it up, so, what does it accomplish?”

Moderate freshman Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), who said he’s spoken with Democratic leaders about tamping down talk on impeachment, stressed that discussing impeachment is fine but shouldn’t dominate every conversation.

“We need people to say, 'Look, we got this thing over here, but it’s not the only thing by far,'” Van Drew said. “We need to get work done.”

But with Pelosi refusing to extinguish the idea all together, the debate that is causing a considerable rift within the caucus is sure to linger throughout the summer.

Mueller’s appearance before the cameras last week garnered a few high-profile impeachment converts, although most House Democrats returned to Washington entrenched in their previous positions.

“If I was in Trump’s situation, of course I would want impeachment because it plays right into my messaging frame,” said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), who predicted more Democrats will join the push to oust Trump while also praising Pelosi's decision not to impeach him. “It’s become the preoccupation of the [political] arena.”

Jared Huffman, who represents a deep-blue district in California. “I just can’t get my head around how anyone could argue that even in the face of compelling, impeachable offenses and overwhelming evidence ... that we would decline to do our job.”

This is their life right now, and Democrats haven’t found a way out of their dilemma.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi thinks impeachment is a bad idea without GOP support — of which there is almost none — but refuses to shut the door on it entirely, fearing doing so would alienate the party base. Other Democratic leaders, such as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, suggest impeachment is inevitable one day only to back away the next. Democrats’ internal polling shows it’s not a hot topic for voters, yet for outside activists, it’s the only issue, one they believe will define the party for years to come.

Pelosi’s hold on rank-and-file Democrats remains strong, and there’s no sign that the divide among Democrats has damaged her position internally. Yet more than one-quarter of her caucus — almost 60 members — publicly supports opening an impeachment inquiry into Trump. And that number is slowly growing.

The challenge for Pelosi has become whether she can keep her members in line while Trump continues to all but dare her to impeach him, a move Republicans — and some Democrats — are convinced will benefit the GOP, maybe even leading the GOP back to the majority next year.

“It would be disastrous — and Speaker Pelosi has hit on this — if we proceed with impeachment and we fail in the Senate just as people are going to the polls. That will be a vindication of Trump and it will help him in the final election,” Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said.

Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, in a turnaround, now says the House should begin an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

In an interview with USA Today on Monday, the Nevada Democrat said that “it’s not the right thing to do nothing” about allegations that Trump obstructed justice in the Russia investigation. But he also said “it’s not the right thing to jump into impeachment without doing an inquiry.” Reid added that an impeachment inquiry would help determine where public opinion is on the issue.

Reid’s comments are a reversal from few weeks ago, when he told The New York Times that he had concerns similar to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s about a possible political backlash if the House moved forward on impeachment. Reid, who was in the Senate during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial 20 years ago, told The Times that Clinton benefited from House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry.

Reid’s change of tune comes as Pelosi is facing mounting pressure from members of her caucus to begin impeachment proceedings.

The pastor of a Northern Virginia church where President Donald Trump made an unscheduled visit over the weekend has explained why he publicly prayed for the president, acknowledging to his congregation that “some within our church … are hurt that I made this decision.”

“Sometimes we find ourselves in situations that we didn’t see coming, and we’re faced with a decision in a moment when we don’t have the liberty of deliberation, so we do our best to glorify God,” Pastor David Platt of McLean Bible Church said Sunday evening in a statement to church members titled “Prayer for the President.” “Today, I found myself in one of those situations.”

Hours earlier, Trump’s motorcade made an unannounced detour to the church while returning to the White House from Trump National Golf Club in nearby Sterling, Va.

“President Donald J. Trump is visiting McLean Bible Church in Vienna, VA, to visit with the Pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach,” Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement on Sunday, referring to the mass shooting at a municipal complex that left 13 people dead, including the gunman.

Platt explained in the statement to his congregation that he had been caught off guard.

“At the end of my sermon at the 1:00 worship gathering, I stepped to the side for what I thought would be a couple of moments in quiet reflection as we prepared to take the Lord’s Supper,” he said. “But I was immediately called backstage and told that the President of the United States was on his way to the church, would be there in a matter of minutes, and would like for us to pray for him.”

Platt, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s International Mission Board, also explained that he prayed for the president because 1 Timothy 2:1-6 urges, in part, that Christians pray “for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.”

Trump, wearing a blazer over his golf clothes, stood on a stage while Platt prayed.

Afterward, “the president walked off stage without comment, and we closed our gathering by celebrating heroes among us, a couple who has spent the last 48 years spreading the gospel in remote places where it had never gone before they came,” Platt said in his statement. “We then recited the Great Commission as we always do, sending one another out into the city for the glory of our King.”

Platt went on to explain that he had no intention of endorsing the president, his policies or the Republican Party, and said he was sharing details “because I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision.”

“This weighs heavy on my heart,” he continued. “I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God’s Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God.”

A day earlier, the president thanked the evangelist and missionary Franklin Graham for his announcement of a “Special Day of Prayer for the President,” scheduled for Sunday.

“We will all stick together and WIN! Thank you Franklin,” Trump tweeted on Saturday.

301,Biden girds for clash with Trump over China,Nahal Toosi,"Advisers say Vice President Joe Biden can point to some of his past face-offs with the Chinese to prove his mettle. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images 2020 elections Biden girds for clash with Trump over China The Democrat's aides say he's relishing the fight, believing his message of confidence in American might will overcome Trump’s alarmist rhetoric and trade fights.

Donald Trump’s campaign is itching to take on Joe Biden over his pro-free trade past and his comments downplaying the China threat — an issue Republicans see as especially potent in critical Rust Belt states where Trump is struggling and the former vice president has strength.

But in interviews with POLITICO, several current and former Biden aides said his recent rhetoric calling fears of China’s rise overblown was no gaffe. They say Biden relishes going to battle with Trump over China, certain that his message of confidence in American might will prevail over Trump’s alarmist rhetoric and tariff-driven trade war with Beijing.

“Trump’s erratic and impulsive approach to China is causing families economic pain,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager. “Joe Biden would rally our friends and allies to hold China accountable.”

How to manage the rise of China is one of the trickiest and most important foreign policy issues in the 2020 race, one that affects voters’ wallets while also speaking to grander, even existential questions about America’s global standing. It has caused divisions within both the Democratic Party and the GOP, pitting protectionists against free-traders.

Biden is in a unique spot. He has spent significant time with China’s leaders, and his long foreign policy track record as a senator and vice president offers lots of fodder — sometimes the same fodder — for friends and foes alike on China. His nuanced message also has made it easy for critics to take liberties with his words.

This week, conservatives blasted Biden after he appeared to blow off the China threat by telling a New Hampshire audience: “Our workers are literally three times as productive as workers … in Asia. So what are we worried about?”

Afterward a Fox Business commentator called Biden ""either massively naïve or deliberately trying to be provocative.""

And last month in Iowa, Biden seemed to dismiss Beijing by saying, “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man! …They’re not competition for us.” Trump slammed Biden’s comments as “very dumb” and some of Biden’s 2020 Democratic primary competitors piled on, too.

“It’s wrong to pretend that China isn’t one of our major economic competitors,” tweeted the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, which has criticized free trade deals Biden supported while serving as No. 2 to Barack Obama.

Aides to Biden insist his comments have been taken out of context.

Biden believes without question that “China presents a real challenge, real competition,” one aide said. But he won’t play on people’s fears that China is taking over the world or that America’s heyday is over, the person said. And instead of just talking about the need to be tough on China as Trump does, Biden will cast himself as “tough but smart.”

“Vice President Biden doesn’t bet against America,” a different Biden aide said.

The advisers say Biden can point to some of his past face-offs with the Chinese to prove his mettle.

In 2013, Beijing declared the creation of an “air defense identification zone” in the East China Sea, infuriating the U.S. and allies such as Japan. Biden traveled to China with a stern message: the U.S. wasn’t going to recognize the zone. In fact, U.S. military aircraft had already flown through it without Chinese permission and would keep doing so.

“No one should underestimate or question [America’s] staying power” in the Asia-Pacific, Biden said later in South Korea, after his private sessions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“His message to Xi in Beijing was, ‘We’re going to show you and the world it doesn’t count,’” a former Obama administration official close to Biden recalled. “You guys shouldn’t be doing this kind of thing because we’re going to ...operate as though it doesn’t exist.’”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2949/1155968404_6041958516001_6041957451001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

“It was interesting because Xi didn’t know what to say. Biden, in a way, dictated the pace,” the former official added.

Another example of a Biden-driven success, advisers said, was his lesser-known role in a 2015 deal between China and the U.S. to curb cyber espionage on private companies, attacks that often saw China stealing trade secrets from U.S. firms.

Biden helped persuade Xi that such commercial spying was a separate issue from the more traditional, and more acceptable, political espionage both governments have long carried out, aides to the former vice president said.

Biden also spent many hours with Xi as part of the Obama administration’s efforts to “rebalance” U.S. foreign policy to focus more on Asia and China in particular. So the Democrat can say he knows exactly who he’s up against were he to win the White House.

Biden aides declined to give specifics about the Democrat’s plans on the highly sensitive issue of trade; the campaign is expected to roll out a trade agenda in the coming months.

They indicated, however, that Biden will point to the many trade-related disputes the Obama administration won against China through the World Trade Organization as an example of how he would be tough and use existing tools to hold Beijing accountable. Biden also will call for major new investment in U.S. infrastructure, education and more to ensure that Americans retain a competitive edge over the Chinese.

Perhaps above all, Biden plans to emphasize that, unlike Trump, he will rally other countries to America’s side to present a united front against China.

Emphasizing alliances also gives Biden an avenue to defend the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive multi-national trade agreement that the Obama administration helped craft in part to counter China. Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the TPP and many progressive Democrats oppose it as well.

Biden aides argue that Trump’s go-it-alone approach to Beijing undermines his blunt talk about holding Beijing accountable for its aggressions on trade and other fronts, especially because the president has little to show for it.

If Trump’s tariffs stay in place, the trade war continues and prices keep going up for Americans, Biden aides expect even Trump’s support in rural areas will fade by this time next year. If Trump does strike a trade deal with China, Biden aides are betting they can poke holes in it.

But Republicans see weaknesses in Biden where his aides see strength. They note that China never rescinded the air defense identification zone and point to reports that the cyber agreement is falling apart.

Biden may think the Obama administration outsmarted the Chinese, but the Chinese probably believe otherwise because they are thinking long term, said a Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration. “Their approach on things like the ... air defense zone is incrementalism,” he said.

Even some critics of the Obama-Biden approach to China said they deserve credit for recognizing that the rise of China required a “rebalance” in U.S. foreign policy.

But attitudes toward China are hardening within both parties as the scale of China’s ambitions become clearer and Trump’s willingness to confront the Chinese head on has gained resonance. Defending the Obama team’s more cool-headed approach could be more difficult in this environment.

The Trump campaign certainly intends to use Biden’s record against him.

“Donald Trump is the first president to stand up to China’s decades-long record of cheating and unfair trade practices,” Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ”Joe Biden, incredibly, dismisses China as an economic competitor, so it’s little wonder that while Biden was in office he welcomed China’s rise and sat back and watched as the Chinese ate America’s lunch.”

Biden may have another weak spot on China: questions about his son Hunter’s business dealings there. A lawyer for Hunter Biden has dismissed allegations of wrongdoing, according to media reports, but that doesn’t mean Trump won’t use his megaphone to talk about them.

Democratic strategists and others who watch the U.S.-China relationship closely say that Trump’s support in states such as Iowa has yet to degrade in any meaningful way, possibly because the president has promised billions in bailouts to farmers battered by the trade war.

But if Biden wants to gain votes beyond his base, he will need to fine tune his message, and show a little more teeth against Beijing, some said.

“I would suggest that Vice President Biden probably is a little bit off target when he says they’re not a major competitor,” said Kirk Leeds, chief executive officer of the Iowa Soybean Association.

But he and others said what could really move votes toward Biden is if he offers detailed plans about his strategy toward China. That includes how the U.S. plans to recapture parts of the Chinese market it may lose as the trade war keeps up.

“Farmers do not want bailouts from the government,” said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democratic strategist. “They want to have access to a market. And they want certainty that they’ll have access so they can plan.”

Biden aides agreed with that assessment.

“We have the most divisive president in modern memory,” one said, “but people are really not so interested in fighting, they’re interested in fixing.”

303,"In race to 2020, no podcast is too small for Dem candidates",Michael Calderone,"Sen. Kamala Harris speaks with host Mark Thompson during an interview at SiriusXM's New York Studios on April 5. | Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for SiriusXM 2020 elections In race to 2020, no podcast is too small for Dem candidates In a packed field, candidates are seizing every opportunity to reach a fragmented voting public that doesn’t always watch the evening news.

Preet Bharara surprised his own mother during last week’s interview with presidential candidate Andrew Yang.

She texted him after his podcast was released, not about Bharara and Yang’s debate over the policy of universal basic income, but about the pair’s discussion of bigotry and bullying growing up. Bharara had revealed on “Stay Tuned” that he faced racial taunts during a school trip to a planetarium.

“I hadn’t intended to go where I went,” Bharara said in an interview.

That willingness to veer away from the horserace and the drama that drives TV news into more personal territory is precisely why the podcast Bharara’s been taping for a year and a half — after President Donald Trump ousted him as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in March 2017 — has become part of an unlikely group of media outlets landing interviews with 2020 Democratic candidates.

Podcasts, late-night programs and web shows are increasingly serving as off-ramps from the daily news churn, offering candidates opportunities for more freewheeling conversations and showing off their personalities or pop culture bonafides to a variety of audiences. And in a packed Democratic field, candidates are seizing every opportunity to reach a fragmented voting public that doesn’t always watch the evening news.

“I got time to talk to Pete Buttigieg about political philosophy,” said Bharara, referring to the South Bend, Indiana mayor. “We talked about Immanuel Kant and John Rawls. How often do you hear a conversation about that? That happens on a podcast like mine. It doesn’t happen on MSNBC. It allows candidates to show another and deeper side.”

Democratic presidential candidates aren’t about to turn down invites from MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow or the “Morning Joe” crew, with the exception of Joe Biden, who has been eschewing most media interviews. They’ll surely keep hitting town hall stages on CNN and Fox News and must-stops like ABC’s “The View” and CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” And everyone wants to make this month’s debate on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.

But in addition, Sen. Cory Booker shot hoops in Newark with Desus Nice and The Kid Mero, the former Viceland hosts who launched Showtime's “Desus & Mero” in February. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told the late-night hosts in March why she’s running for president while cooking omelets in her Troy, New York home. Buttigieg will appear on Thursday night’s show.

“We want to talk to every single motherfucking one of them,” co-host Mero said of the 2020 field in April before rolling the Booker interview.

On Friday night in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will take the stage at “Political Party Live!”, a millennial-geared podcast that’s already hosted Yang, California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. Booker will join the show Saturday from Gene’s Bar in Iowa City.

Candidates have also talked to former Obama strategist David Axelrod and Vox’s Ezra Klein, and at least a dozen 2020 hopefuls have flocked to “Pod Save America,” which, though only launched in early 2017, has become a mainstay in Democratic politics.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/812/1155968404_6036791815001_6036794945001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

“Smart campaigns are looking for forums that allow their candidates to connect with engaged audiences, break out of the 30-second soundbite culture of cable, and talk about more than Trump's latest tweet,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior Obama adviser and co-host of “Pod Save America.”

“The advantage of many of these platforms is that they are evergreen and can be consumed on demand hours, days and weeks after the interview,” Pfeiffer said. “The more traditional platforms are ephemeral.”

Candidates have experimented with non-traditional or niche platforms in recent cycles. Hillary Clinton went on Buzzfeed’s “Another Round” podcast in 2016, where the hosts asked her why they never saw her sweating; ""I'm really not even a human being,” Clinton responded. “I was constructed in a garage in Palo Alto.""

Peter Hamby, who began hosting Snapchat’s “Good Luck America” show during the 2016 election, noted that “new formats and new shows have been evolving and mutating since the birth of the smartphone” more than a decade ago.

“But candidates and campaigns are being less smug about new platforms and new shows,” he said. “They’re more willing to step into the breach because they realize you have to be on all screens at all times of the day.”

“A lot of people just consume an entirely different set of media than a lot of the people in Washington and New York who are making political news,” said Hamby, a former CNN reporter.

It’s also been a long time since the Democratic field had so many candidates, all of whom want a lighthearted, viral moment that makes them memorable to voters.

Still, there are risks for candidates when stepping away from more conventional political shows.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren discussed issues like taxing corporations and reparations for slavery over more than 45 minutes last Friday on Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club,” the nationally syndicated hip-hop morning show that’s become a destination for 2020 contenders.

But co-host Charlamagne tha God also challenged Warren’s past identification as Native American, an issue that’s largely faded from mainstream political coverage. ""You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal,” he said, referring to a white woman who identified as black.

On Friday’s “Vice News Tonight,” Charlemagne said he’s glad candidates are visiting “The Breakfast Club,” though he was blunt about their political calculations. “They’re only coming here because of the large listening audience,” he said, “and it’s a large listening audience of black and brown people.”

Buttigieg, who appeared on “The Breakfast Club” in March, has embraced a wide spectrum of media venues, from Hugh Hewitt’s conservative radio show — a must-stop during the 2016 Republican primary — to TMZ Live, where the candidate talked policy, pop culture and busted out a guitar. More recently, Buttigieg made headlines after stopping by a TMZ camera to defend NFL kneeling protests and point out Trump’s lack of military experience.

“It’s ultimately the candidate who determines the success of these things. There’s no magic recipe,” said Lis Smith, a Buttigieg communications adviser who has spearheaded an ambitious media strategy for a Midwestern mayor who had little national name recognition before getting in the race.

More Coverage: Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris on the Breakfast Club.

Smith recalled driving with Buttigieg in March as the candidate noticed a flurry of mentions on Twitter after his interview with Bharara, which took place before the candidate broke out on national television during a CNN town hall.

“Preet asked questions that aren’t on cable news,” she said, allowing for a conversation “that is 20 levels deeper” than most TV news shows. (Bharara said the Buttigieg interview was one of his best performing podcasts to date).

Iowa politician Stacey Walker and millennial business owners Veronica Tessler and Simeon Talley launched “Political Party Live!” in 2016 to engage young progressive Democrats and promote diverse voices in state politics. And like any good party, the hosts made sure there was beer, pizza, and music to go along with the political talk.

The appearance by Harris in February helped open the floodgates this cycle in terms of candidates coming on the show.

“This is the first time we’ve ever been a force in the presidential selection process in Iowa,” said Walker, who said the team is talking to several campaigns beyond the six candidates who have appeared or agreed to do so.

“Our hope is to be a resource to Iowans,” he said. “Iowans really do take their role being the first-in-the-nation caucuses state seriously. I think the candidates know that.”

Bharara said he and his team are talking this week about which candidate to invite next. He stressed that listeners want a “thoughtful discussion” — and said he’s not bound by the rigid criteria to get on the TV debate stage.

“For our podcast,” he said, “we don’t have some DNC-inspired formula of polling and donors that will determine when they do or don’t get airtime.”

304,The first post-9/11 vets are running for president. Do voters care?,Jacqueline Feldscher,"Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, an Afghanistan veteran, speaks at a Democratic convention in San Francisco. | Jeff Chiu/AP Photo Politico/morning consult poll The first post-9/11 vets are running for president. Do voters care?

Afghanistan vet Pete Buttigieg charged President Donald Trump with an ""assault on the honor of this country"" for avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), recounting his four tours in Iraq, told voters he hopes the man who took Trump's place in combat is ""still alive."" And Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) drew on her war experience in warning Trump that a war with Iran would make Iraq ""look like a cakewalk.""

Together, the Democratic trio mark the first post-9/11 veterans to run for the White House. But military credentials that once helped pave candidates' road to the White House may hold little appeal for today's electorate, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll of registered Democratic voters released Wednesday.

Story Continued Below

More than half of respondents said it's not important for the party's presidential nominee to be a veteran, while only a third said military service in the candidate’s background is very or somewhat important to their decision. Twelve percent had no opinion at all.

""Our polling suggests 2020 contenders who tout military credentials won’t necessarily have an advantage when Democrats cast their votes at the ballot box,” said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult’s vice president. “Notably, 36 percent of Democratic voters said it was important for their party’s nominee to be a military veteran. This compares to 69 percent who prioritize political experience.”

The poll of 1,997 registered voters was conducted between May 31 and June 2 and has a margin error of 2 percent.

The three candidates are all banking on their experience to give them a boost, but the results are another indication that military service — even in the midst of the longest period of sustained combat in American history — is steadily fading as a major resume-builder for would-be commanders in chief.

Three of the four most recent presidents — Trump, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton — didn't have a military background (George W. Bush had served in the Air National Guard). That's compared with all eight of the previous chief executives, all of whom served in the military: Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

And throughout the nation's history, more than half of all Oval Office occupants have worn a uniform.

The recent trend is credited to a number of factors, including the makeup of the armed forces and the changing nature of war. The U.S. has no mandatory conscription, which ended in the final stages of the Vietnam War, and exceedingly few Americans volunteer to serve in the armed forces — less than 1 percent. As a result, far fewer Americans can personally relate to the military than when a much larger proportion of the population either served or knew someone who did.

Americans have not yet had time to reckon with the consequences of the ongoing wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Matthew Gallagher, an author and Iraq veteran who has written about electing veterans as president.

“It’s dark and complex and messy. It’s not as simple as it was for the greatest generation to say, ‘I proved myself in combat, I can prove myself in government,’” Gallagher said in an interview. “It’s not something that resonates as widely. It’s an open question as to whether it resonates at all beyond a very small percentage of voters.”

On the stump, however, the recent veterans running for president — all considered long shots for the Democratic nomination — are relying heavily on their military credentials.

“I decided that if people with my experience didn’t step up and run, we’d never truly learn the lessons of what it means to carelessly put Americans into harm's way,” Moulton, a three-term congressman from Massachusetts, told POLITICO.

Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii who deployed to Iraq as a member of Hawaii’s Army National Guard and remains a major, has called for an end to “wasteful regime change wars” and recently tweeted that Trump is risking another war with Iran.

Buttigieg, who spent six months in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve, recently posted on Twitter that his service in the military “makes me very aware of the consequences of sending troops abroad, and personally committed to ending endless war.”

Trump says he doesn't want war with Iran, but that's exactly what he wants, because that's exactly what Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu, al-Qaeda, Bolton, Haley, and other NeoCons/NeoLibs want. That’s what he put first--not America. pic.twitter.com/kAPyxlKXDs — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) May 14, 2019

For one thing, it makes me very aware of the consequences of sending troops abroad, and personally committed to ending endless war. It also taught me how US lives depend not just on our weaponry, but on global trust and affection for our country, which are now sadly in decline. https://t.co/Fc6tZGgdrG — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) February 8, 2019

All three candidates are also using their military service as a bludgeon against Trump, who secured multiple deferments from the draft during the Vietnam War for attending college and also received a medical exemption for bone spurs in his feet.

Buttigieg accuses Trump of using his wealth and connections to fake the bone spurs to get out of going to war.

“You have somebody who thinks it’s all right to have somebody go in his place into a deadly war and is willing to pretend to be disabled to do it. That is an assault on the honor of this country,” Buttigieg said May 26 on ABC’s “This Week.”

Moulton says he volunteered so others wouldn’t have to, while Trump “was happy to have someone else go in his place.”

“I’d like to meet that American someday who went to Vietnam in Donald Trump’s place,"" Moulton said recently. ""I hope he’s still alive.""

He also contends Trump “is a man who truly does not understand the consequences of war.”

They are all banking on their military credentials help them stand out in a crowded field of nearly two dozen Democrats, even if they don't propel them all the way.

Their military background could help them establish credibility on defense and security issues, countering the fact that they are younger and have less experience overall than some of the other contenders, said Jeremy Teigen, a political science professor at Ramapo College of New Jersey.

“For Buttigieg, Moulton and Gabbard, their service will not give them an instant promotion to the top tier, but it will help them stand out against the other younger, less visible candidates,” Teigen said.

Gabbard is 38, Buttigeig is 37 and Moulton is 40. Any one of them would be the youngest president in history if elected.

Their experience may also resonate with some older voters who place more emphasis on military credentials, added Molly O’Rourke, the director of American University’s masters program in political communications, who specializes in public opinion research.

Whether it helps bring them electoral success or not, Moulton, Gabbard and Buttigieg are unlikely to be the last post-9/11 vets to seek the presidency.

Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been running for local and federal offices since 2006 and have now garnered enough experience to move up the hierarchy, said Jeremy Butler, the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a nonpartisan advocacy group.

And he said having the three in the 2020 presidential race could ultimately help elevate critical veterans issues like health care, as more people who have direct experience with the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs achieve the power to make decisions.

Moulton, for example, recently shined a light on the problem of post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans by revealing he has sought therapy and unveiling a plan to improve mental health services for veterans.

Their candidacies could also prompt even more veterans to run for office, said Ellen Zeng, senior vice president of With Honor Action, a political action committee that helps veterans run for office. She said the group is talking to more than 80 veterans thinking about running for the House in 2020.

305,Democrats line up for chance to take down Devin Nunes,Carla Marinucci,"The race for Rep. Devin Nunes' seat in 2020 is getting crowded. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo 2020 Elections Democrats line up for chance to take down Devin Nunes

SAN FRANCISCO — Rep. Devin Nunes — the lightning rod House Intelligence Committee member who was nearly knocked off in the midterm — will face a 2020 Democratic challenge from a Fresno Latino businessman who charges the California GOP congressman has been silent on the proposed “Trump tax” tariffs that he says will slam Central Valley farmers and consumers.

Phil Arballo, 40, a financial adviser, cites Nunes’ unflagging support of President Trump’s policies as evidence that the seven-term Republican has failed to stay in touch with the economic concerns of his Central Valley constituents. Of special concern, he said, has been Nunes’ failure to stand up for farmers and business people when it comes to Trump’s calls for tariffs on goods from Mexico, California’s largest trading partner.

Story Continued Below

“We haven’t heard anything from Devin on how this is hurting our farmers,’’ said Arballo in an interview, telling POLITICO he will officially launch his run against Nunes Thursday. “That’s going to come back to haunt us, and consumers are going to be paying for it down the road.”

Arballo, the third Democrat to file for the seat, has received the strong backing of Andrew Janz, who raised $9.2 million in a surprisingly close 2018 loss to Nunes in the Republican-oriented district.

“Phil Arballo is our best chance to defeat Devin Nunes, hands down,’’ said Janz, in a statement to POLITICO. “I’m proud to support Phil and know that he’ll be the champion the Valley needs.""

In the conservative Central Valley district, where Republicans have a 9 percentage point voter registration advantage, Janz came within 5 points of defeating Nunes. But the Fresno prosecutor has opted out of a rematch — deciding instead to make a bid for Fresno mayor this time around.

Nunes raised $12.6 million in 2018, and spent $11.5 million in 2018 to maintain his seat, according to OpenSecrets.org.

Arballo told POLITICO in his first campaign interview Wednesday that he plans to stress how the Central Valley has been cheated by Nunes in its congressional representation. The GOP congressman, he said, has been more interested in pushing his national profile as a Fox News regular and defender of President Trump on issues like the Russia probe and impeachment than in addressing issues in his district with his own constituents.

Last October, Trump suggested that Nunes deserves the Medal of Freedom — the nation's highest civilian honor — for his controversial efforts to push back against the Russia investigation.

“I don’t believe impeachment is going to be a topic’’ that is top of mind to Democratic voters, said Arballo, an active member of the Fresno Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “What is going to matter here in the Valley is everyday things” that will affect local pocketbooks and livelihoods, he said. With GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy calling on Republicans to back the tariffs, “that’s going to be a hot topic’’ in the race ahead, as will health care issues and the concerns about the viability of the Affordable Care Act, he said.

Arballo, who is Mexican-American and the son of a single mother, says his personal background — he was raised in Fresno and is a graduate of Fresno State, is married to a linguistics teacher, and is the father of two — gives him a much closer understanding of the lives of Central Valley voters. Latinos outnumber white voters by 46-40 percent in the district, and could represent a key advantage in the next race if Democrats succeed in boosting their turnout, campaign insiders say.

“With the national turnout what it was last time around, we’re excited to see more Latinos and more people of color in the district. There’s a hunger out there from the base...and people will be knocking on doors and excited to engage in the race with Nunes and with [Duncan] Hunter,’’ the embattled San Diego congressman who has also been named as a target by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said one Democratic Party insider who spoke not for publication.

Arballo acknowledges that, while many voters in the district are conservative and supported Trump, an increasing number are disenchanted ""that [Nunes] is using them for a political game...he chooses to be in Washington,’’ instead of returning back home to his district to hear their concerns.

Arballo criticized Nunes, who has limited his public appearances in recent years, saying

“Pete Buttigieg has done more town halls here than Devin has’’ — a reference to the South Bend, Indiana, Democratic presidential candidate who held a town hall meeting last week in Fresno.

The San Luis Obispo Tribune reported that Nunes plans a June 28 fundraiser in that city — which is not located in his district — in a location his campaign apparently attempted to keep under wraps to thwart protesters. But the @DevinCow Twitter parody account, posted by Republican strategist Liz Mair, revealed the location as the tony Thousand Hills Ranch in Pismo Beach. The county party’s website shows a fundraiser listed, but only indicates the presence of a “special guest.”

Nunes’ high profile as the former Intelligence Committee chair and author of the “Nunes Memo” made him a hero to conservatives and a target of the left on social media — fueling fundraising on both sides of the aisle.

Nunes’ effort the sue the @DevinCow Twitter parody account, and Republican strategist Liz Mair, as well as an additional Twitter parody account called @DevinNunesMom, has made him the object of derision in social media circles. The @DevinCow account earned half a million new followers in the wake of that suit, and Mair has been supported by online fundraising for legal defense.

But the California Target Book, a non-partisan tracking of state races, reported that Nunes raised $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 and ended with $4,915,893 on hand — the 3rd-largest campaign war chest for any House incumbent in the country, behind only California Democrat Adam Schiff ($5,541,987) and Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi ($5,174,470).

Already, the race against Nunes is getting crowded. Bobby Bliatout — the third place Democratic candidate in 2016 — has announced he’s making a second run at the seat, and another Democrat, Dary Rezvani, has also filed.

“With the national turnout what it was last time around, we’re excited to see more Latinos and more people of color in the district. There’s a hunger out there from the base...and people will be knocking on doors and excited to engage in the race with Nunes and with [Duncan] Hunter,’’ the embattled San Diego congressman who has also been named as a target by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said one Democratic Party insider who spoke not for publication.

Arballo acknowledges that, while many voters in the district are conservative and supported Trump, an increasing number are disenchanted ""that [Nunes] is using them for a political game...he chooses to be in Washington,’’ instead of returning back home to his district to hear their concerns.

Arballo criticized Nunes, who has limited his public appearances in recent years, saying

“Pete Buttigieg has done more town halls here than Devin has’’ — a reference to the South Bend, Indiana, Democratic presidential candidate who held a town hall meeting last week in Fresno.

The San Luis Obispo Tribune reported that Nunes plans a June 28 fundraiser in that city — which is not located in his district — in a location his campaign apparently attempted to keep under wraps to thwart protesters. But the @DevinCow Twitter parody account, posted by Republican strategist Liz Mair, revealed the location as the tony Thousand Hills Ranch in Pismo Beach. The county party’s website shows a fundraiser listed, but only indicates the presence of a “special guest.”

Nunes’ high profile as the former Intelligence Committee chair and author of the “Nunes Memo” made him a hero to conservatives and a target of the left on social media — fueling fundraising on both sides of the aisle.

Nunes’ effort the sue the @DevinCow Twitter parody account, and Republican strategist Liz Mair, as well as an additional Twitter parody account called @DevinNunesMom, has made him the object of derision in social media circles. The @DevinCow account earned half a million new followers in the wake of that suit, and Mair has been supported by online fundraising for legal defense.

But the California Target Book, a non-partisan tracking of state races, reported that Nunes raised $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 and ended with $4,915,893 on hand — the 3rd-largest campaign war chest for any House incumbent in the country, behind only California Democrat Adam Schiff ($5,541,987) and Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi ($5,174,470).

Already, the race against Nunes is getting crowded. Bobby Bliatout — the third place Democratic candidate in 2016 — has announced he’s making a second run at the seat, and another Democrat, Dary Rezvani, has also filed.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that the @DevinCow Twitter parody account is affiliated with Republican strategist Liz Mair. Rep. Devin Nunes has filed a $250 million defamation suit against both Mair and that Twitter account -- in addition to another parody account labeled @DevinNunesMom.","The race for Rep. Devin Nunes' seat in 2020 is getting crowded.
“Phil Arballo is our best chance to defeat Devin Nunes, hands down,’’ said Janz, in a statement to POLITICO.
In the conservative Central Valley district, where Republicans have a 9 percentage point voter registration advantage, Janz came within 5 points of defeating Nunes.

Both sides of the abortion battle are focused on the future of Roe v. Wade, but opponents have already won the ground game over the past decade, chipping away at abortion access.

The Supreme Court’s new conservative majority, about to wrap up its first term, has not yet taken up a case challenging Roe. Just this week it declined to reinstate an Indiana law, signed by Mike Pence when he was governor, that would have banned abortion on the basis of gender, race or fetal disability. But that’s no guarantee the court won’t take another look at the landmark 1973 abortion rights ruling.

But even without the high court, GOP-backed laws have added restrictions and obstacles, whittling away access. Since the start of the Trump administration, hostility to abortion in general and Planned Parenthood in particular has only intensified in statehouses around the country.

“We celebrate freedom in America. But I believe that my choice ends when another life begins,” Louisiana state Rep. Valarie Hodges said just before a fetal ""heartbeat"" abortion bill passed there.

Years of piecemeal state laws have left their mark. Mandatory waiting periods, travel, missed work and lost wages all make getting an abortion more expensive and more difficult, particularly for low-income women. Doctors and clinic staff have to face protesters, threats, proliferating regulations and draining legal challenges; clinics have closed. In remote parts of the midwest and south, women may have to travel more than 300 miles to end a pregnancy.

“This is a moment of seeing how all of these laws fly in the face of medicine and science and go against what we in the medical profession know, which is that any restriction on medical care by politicians will endanger people’s health,” Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, a physician herself, said in an interview.

It's intensified of late. Republicans in Alabama and other states have raced to enact laws that would almost completely ban abortion, sometimes without exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. Eight states have enacted laws which, if allowed to go into effect, would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, as early as the sixth week of pregnancy, when many women don’t even know they are pregnant. (Missouri’s variant is eight weeks.) Alabama has gone even further, granting “personhood” and legal rights from conception.

Those laws may eventually reach the Supreme Court and test Roe, the 1973 decision that recognized women’s right to abortion. But those statutes aren’t what’s crimping access nationwide right now. That’s happened through a drip, drip, drip of lower-profile efforts that have created obstacles for pregnant women and led to a dwindling supply of doctors trained and willing to perform abortions.

Many of those laws were promoted as attempts to make abortion safer — though courts often disagreed and threw them out as unconstitutional barriers. Now, abortion opponents are openly talking about ending the practice altogether.

“The strategy used to be death by a thousand cuts,” said Colleen McNicholas, a physician based in St. Louis who also provides abortions in Kansas and Oklahoma. “They’re no longer pretending things are to promote the health and well-being of women, which is what we used to hear all the time. Now they’re being very bold and upfront.”

“It doesn’t change the fact that for many Americans, particularly for women in the middle [of the country] and the South, abortion is inaccessible,” she added.

Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, shows that 788 clinics in the U.S. provided abortion services in 2014 — a drop of 51 clinics over three years. Since 2013 about 20 clinics have closed just in Texas.

Further, one in five women would have to travel at least 43 miles to get to a clinic, according to a Guttmacher analysis from October 2017. In North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, at least half of the women between 15 and 44 years old lived more than 90 miles from a clinic.

Six states — Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia — have only one clinic left that performs abortions, according to a recent analysis from Planned Parenthood and Guttmacher. Missouri’s was on the brink of closure at midnight Friday; a court delayed that and will hold another hearing on its status next week. Lawmakers in many of those states have pursued limits in when abortion can be allowed — such as fetal heartbeat laws or 15-week bans, though the laws have been blocked in court. Four of those states have also passed so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion immediately should the Supreme Court overturn Roe.

On the surface, the St. Louis clinic is a dispute with the state health department over licensing, safety and regulation. But the showdown comes just days after state lawmakers passed a ban on abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest.

“States have been marching down this path for a number of years. The restrictions that have passed previously have set the stage for the bans this year,” said Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher’s senior state issues manager. “It’s counseling, it’s waiting periods, it’s abortion coverage in your health plan. It’s limits on abortion providers, such as unnecessary clinic regulations.”

“Missouri is the first and other states could be next,"" Planned Parenthood’s Wen said on a recent call with reporters.

The ramifications of the anti-abortion movement’s sustained assault against Planned Parenthood are perhaps no clearer than in Texas, where lawmakers have passed dozens of restrictive laws, including mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods and state funding restrictions.

The Supreme Court overturned another set of Texas restrictions in 2016 — but not before about 20 clinics shut down, many of which were never able to reopen. Providers retired, staff found other jobs and clinics had to start from scratch to get licensed and staff up. “All of those things take time and a significant amount of money,” said Kari White, an associate professor in Health Care Organization and Policy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an investigator with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project.

Even though Texas permits abortions until 20 weeks — itself a cut-off point that conflicts with Roe v. Wade, although it hasn’t yet come to the Supreme Court — abortion access has sharply declined. That scenario is likely to play out in other conservative states, even if they don’t go as far as Georgia or Alabama.

More than half of Texas’ 41 abortion clinics closed or stopped performing abortions after the state passed legislation, TX HB2 (132), in 2013 that bundled several onerous restrictions, according to research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. The average distance a woman had to travel one way for an abortion jumped to 35 miles from 15 miles. In rural parts of the state, drives of 100 miles or more to access care are not uncommon, according to the group.

The evaluation project found that while the number of abortions overall declined after the Texas law went into effect, the number of second-trimester abortions rose as women were forced to wait and travel longer distances. Currently only about 22 abortion providers, mostly in urban areas, are operating in Texas, a state with roughly 6.3 million women of reproductive age.

Low-income women are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions, said Kamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women who can’t afford an abortion, which costs between $500 and $10,000 dollars depending on the point in pregnancy. The nonprofit was part of a group that challenged dozens of Texas abortion restrictions in court.

Calls to the group’s hotline have tripled over the past few years to 6,000 in 2018, but it only funded about 1,000 women last year, she said. Some of those women are undocumented immigrants, some are incarcerated and others have children but cannot afford to raise more.

Other costs mount — both in money and time, Conner said. Because Texas has a 24-hour waiting period between an initial consult and the abortion, women miss work and may have to pay for hotel rooms.

“There are fewer clinics to provide the services,” said Conner. “The few clinics that are left are in very high demand.”

Telemedicine could plug some gaps in care for women seeking abortion medication, instead of a surgical abortion. But there too access varies widely by geography. Some states ban telemedicine-facilitated abortions. Elsewhere, providers are using video-chat technology to dispense the medication. Seventeen states require licensed abortion providers to be physically present when administering abortion medication, which effectively is a ban on telemedicine, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Abortion medication is approved for use up to ten weeks into pregnancy, but under current FDA rules can only be dispensed at certain medical facilities, including abortion clinics.

Alternatives are being tested. In one FDA-reviewed study, clinicians can mail abortion medication directly to patients after a video chat. Study participants can go to any clinic for their screening and ultrasound, send the results to a participating abortion provider, and then video chat with that provider. If appropriate, the provider can decide to dispense the medication to the patient’s address, and the patient can take it at home.

Under this system, women don’t have to travel several hours just to pick up the abortion pills, Erica Chong, director of Gynuity Health Projects, told POLITICO. The Gynuity study has enrolled about 360 people across eight states since 2016; it builds on recent research concluding that telemedicine-facilitated medical abortions are just as safe for patients as the ones administered in-person.

Because it’s been reviewed by the FDA, the Gynuity trial is exempt from the dispensation limitation. The study operates in Maine, New York, New Mexico, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Georgia. Gynuity’s trial in Georgia began a few weeks ago, shortly before the state passed its “fetal heartbeat” law.

“With a lot of these bans, there’s going to be a long legal battle,” Chong said, explaining that she didn’t expect the new Georgia law, which bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected at about six weeks, to affect the study in that state just yet. But she noted that the recent spate of early abortion bans have alarmed patients, who are unsure whether their appointments are still legal.

Gynuity’s goal is to convince the FDA that dispensing abortion medication directly to women's homes, or even to retail pharmacies, is safe and effective, and that restrictions on its dispensation should be eased, Chong said.

Outside the Gynuity trial, some providers across the country let patients drive to the facility closest to them and video chat a clinician located at another site. Planned Parenthood, for instance, lets patients in 14 states virtually consult with clinicians based elsewhere. Yet in many cases, the clinician must watch the patient ingest the pill on screen to comply with federal restrictions limiting where the medication can be dispensed. Women might still have to travel across state lines to access these services — and many don’t even realize these options exist.

“How’s a woman in Alabama going to know to go to a Georgia clinic to find services?” Chong said.

Those laws may eventually reach the Supreme Court and test Roe, the 1973 decision that recognized women’s right to abortion. But those statutes aren’t what’s crimping access nationwide right now. That’s happened through a drip, drip, drip of lower-profile efforts that have created obstacles for pregnant women and led to a dwindling supply of doctors trained and willing to perform abortions.

Many of those laws were promoted as attempts to make abortion safer — though courts often disagreed and threw them out as unconstitutional barriers. Now, abortion opponents are openly talking about ending the practice altogether.

“The strategy used to be death by a thousand cuts,” said Colleen McNicholas, a physician based in St. Louis who also provides abortions in Kansas and Oklahoma. “They’re no longer pretending things are to promote the health and well-being of women, which is what we used to hear all the time. Now they’re being very bold and upfront.”

“It doesn’t change the fact that for many Americans, particularly for women in the middle [of the country] and the South, abortion is inaccessible,” she added.

Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, shows that 788 clinics in the U.S. provided abortion services in 2014 — a drop of 51 clinics over three years. Since 2013 about 20 clinics have closed just in Texas.

Further, one in five women would have to travel at least 43 miles to get to a clinic, according to a Guttmacher analysis from October 2017. In North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, at least half of the women between 15 and 44 years old lived more than 90 miles from a clinic.

Six states — Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia — have only one clinic left that performs abortions, according to a recent analysis from Planned Parenthood and Guttmacher. Missouri’s was on the brink of closure at midnight Friday; a court delayed that and will hold another hearing on its status next week. Lawmakers in many of those states have pursued limits in when abortion can be allowed — such as fetal heartbeat laws or 15-week bans, though the laws have been blocked in court. Four of those states have also passed so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion immediately should the Supreme Court overturn Roe.

On the surface, the St. Louis clinic is a dispute with the state health department over licensing, safety and regulation. But the showdown comes just days after state lawmakers passed a ban on abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest.

“States have been marching down this path for a number of years. The restrictions that have passed previously have set the stage for the bans this year,” said Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher’s senior state issues manager. “It’s counseling, it’s waiting periods, it’s abortion coverage in your health plan. It’s limits on abortion providers, such as unnecessary clinic regulations.”

“Missouri is the first and other states could be next,"" Planned Parenthood’s Wen said on a recent call with reporters.

The ramifications of the anti-abortion movement’s sustained assault against Planned Parenthood are perhaps no clearer than in Texas, where lawmakers have passed dozens of restrictive laws, including mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods and state funding restrictions.

The Supreme Court overturned another set of Texas restrictions in 2016 — but not before about 20 clinics shut down, many of which were never able to reopen. Providers retired, staff found other jobs and clinics had to start from scratch to get licensed and staff up. “All of those things take time and a significant amount of money,” said Kari White, an associate professor in Health Care Organization and Policy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an investigator with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project.

Even though Texas permits abortions until 20 weeks — itself a cut-off point that conflicts with Roe v. Wade, although it hasn’t yet come to the Supreme Court — abortion access has sharply declined. That scenario is likely to play out in other conservative states, even if they don’t go as far as Georgia or Alabama.

More than half of Texas’ 41 abortion clinics closed or stopped performing abortions after the state passed legislation, TX HB2 (132), in 2013 that bundled several onerous restrictions, according to research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. The average distance a woman had to travel one way for an abortion jumped to 35 miles from 15 miles. In rural parts of the state, drives of 100 miles or more to access care are not uncommon, according to the group.

The evaluation project found that while the number of abortions overall declined after the Texas law went into effect, the number of second-trimester abortions rose as women were forced to wait and travel longer distances. Currently only about 22 abortion providers, mostly in urban areas, are operating in Texas, a state with roughly 6.3 million women of reproductive age.

Low-income women are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions, said Kamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women who can’t afford an abortion, which costs between $500 and $10,000 dollars depending on the point in pregnancy. The nonprofit was part of a group that challenged dozens of Texas abortion restrictions in court.

Calls to the group’s hotline have tripled over the past few years to 6,000 in 2018, but it only funded about 1,000 women last year, she said. Some of those women are undocumented immigrants, some are incarcerated and others have children but cannot afford to raise more.

Other costs mount — both in money and time, Conner said. Because Texas has a 24-hour waiting period between an initial consult and the abortion, women miss work and may have to pay for hotel rooms.

“There are fewer clinics to provide the services,” said Conner. “The few clinics that are left are in very high demand.”

Telemedicine could plug some gaps in care for women seeking abortion medication, instead of a surgical abortion. But there too access varies widely by geography. Some states ban telemedicine-facilitated abortions. Elsewhere, providers are using video-chat technology to dispense the medication. Seventeen states require licensed abortion providers to be physically present when administering abortion medication, which effectively is a ban on telemedicine, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Abortion medication is approved for use up to ten weeks into pregnancy, but under current FDA rules can only be dispensed at certain medical facilities, including abortion clinics.

Alternatives are being tested. In one FDA-reviewed study, clinicians can mail abortion medication directly to patients after a video chat. Study participants can go to any clinic for their screening and ultrasound, send the results to a participating abortion provider, and then video chat with that provider. If appropriate, the provider can decide to dispense the medication to the patient’s address, and the patient can take it at home.

Under this system, women don’t have to travel several hours just to pick up the abortion pills, Erica Chong, director of Gynuity Health Projects, told POLITICO. The Gynuity study has enrolled about 360 people across eight states since 2016; it builds on recent research concluding that telemedicine-facilitated medical abortions are just as safe for patients as the ones administered in-person.

Because it’s been reviewed by the FDA, the Gynuity trial is exempt from the dispensation limitation. The study operates in Maine, New York, New Mexico, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Georgia. Gynuity’s trial in Georgia began a few weeks ago, shortly before the state passed its “fetal heartbeat” law.

“With a lot of these bans, there’s going to be a long legal battle,” Chong said, explaining that she didn’t expect the new Georgia law, which bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected at about six weeks, to affect the study in that state just yet. But she noted that the recent spate of early abortion bans have alarmed patients, who are unsure whether their appointments are still legal.

Gynuity’s goal is to convince the FDA that dispensing abortion medication directly to women's homes, or even to retail pharmacies, is safe and effective, and that restrictions on its dispensation should be eased, Chong said.

Outside the Gynuity trial, some providers across the country let patients drive to the facility closest to them and video chat a clinician located at another site. Planned Parenthood, for instance, lets patients in 14 states virtually consult with clinicians based elsewhere. Yet in many cases, the clinician must watch the patient ingest the pill on screen to comply with federal restrictions limiting where the medication can be dispensed. Women might still have to travel across state lines to access these services — and many don’t even realize these options exist.

“How’s a woman in Alabama going to know to go to a Georgia clinic to find services?” Chong said.

Abortion is still legal in the United States, but for women in vast swaths of the country it’s a right in name only.

Six states are down to only one abortion clinic; a court stepped in Friday to stop Missouri’s sole clinic from closing, at least for now. Some women seeking abortions have to travel long distances, and face mandatory waiting periods or examinations. On top of that, a new wave of restrictive laws, or outright bans, is rippling across GOP-led states like Alabama and Georgia.

Story Continued Below

Both sides of the abortion battle are focused on the future of Roe v. Wade, but opponents have already won the ground game over the past decade, chipping away at abortion access.

The Supreme Court’s new conservative majority, about to wrap up its first term, has not yet taken up a case challenging Roe. Just this week it declined to reinstate an Indiana law, signed by Mike Pence when he was governor, that would have banned abortion on the basis of gender, race or fetal disability. But that’s no guarantee the court won’t take another look at the landmark 1973 abortion rights ruling.

But even without the high court, GOP-backed laws have added restrictions and obstacles, whittling away access. Since the start of the Trump administration, hostility to abortion in general and Planned Parenthood in particular has only intensified in statehouses around the country.

“We celebrate freedom in America. But I believe that my choice ends when another life begins,” Louisiana state Rep. Valarie Hodges said just before a fetal ""heartbeat"" abortion bill passed there.

Years of piecemeal state laws have left their mark. Mandatory waiting periods, travel, missed work and lost wages all make getting an abortion more expensive and more difficult, particularly for low-income women. Doctors and clinic staff have to face protesters, threats, proliferating regulations and draining legal challenges; clinics have closed. In remote parts of the midwest and south, women may have to travel more than 300 miles to end a pregnancy.

“This is a moment of seeing how all of these laws fly in the face of medicine and science and go against what we in the medical profession know, which is that any restriction on medical care by politicians will endanger people’s health,” Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, a physician herself, said in an interview.

It's intensified of late. Republicans in Alabama and other states have raced to enact laws that would almost completely ban abortion, sometimes without exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. Eight states have enacted laws which, if allowed to go into effect, would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, as early as the sixth week of pregnancy, when many women don’t even know they are pregnant. (Missouri’s variant is eight weeks.) Alabama has gone even further, granting “personhood” and legal rights from conception.

315,North Macedonia’s Macron mission,Andrew Gray,"North Macedonia has already changed its name. Now it's trying to change minds.

The Balkan country, along with neighbor Albania, is aiming to get the green light this month to begin EU membership talks. For the second year in a row, the European Commission has recommended the start of talks for both countries. But EU member governments will make the decision, which will reveal a lot about how they envision the future of the Union and its relationship with the Western Balkans.

To get the go-ahead, Skopje and Tirana have to convince one person in particular — French President Emmanuel Macron.

France took the lead in blocking the start of talks for both countries a year ago and French officials have continued to express skepticism, suggesting North Macedonia and Albania fall short on democracy and the rule of law, and that the EU must reform itself before contemplating enlargement.

France's hard line is particularly vexing this year for North Macedonia, a country of some 2 million people that has even gone as far as changing its name (from Macedonia) as part of an agreement to settle a decadeslong dispute with Greece that blocked its path to membership of the EU and NATO.

France has not yet decided whether to support the start of EU membership talks for either North Macedonia or Albania, according to an Elysée Palace official

To counter French skepticism, Skopje is trying to appeal to Macron's enthusiasm for the European project. In an interview with POLITICO in Brussels, North Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov suggested blocking membership talks would not sit well with the French president's desire to lead and enhance the European Union.

""My job is to make it clear that it will be difficult to be seen as a country that has an ambition to lead Europe and shape Europe and at the same time be a country that misses opportunities for success in Europe,"" Dimitrov said.

He said the prospect of EU membership would help North Macedonia move closer to EU standards in areas such as accountability for politicians, media freedom and economic competitiveness. As such, enlargement is a way to demonstrate the power of ""European magnetism,"" Dimitrov said.

Dimitrov noted that not only the European Commission has declared his country is moving in the right direction. He reeled off assessments from think tanks, NGOs and the U.S. State Department that all point to progress on a range of indicators, from judicial independence to media freedom.

“We have managed to put the member states in the spotlight and to create an atmosphere where it is almost embarrassing to say no to the Macedonian file this year,” Dimitrov said. “Because saying no to our file endangers the seriousness of the EU towards a region that is geographically within the EU, encircled by EU member states. So the EU’s credibility is at stake now.”

Whether these arguments will have much effect on Macron — and countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, which have also expressed skepticism about enlargement — remains in the balance. EU ministers are due to review the two membership applications at a meeting in Luxembourg on June 18, although they may postpone a decision until later in the year. A unanimous decision is required to issue an invitation for membership talks.

An Elysée Palace official told POLITICO this week that France has not yet decided whether to support the start of membership talks for either North Macedonia or Albania.

""We’ve always been clear that the idea of rushing into enlargement is risky because there is a hypocrisy — we give these countries the feeling that they will be in Europe tomorrow when in reality it takes a very long time,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""And we give the impression to our public opinion that the only policy is enlargement instead of deepening [the EU] first.""

The official said France would reach a decision ""in a Franco-German way"" — a remark that suggests Paris and Berlin may try to find a common position as part of broader discussions on a range of issues. That will be no easy task, as Germany has been much more positive about enlargement than France.

Michael Roth, Germany's European affairs minister, declared last week that North Macedonia and Albania have carried out reforms demanded by Brussels and it is now up to the EU to keep its side of the bargain. He also argued that membership talks are a good way to maintain the EU's sway in its Balkan backyard, where rival powers such as Russia, China, Turkey and Gulf Arab states are all seeking to gain influence.

Opponents of enlargement cite problems with organized crime, corruption and political cronyism that plague the western Balkans, as well as its recent history of the wars of the 1990s, to argue that the region does not belong in the EU, at least not any time soon.

""While we were locked in the waiting room, Europe changed."" — North Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov

Dimitrov stressed that his country is not asking to join the EU now, only to begin the yearslong process of membership negotiations. Two other Western Balkan countries, Serbia and Montenegro, are already engaged in membership talks.

But Dimitrov acknowledged that EU members have cooled on the idea of enlargement in recent years. Taking in poorer countries such as Bulgaria and Romania has proved unpopular in much of Western Europe, fueling complaints from populist parties and voters about east-to-west migration.

“The road is more uphill and it’s more narrow,"" said Dimitrov, whose country was first recommended for membership talks by the Commission back in 2009. ""While we were locked in the waiting room, Europe changed.""

317,Why Britain needs a Brexit extension,Vince Cable,"LONDON — The European Parliament election in the U.K. last month showed the country has changed its mind on Brexit.

Nigel Farage’s upstart Brexit Party stole the headlines by coming first in the polls and gaining 29 seats in the new Parliament. But his apparent victory obscures a deeper truth about what voters want.

In reality, more people signed a petition earlier this year to revoke Article 50 than voted for the Brexit Party in the May election. The Liberal Democrats were hugely successful in the election — where we came second with 20 percent of the vote — because of our clear message to stop Brexit.

British voters are clearly fed up with the government’s inability to find a viable solution when it comes to Brexit. And a majority now understand that only a new Brexit referendum can solve the parliamentary deadlock.

We are closer than ever to securing such a second referendum. Indeed, it’s the option that makes sense.

The Conservatives and the Labour Party are facing discouraging polling figures, so calls on their part for a general election are unlikely.

Granting us another extension would also have the added benefit of letting the U.K. have a say in the process of selecting the next European Commission president.

Nor can Theresa May’s Brexit deal be renegotiated, despite what a number of Tory leadership candidates claim in their misleading appeals to Brexit voters. The conditions of previous Brexit extensions granted to us by the European Union clearly state that the agreement can’t be reopened.

Regardless of what hard-line Brexiteers like Farage may claim, our parliament clearly does not want a no-deal Brexit either. The outgoing prime minister tried to blackmail parliament into voting for her Brexit deal three times, saying it was a choice between her Brexit deal and no deal. British MPs rejected that threat and we will do so again if it comes to it.

So where does this leave us? The government’s infighting and inability to compromise has left us at the mercy of our European partners.

Being granted the time to hold a second referendum also means we may be able to maintain our place in the EU for good and remain close partners.

French President Emmanuel Macron was reluctant to grant the U.K. an extension to the process the last time we faced crashing out without a deal in March. He could well decide to refuse a further extension when time runs out again on October 31.

I know European leaders are exasperated. I share that sentiment. But there are good reasons to give Britain a little more leeway if we ask for it.

Eventually the next Conservative prime minister — who will be elected in July — will realize that the promise of a second referendum must be attached to the existing Brexit deal to get it through parliament. The U.K. would then need extra time to legislate for it and to hold the vote.

Granting us another extension would also have the added benefit of letting the U.K. have a say in the process of selecting the next European Commission president.

As leader of the Lib Dems, which has partnered with Macron’s En Marche party as part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) in the European Parliament, I share the French president’s belief that the best way to restore credibility in European institutions is for our group to insist on selecting the best people for the top EU jobs.

Our MEPs have boosted the group’s ranks and would allow it to have more sway in these important discussions and in key votes.

But without an extension to the Brexit process in October — or a revocation of Article 50 before then — we will not have the chance to stand alongside our fellow MEPs.

Being granted the time to hold a second referendum also means we may be able to maintain our place in the EU for good and remain close partners.

It’s been a frustrating process — for all involved. But I’d urge Europe to keep in mind that the next time the U.K. requests an extension, it may be the one that gives us the time we need to finally end this Brexit nightmare once and for all.

The German Socialists announced Thursday they would put forward Udo Bullmann to continue as leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament a few hours after Iratxe García, a Spanish MEP, declared she would run.

""The German S&D delegation nominates Udo Bullmann for reelection as President of the Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament,"" Jens Geier, the head of the SPD delegation, said in a statement.

Garcia made her bid public in a statement issued on the S&D website, saying that she would push for a ""solid"" leadership of the group, making Europe ""more social, more diverse, more feminist, more together and more active on environment.""

The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, which now has 152 seats in the European Parliament, will elect their chairman on June 18.

The group's German SPD delegation lost almost half of its seats in the last European election, making Bullmann's chances of winning the group presidency less likely. By contrast, Spain's Socialist Party won six additional seats in the last election, making the party the largest delegation, and boosting García's chances.

322,Macron and Trump (almost) kiss and make up,Rym Momtaz,"French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump attend a D-Day memorial ceremony in Normany, France on June 6, 2019 | Ian Langsdon/AFP via Getty Images Macron and Trump (almost) kiss and make up The French president said the two shared the ‘same objectives’ on Iran.

CAEN, France — Donald Trump has stopped sending offensive tweets about Emmanuel Macron — for now — and instead the two men have a ""terrific"" and ""constructive"" relationship.

To mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day the two presidents embraced enthusiastically, solemnly commemorated the soldiers who liberated France from Nazism and honored American veterans. They then held a two-hour ""positive, constructive meeting ... that allowed [them] to see that we can work together, that there are margins for maneuver,"" according to an Elysée official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Yet there was no shortage of thorny, even divisive issues to discuss.

On Iran, Macron and Trump said they shared the ""same objectives,"" but the two leaders' comments reveal different approaches to tackling the problem.

""[Iran] can't have nuclear weapons and I think the president of France would agree,"" Trump said, looking to Macron as the two sat in a gilded room in the Caen prefecture before their meeting.

""I think we do share the same objectives on Iran,"" Macron agreed, speaking in English. But what he said afterward showed a real difference in approach.

""We want to reduce the ballistic activity ... we want to contain their regional activity"" and there is another ""common objective: peace in the region,"" Macron added, saying the way to deliver on these was to ""open a negotiation.""

""We want to make sure they don't get nuclear weapons,"" the French president said, adding that the Iran nuclear deal — which the U.S. exited in 2018 — was a way to ensure that happens. Macron notably chose not to mention the nuclear deal explicitly in the presence of Trump.

The French president's rhetoric on maintaining regional peace was also in stark contrast to recent statements from Trump.

Last month the American president threatened the country on Twitter, saying: ""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"" And when asked in a British TV interview during his state visit this week whether there could be a need for military action, he replied: ""There's always a chance.""

Nevertheless, France continues to try to ""open the dialogue"" between the U.S. and Iran, the Elysée official said.

Macron ""is a realist, he’s a diplomat who doesn’t tell himself tales, he wants to be able to leverage [everything] from incentives to pressure to get into a productive [dialogue],"" the official added.

A possible opening for negotiation may come when Japan's Prime Minister Shinzō Abe visits Iran next week, given Japan's unique position as a close American ally and a major consumer of Iranian oil.

""Prime Minister Abe is going to Iran with a shared objective to try to build a positive channel,"" according to the Elysée official.

The two presidents also discussed foreign trade, with the Elysée official indicating France was keen to make sure ""the rules of multilateralism are not ignored,"" and reiterating France's rejection of trade deals with countries that have exited the Paris climate agreement — a reference to the U.S.

It wasn't the first such reference to the need to reinforce the post-World War II international order that Trump's policies have placed under severe strain.

“Dear Donald Trump,” Macron said alongside the U.S. president at the American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer where they paid homage to fallen American soldiers.

“The United States is never greater than when it is fighting for the freedom of others ... We shall never cease to perpetuate the alliance of free peoples. That is what the victorious sides did, when they created the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,"" Macron continued. ""That is what a few years later the leaders of Europe did in bringing about the European Union. The lessons of Colleville-sur-Mer are clear: liberty and democracy are inseparable.”

Despite talk of the deep and abiding history between France and the U.S., Macron made several veiled references to the need for the U.S. to recommit to the transatlantic alliance throughout the day. It comes just after the French president's blunt remark in the wake of the European election, when he accused former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and by extension Trump, of working on ""dismantling"" the EU.

However, that didn't put a damper on Trump's mood, and his Twitter header picture was temporarily changed to the family photo of all the allied leaders present for the D-Day commemoration.

Upon landing in France, he tweeted it was ""a big and beautiful day"" and said ""the relationship we've had together [with Macron] has been terrific.""

It was in marked contrast with Trump's last visit to France, in 2018. He attacked Macron via Twitter soon after arriving, shortly after leaving and again a few weeks later — a diplomatic assault by a U.S. president on his French counterpart described as ""unprecedented"" by a second Elysée official.

Nonetheless, Thursday's meeting between the two men went on for ""longer than we thought,"" according to the first Elysée official, who quipped that even though ""you have a U.S. president who likes to golf,"" he left later than scheduled for a trip to his golf resort in Ireland.","French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump attend a D-Day memorial ceremony in Normany, France on June 6, 2019 | Ian Langsdon/AFP via Getty Images Macron and Trump (almost) kiss and make up The French president said the two shared the ‘same objectives’ on Iran.

328,Majority of Germans favor snap election: survey,Zia Weise,"Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel | Adam Berry/Getty Images Majority of Germans favor snap election: survey Only 27 percent say they want the current government to stay in power.

A majority of Germans favor a snap general election and ending the ""grand coalition"" between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats, a survey has found.

According to a YouGov poll published Thursday, only 27 percent of Germans surveyed want the current coalition government to remain in power, while 52 percent prefer calling a fresh election.

The poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 people between Monday and Wednesday this week, came after Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) last month scored their worst-ever results in a European election, with 28.9 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively.

The SPD's leader Andrea Nahles announced her resignation on Sunday after the party's poor showing in the European vote and in a simultaneous regional election that saw the SPD lose control of the city state of Bremen for the first time in more than 70 years.

Among SPD supporters, 58 percent back a snap election compared with only 36 percent of CDU/CSU voters, the survey found. A snap election could hasten the end of the Merkel era, as the chancellor said she would not run again in 2021, the year of the next general election.

Asked about their preferred coalition government, only 9 percent of respondents told YouGov they want another ""grand coalition.""

The most popular option is a left-wing coalition between the Greens, the SPD and the far-left Die Linke at 25 percent, followed by a coalition between the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) at 15 percent, and a CDU/CSU-Greens coalition at 14 percent.

Among Green voters, 54 percent favor a Greens-SPD-Left government, while only 25 percent wanted a CDU/CSU-Greens coalition.

Greens-SPD-Left coalitions exist in several parts of Germany on regional and local levels — the Greens this week proposed forming such a government in Bremen — but has never been attempted in the Bundestag. Talks to form a CDU/CSU-Greens-FDP coalition after the 2017 general election ended in failure.

The Greens, which came second in the European election in Germany with 20.5 percent, have experienced a surge in national polls. The former protest party polled at up to 20 percent before the European election in late May, but a series of surveys this month have shown them at 25-27 percent — within spitting distance or even ahead of the Christian Democrats.

On Thursday, public broadcaster ZDF's Politbarometer survey of about 1,250 people put the Greens at 26 percent and the CDU/CSU at 27 percent. The SPD was tied with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in a distant third place at 13 percent, according to the survey, which has an error margin of around 3 percentage points.

The polls project a meteoric rise for the Greens, currently the smallest bloc in the Bundestag. In the 2017 general election, the CDU/CSU won nearly 33 percent, followed by the SPD on 20.5 percent, the AfD on 12.6 percent, the FDP on 10.7 percent, Die Linke on 9.2 percent and the Greens on 8.9 percent.","Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel | Adam Berry/Getty Images Majority of Germans favor snap election: survey Only 27 percent say they want the current government to stay in power.

329,Bleak future ahead for Europe’s aluminum industry,Mario Conserva,"Via the Federation of Aluminium Consumers in Europe (FACE) Sponsored Content Bleak future ahead for Europe’s aluminum industry The EU’s aluminum industry is buckling under economically absurd tariffs, requiring swift relief

It’s May 2029, and all across the Continent, Europeans are driving to the polls to vote for the next European Parliament. Their routes take them past empty storefronts and shuttered factories, because despite decades of protests from the industry and empty promises from politicians, most of Europe’s main manufacturers have succumbed to the pressure of foreign competition and moved away.

As hundreds of thousands of jobs disappeared, once-thriving industrial regions turned into wastelands, rendering European markets dependent on imports of manufactured goods.

This might seem like an alarmist vision. But the strains on the EU’s aluminum sector, and the 1 million jobs that depend on it, raise worrying questions about the future of Europe’s industrial base in the absence of major policy changes. The industry’s growing vulnerability is a striking example of the inadequacy of public policies and industrial realities.

“The total suspension — or zeroing — of the EU’s tariffs is the only policy tool immediately available to protect the competitiveness and the survival of the EU’s downstream aluminum sector.”

A forthcoming study by the LUISS University of Rome, commissioned by the Federation of Aluminium Consumers in Europe (FACE), shows, in this strategic sector, how far Europe is from bringing about the “industrial renaissance” that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for. The study will be published on June 11.

An alarming decline

As a voice dedicated to the downstream aluminum sector, FACE commissioned the study to establish comprehensive analysis of the competitiveness of the aluminum value chain in the European Union. The downstream segment accounts for approximately 70 percent of the EU industry’s annual turnover and more than 92 percent of its jobs.

The study’s findings should come as a painful wakeup call in Brussels. The downstream segment has been stagnating for the past 17 years, largely due to artificially higher costs for its raw material (unwrought aluminum) caused by an economically absurd import tariff structure for the metal, which ranges from 3 percent to 6 percent. This harmful situation has saddled the many small and medium enterprises in the downstream sector with crushing extra costs of up to €1 billion per year.

The import tariff structure for the industry’s raw material — unwrought aluminum — was ostensibly implemented to protect Europe’s primary metal producers. But it has failed spectacularly. Not only have more than 10 smelters shut their doors over the past 20 years, with 3 million tons of production capacity lost, but Europe’s dependence on raw aluminum imports has widened from around 50 percent in 2000 to a stunning 74 percent in 2017.

he downstream segment has been stagnating for the past 17 years, largely due to artificially higher costs for its raw material (unwrought aluminum) caused by an economically absurd import tariff structure for the metal, which ranges from 3 percent to 6 percent.”

At the same time, aluminum demand continues to grow in the EU, stimulated by climate policies and social environmental choices. This increased demand is being captured by competitors outside the EU, while European manufacturers of high value-added aluminum applications see their competitiveness eroding.

To cover the shortage of primary aluminum — estimated at about 5.1 million tons in 2017 — the downstream sector must increasingly import metal from dutiable suppliers, which costs more. In this low-margin industry, where the raw metal amounts to as much as 60 percent of the cost of a semi-finished product, these higher prices invariably lead to lost customers —and shutdowns.

As a result, Chinese producers, who distort competition with unfair state support, underpriced exports and social and environmental dumping, have gobbled up a significant share of the market.

While small and medium enterprises in Europe suffered from artificially higher costs for their raw material, the EU import tariffs on unwrought aluminum benefited a handful of primary aluminum producers. They’re predominantly based outside the EU, and were able to cash in on the incremental price of the metal.

FACE has consistently denounced these artificially higher prices as hidden subsidies that penalize small companies in favor of large corporations.

This is why FACE is campaigning for the total suspension — or zeroing — of the EU’s tariffs on the industry’s raw material, unwrought aluminum. Suspension is the only policy tool immediately available to protect the competitiveness and the survival of the EU’s downstream aluminum sector.

An unequal, complex tariff regime

Following two successive, temporary and partial suspensions in 2007 and 2013, the customs duty rates are now 3 percent for non-alloyed unwrought aluminum, 4 percent for aluminum slabs and billets and 6 percent for foundry alloys. Importantly, the tariff rates do not apply to countries with which the EU has signed either preferential trade agreements or developing countries included in the so-called generalized scheme of preferences.

On paper, this looks encouraging: Countries like Mozambique (part of the generalized scheme of preferences) or Iceland (part of the duty–free European Economic Area) have been exporting growing quantities of the metal to Europe. In practice, however, a non-transparent market mechanism causes the import tariff to be included in the EU market premium for all aluminum sold, irrespective of its origin. The market aligns its EU premium to the highest level of the import tariff structure, or 6 percent, even if the metal has been produced in the EU or originates in a duty-free country. As a consequence, duty-free priced unwrought aluminum cannot be purchased by European companies, and it costs in average €120 per ton more than it should, a disaster for companies’ competitiveness.

import duties from 2000 to 2017 failed to prevent the closures of smelters and caused the downstream segment to stagnate.”

While EU smelters have closed because they are outdated and structurally uncompetitive, the downstream sector, which has the potential to develop, is suffering and risks going out of business under the burden of an absurd import tariff.

The LUISS study shows that this situation is suicidal: it found that import duties from 2000 to 2017 failed to prevent the closures of smelters and caused the downstream segment to stagnate. Meanwhile, aluminum demand grew at an average of 3 percent per year, hitting over 12 million tons annually in the EU.

The Continent’s aluminum industry faces an even bleaker next 20 years if the EU’s tariff on raw metal remains in force. That’s a near certainty.

Unless the EU crafts a new industrial policy, where trade measures truly support competitiveness and small and medium enterprises, the Juncker Commission’s ambitious “industrial renaissance” remain a distant dream for the aluminum sector. Instead, the vision of a continent stripped of its manufacturing base will become a painful reality for this strategic and environmentally friendly material.

They’re predominantly based outside the EU, and were able to cash in on the incremental price of the metal.

FACE has consistently denounced these artificially higher prices as hidden subsidies that penalize small companies in favor of large corporations.

This is why FACE is campaigning for the total suspension — or zeroing — of the EU’s tariffs on the industry’s raw material, unwrought aluminum. Suspension is the only policy tool immediately available to protect the competitiveness and the survival of the EU’s downstream aluminum sector.

An unequal, complex tariff regime

Following two successive, temporary and partial suspensions in 2007 and 2013, the customs duty rates are now 3 percent for non-alloyed unwrought aluminum, 4 percent for aluminum slabs and billets and 6 percent for foundry alloys. Importantly, the tariff rates do not apply to countries with which the EU has signed either preferential trade agreements or developing countries included in the so-called generalized scheme of preferences.

On paper, this looks encouraging: Countries like Mozambique (part of the generalized scheme of preferences) or Iceland (part of the duty–free European Economic Area) have been exporting growing quantities of the metal to Europe. In practice, however, a non-transparent market mechanism causes the import tariff to be included in the EU market premium for all aluminum sold, irrespective of its origin. The market aligns its EU premium to the highest level of the import tariff structure, or 6 percent, even if the metal has been produced in the EU or originates in a duty-free country. As a consequence, duty-free priced unwrought aluminum cannot be purchased by European companies, and it costs in average €120 per ton more than it should, a disaster for companies’ competitiveness.

import duties from 2000 to 2017 failed to prevent the closures of smelters and caused the downstream segment to stagnate.”

While EU smelters have closed because they are outdated and structurally uncompetitive, the downstream sector, which has the potential to develop, is suffering and risks going out of business under the burden of an absurd import tariff.

The LUISS study shows that this situation is suicidal: it found that import duties from 2000 to 2017 failed to prevent the closures of smelters and caused the downstream segment to stagnate. Meanwhile, aluminum demand grew at an average of 3 percent per year, hitting over 12 million tons annually in the EU.

The Continent’s aluminum industry faces an even bleaker next 20 years if the EU’s tariff on raw metal remains in force. That’s a near certainty.

Unless the EU crafts a new industrial policy, where trade measures truly support competitiveness and small and medium enterprises, the Juncker Commission’s ambitious “industrial renaissance” remain a distant dream for the aluminum sector. Instead, the vision of a continent stripped of its manufacturing base will become a painful reality for this strategic and environmentally friendly material.

It’s May 2029, and all across the Continent, Europeans are driving to the polls to vote for the next European Parliament. Their routes take them past empty storefronts and shuttered factories, because despite decades of protests from the industry and empty promises from politicians, most of Europe’s main manufacturers have succumbed to the pressure of foreign competition and moved away.

As hundreds of thousands of jobs disappeared, once-thriving industrial regions turned into wastelands, rendering European markets dependent on imports of manufactured goods.

This might seem like an alarmist vision. But the strains on the EU’s aluminum sector, and the 1 million jobs that depend on it, raise worrying questions about the future of Europe’s industrial base in the absence of major policy changes. The industry’s growing vulnerability is a striking example of the inadequacy of public policies and industrial realities.

“The total suspension — or zeroing — of the EU’s tariffs is the only policy tool immediately available to protect the competitiveness and the survival of the EU’s downstream aluminum sector.”

A forthcoming study by the LUISS University of Rome, commissioned by the Federation of Aluminium Consumers in Europe (FACE), shows, in this strategic sector, how far Europe is from bringing about the “industrial renaissance” that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for. The study will be published on June 11.

An alarming decline

As a voice dedicated to the downstream aluminum sector, FACE commissioned the study to establish comprehensive analysis of the competitiveness of the aluminum value chain in the European Union. The downstream segment accounts for approximately 70 percent of the EU industry’s annual turnover and more than 92 percent of its jobs.

The study’s findings should come as a painful wakeup call in Brussels. The downstream segment has been stagnating for the past 17 years, largely due to artificially higher costs for its raw material (unwrought aluminum) caused by an economically absurd import tariff structure for the metal, which ranges from 3 percent to 6 percent. This harmful situation has saddled the many small and medium enterprises in the downstream sector with crushing extra costs of up to €1 billion per year.

The import tariff structure for the industry’s raw material — unwrought aluminum — was ostensibly implemented to protect Europe’s primary metal producers. But it has failed spectacularly. Not only have more than 10 smelters shut their doors over the past 20 years, with 3 million tons of production capacity lost, but Europe’s dependence on raw aluminum imports has widened from around 50 percent in 2000 to a stunning 74 percent in 2017.

he downstream segment has been stagnating for the past 17 years, largely due to artificially higher costs for its raw material (unwrought aluminum) caused by an economically absurd import tariff structure for the metal, which ranges from 3 percent to 6 percent.”

At the same time, aluminum demand continues to grow in the EU, stimulated by climate policies and social environmental choices. This increased demand is being captured by competitors outside the EU, while European manufacturers of high value-added aluminum applications see their competitiveness eroding.

To cover the shortage of primary aluminum — estimated at about 5.1 million tons in 2017 — the downstream sector must increasingly import metal from dutiable suppliers, which costs more. In this low-margin industry, where the raw metal amounts to as much as 60 percent of the cost of a semi-finished product, these higher prices invariably lead to lost customers —and shutdowns.

As a result, Chinese producers, who distort competition with unfair state support, underpriced exports and social and environmental dumping, have gobbled up a significant share of the market.

333,Europe’s new energy dependency,Miguel Arias Cañete,"Combatting climate change is, by definition, a global task.

Europe has shown it’s ready to take a leading role in this fight: Legislation proposed by the European Commission and making its way through the EU institutional process sets out how the bloc can become the world’s first economy to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

But we can’t go it alone: Decarbonizing the Continent won’t lessen our dependence on the rest of the world.

The Commission has prepared for the years ahead by updating legislation related to energy efficiency and internal electricity market rules. Even after our energy supply is mostly supplied by renewable sources, there is no realistic scenario in which Europe’s future will be all-electric — or entirely energy independent.

If we want a shot at achieving our climate goals, we need to embed our energy strategy into every aspect of international diplomacy and foreign relations.

Europe should keep taking the lead in international climate negotiations to ensure that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are truly global.

What does this mean?

First and foremost, Europe should keep taking the lead in international climate negotiations to ensure that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are truly global. Advocating for an ambitious and robust implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement will be crucial — as will leading the discussions on developing the long-term greenhouse-gas reduction strategies that have to be in place under the deal by 2020.

We must also recognize the strategic value of becoming a leader in the production of clean energy technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to batteries and smart network components. The availability and free access to these technologies will be crucial to maintaining the sovereignty and security of European countries so that we are not reliant on third parties.

Cooperating with international partners to create new technologies can be a win-win situation, but we can’t afford to be naïve. We have to insist on fair access to markets and maintain control over key assets, including an increasingly digitalized electricity grid. This is crucial to our energy security — and therefore to our security more broadly.

To achieve this goal, we should continue to develop tools to screen foreign investment in certain well-defined strategic sectors. China is already a leader in the manufacturing of solar panels and electric cars, and is poised to dominate the global production of battery cells, for example. We must ensure that there is a level playing field on which our companies can compete.

To this end, Europe needs to continue working on reciprocal market access with China and resist forced technology transfers, whereby foreign companies are made to surrender their technology through a joint venture agreement or other regulations. A reformed World Trade Organization will be crucial to both goals.

Technology is not the only sector where Europe should be wary of Chinese dominance. A fair, clean energy transition will also require access to the metals or minerals that are key to the production of new technologies.

In general, these raw materials are far less concentrated geographically compared with fossil fuels, and there is likely to be less of a bottleneck in trying to gain access to them. Still, China’s lead on certain minerals and components, such as magnets used in some wind turbines — 83 percent of global production — or electrolytes employed in batteries — 60 percent — could impact European competitiveness.

To address this, Europe should continue to oppose restrictions in the trade of such materials. We will also have to put sustainability at the heart of our procurement rules for such materials, to set clear standards on how we source them — and, when possible, reuse them.

While preparing for the clean energy transition, we must acknowledge the inconvenient truth that we can’t completely ignore the global trade in fuels, which will continue to play an important role in our international energy relations.

Decarbonizing will require us to use alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biofuels or gas of renewable origin.

Our import dependency for fossil fuels has increased from 46.7 percent in 2000 to 53.6 percent in 2016, and will continue to rise in the medium term. And thanks to dwindling domestic resources, our import needs for, say, natural gas will decline more slowly than our consumption. We should be careful not to neglect strategic dialogues with our main partners or efforts to diversify our pipeline import infrastructure.

Decarbonizing will require us to use alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biofuels or gas of renewable origin. If we want to scale up these solutions and make sure they are in line with our climate goals, we will have to set the groundwork early on and ensure the countries that produce these renewable fuels are doing so in a sustainable fashion.

Finally, the EU’s efforts to promote global access to clean energy should include a special focus on countries from which people are migrating to Europe, as a means of contributing to a sustainable environment and reducing social and economic tensions. The initiative to electrify Africa will be a key part of this strategy.

If Europe wants to continue to lead on climate, and to make good on its ambitions to be climate neutral by 2050, the next European Commission, together with the newly elected Parliament, has to ensure that energy concerns remain central to our international diplomacy.

While preparing for the clean energy transition, we must acknowledge the inconvenient truth that we can’t completely ignore the global trade in fuels, which will continue to play an important role in our international energy relations.

Decarbonizing will require us to use alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biofuels or gas of renewable origin.

Our import dependency for fossil fuels has increased from 46.7 percent in 2000 to 53.6 percent in 2016, and will continue to rise in the medium term. And thanks to dwindling domestic resources, our import needs for, say, natural gas will decline more slowly than our consumption. We should be careful not to neglect strategic dialogues with our main partners or efforts to diversify our pipeline import infrastructure.

Decarbonizing will require us to use alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biofuels or gas of renewable origin. If we want to scale up these solutions and make sure they are in line with our climate goals, we will have to set the groundwork early on and ensure the countries that produce these renewable fuels are doing so in a sustainable fashion.

Finally, the EU’s efforts to promote global access to clean energy should include a special focus on countries from which people are migrating to Europe, as a means of contributing to a sustainable environment and reducing social and economic tensions. The initiative to electrify Africa will be a key part of this strategy.

If Europe wants to continue to lead on climate, and to make good on its ambitions to be climate neutral by 2050, the next European Commission, together with the newly elected Parliament, has to ensure that energy concerns remain central to our international diplomacy.

336,Europe’s new energy dependency,Pkee,"Combatting climate change is, by definition, a global task.

Europe has shown it’s ready to take a leading role in this fight: Legislation proposed by the European Commission and making its way through the EU institutional process sets out how the bloc can become the world’s first economy to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

But we can’t go it alone: Decarbonizing the Continent won’t lessen our dependence on the rest of the world.

The Commission has prepared for the years ahead by updating legislation related to energy efficiency and internal electricity market rules. Even after our energy supply is mostly supplied by renewable sources, there is no realistic scenario in which Europe’s future will be all-electric — or entirely energy independent.

If we want a shot at achieving our climate goals, we need to embed our energy strategy into every aspect of international diplomacy and foreign relations.

Europe should keep taking the lead in international climate negotiations to ensure that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are truly global.

What does this mean?

First and foremost, Europe should keep taking the lead in international climate negotiations to ensure that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are truly global. Advocating for an ambitious and robust implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement will be crucial — as will leading the discussions on developing the long-term greenhouse-gas reduction strategies that have to be in place under the deal by 2020.

We must also recognize the strategic value of becoming a leader in the production of clean energy technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to batteries and smart network components. The availability and free access to these technologies will be crucial to maintaining the sovereignty and security of European countries so that we are not reliant on third parties.

Cooperating with international partners to create new technologies can be a win-win situation, but we can’t afford to be naïve. We have to insist on fair access to markets and maintain control over key assets, including an increasingly digitalized electricity grid. This is crucial to our energy security — and therefore to our security more broadly.

To achieve this goal, we should continue to develop tools to screen foreign investment in certain well-defined strategic sectors. China is already a leader in the manufacturing of solar panels and electric cars, and is poised to dominate the global production of battery cells, for example. We must ensure that there is a level playing field on which our companies can compete.

To this end, Europe needs to continue working on reciprocal market access with China and resist forced technology transfers, whereby foreign companies are made to surrender their technology through a joint venture agreement or other regulations. A reformed World Trade Organization will be crucial to both goals.

Technology is not the only sector where Europe should be wary of Chinese dominance. A fair, clean energy transition will also require access to the metals or minerals that are key to the production of new technologies.

In general, these raw materials are far less concentrated geographically compared with fossil fuels, and there is likely to be less of a bottleneck in trying to gain access to them. Still, China’s lead on certain minerals and components, such as magnets used in some wind turbines — 83 percent of global production — or electrolytes employed in batteries — 60 percent — could impact European competitiveness.

To address this, Europe should continue to oppose restrictions in the trade of such materials. We will also have to put sustainability at the heart of our procurement rules for such materials, to set clear standards on how we source them — and, when possible, reuse them.

337,Danish Social Democrats win national election,Charlie Duxbury,"Denmark’s Social Democrats are in pole position to form a new government after winning Wednesday's election, with results suggesting the party’s tougher stance on immigration attracted voters back from the far right.

With all votes counted, official results show the Social Democrats secured 26 percent of the vote, which would earn them 48 of the 179 seats in parliament. This put them ahead of the Liberal Party of current Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on 23 percent of the vote, or 43 seats.

Parties supporting Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen to be the next prime minister together secured 91 seats, versus 75 seats for the right of center “blue bloc” supporting Rasmussen, paving the way for Frederiksen to get the first shot at forming a government.

The remaining seats went to unaligned parties.

Frederiksen claimed victory in a speech to supporters in Copenhagen.

“Thank you to the Danish voters, you have voted for a new direction for Denmark and a new government,” she said.

Wednesday’s victory followed a change in the Social Democrats' strategy under Frederiksen, who took over as leader shortly after an election defeat for the party in 2015.

Frederiksen maintained her party’s commitment to high taxation and public spending, but she repositioned the Social Democrats much further to the right on the issue of immigration.

As the main opposition party under Rasmussen, the Social Democrats backed a range of much tougher border controls proposed by the Liberal Party government and its ally, the far-right Danish People’s Party, including the confiscation of valuables from asylum seekers, intended to offset costs to the state for their time in Denmark.

The Social Democrats believed the new strategy could help them reconnect with disaffected former supporters who had shifted to the Danish People’s Party.

As she cast her vote in the town of Værløse, just outside Copenhagen, earlier on Wednesday, Frederiksen said she thought the party’s change of tack had been effective.

“Danes are responding positively to the Social Democrats,” she said. “Voters who have deserted us over recent years, who thought our immigration policy was wrong, have come back this time, that is what many have told me,” she told reporters.

Still, the Social Democrats' hard line on immigration appears to have cost the party support from some voters who objected to the new position, but the results also suggested those voters may have moved to the Social Democrats’ allies on the left: Support for the left-leaning Socialist People’s Party and the Social Liberal Party rose in Wednesday’s election.

Meanwhile, support for the Danish People's Party more than halved to around 9 percent from around 20 percent in 2015.

“This hurts, we must look at what we did wrong and what we can learn,” Danish People’s Party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl said as the results came in.

The Social Democrats will now try to form a single-party minority government with the support of the Social Liberal Party, the Red-Green Alliance and the Socialist People’s Party.

Negotiations over the formation of a new government could take time as these parties are some distance apart on a range of key issues, including immigration and fiscal policy.

The Danish election was also closely watched for what it might mean for Margrethe Vestager, the Danish European competition commissioner, who is a member of the Social Liberal Party and is gunning for the position of Commission president after Jean-Claude Juncker.

To continue to compete for the top job, Vestager must secure the backing of the new government in Copenhagen. The Social Democrat victory leaves this an open question, as the party has so far refused to offer an opinion on who should be Denmark's choice for a Commission position.

“We should let the electorate decide who should form a government at the election on Wednesday and after that, we will decide on the issue of the Danish commissioner,” senior Social Democrat lawmaker Nicolai Wammen said earlier this week.

The Social Democrats might back Vestager as Denmark's Commission nominee in an effort to secure the support of her Social Liberal Party for its government platform, analysts have said.

But on stage in Copenhagen, Social Democrat leader Frederiksen’s focus was on national politics.

“I am proud of the positive campaign we have run,"" she said. ""Now it is over and it is a time to find solutions. Now we have a chance to set a new direction for Denmark.""","“Thank you to the Danish voters, you have voted for a new direction for Denmark and a new government,” she said.

338,"EU conservatives see path to power, pressurizing Macron and Liberals",David M. Herszenhorn,"The center-right politicians who have long ruled in Brussels now see a clear path to holding onto power — turning the fight over the EU's top jobs into a two-person contest: German Chancellor Angela Merkel vs. French President Emmanuel Macron.

And they expect Merkel to win, of course.

If Macron, who is working with European Liberals to build a new progressive force, proves unwilling to cut a deal that lets the center-right European People's Party (EPP) claim the European Commission presidency, the conservatives are hoping Merkel will help steamroll him and instead form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats and the Greens.

As EPP officials describe it, such a coalition would allow them to claim the Commission presidency, the EU's top job, for Manfred Weber, the EPP candidate, while awarding the Parliament presidency to the Greens, and giving the Social Democrats a choice of either the European Council presidency or the position of high representative for foreign affairs.

If Macron and the Liberals get on board, the Council presidency would go to them. If not, Merkel could be generous and effectively let the French designate the next president of the European Central Bank, or she could teach the upstart Macron a lesson and ice out the Liberals.

For his part, Macron, seeing the same math, has undertaken an aggressive outreach campaign to the Socialists.

Whether the conservatives' theory will fly will become clear in the weeks ahead. According to the EU's new parliamentary math, at least the numbers would add up.

The EPP is set to control 179 seats; the Social Democrats 152 seats and the Greens 74 seats, for a total of 405 — comfortably above the 376 needed to form a majority. Macron's new liberal-progressive group, which has yet to choose a name for itself, is set to hold 109 seats.

Weber, who is trying to sell his grand plan for the EU's future leadership to the other groups, made clear at a news conference on Wednesday that he views the Greens as deserving of a prize given their strong election gains, and he specifically offered to take up issues important to them in inviting them to join his majority coalition.

""The EPP is simply ready to immediately start with a very compromise-oriented style,"" Weber said. ""We see that, for example, the Green Party celebrated a success in the election.

""That's why the environmental issues, climate change issues, must be included, and the EPP is ready to talk with the Greens about these issues,"" Weber said. ""And I hope ALDE and the Socialists will also be ready now to talk with us.""

But to get to a vote in Parliament on the next Commission president, Weber would first have to be nominated by the European Council, where currently the numbers are stacked against the conservatives.

Six EU leaders, appointed as coordinators for their pan-European parties within the Council, will meet in Brussels on Friday night to begin their deliberations over candidates for the bloc's top jobs.

The conservatives are betting that the Socialist coordinators, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa, will recognize that the only way they can secure a big prize is by backing an EPP-led coalition.

But bulldozing the president of France may prove impossible. Having the support of Germany and France, the EU's largest countries, is generally seen as essential for any incoming Commission chief. While Merkel and then-British Prime Minister David Cameron initially opposed Jean-Claude Juncker for Commission president in 2014, it is unclear that he could have won had Merkel not ultimately come around.

For his part, Macron, seeing the same math, has undertaken an aggressive outreach campaign to the Socialists in hopes of isolating the EPP in exactly the way the conservatives aim to isolate him.

With Merkel's governing coalition currently in a precarious position in Berlin, it's unclear just how much political strength she will be able to bring to Brussels in support of the EPP. Merkel remains the EU's most influential national leader, but she has declared that this is her last term and already relinquished leadership of her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). If her coalition collapses, she could face retirement sooner than expected.

Leadership fights

Even before the Council makes its nomination, however, the EPP may have to wait for the other political families to sort out their own internal leadership fights in the Parliament.

Those internal contests are now the main focus of attention in the legislature. While the EPP on Wednesday quickly reelected Weber as leader of its parliamentary group, the new group including the Liberals and Macron's centrists will not pick a leader until June 19. Meanwhile, several Social Democrats are maneuvering to oust the group's current German leader, Udo Bullmann, in a vote scheduled for June 18.

Among the front-runners to replace Bullmann is Iratxe García, an MEP for the Spanish Socialists from the Basque region. García told POLITICO it is too soon to predict how the leadership puzzle would be solved, but said that pro-EU groups were intent on maintaining control of the legislature.

If Weber is blocked, the Socialist nominee, Frans Timmermans, is likely to be torpedoed in retaliation by the conservatives.

“What we’re clear about is that we’re going to draw a red line against Euroskeptic and far-right political forces in the Parliament,” García said.

Asked if she would run for group leader of the Socialists, García said: “We’re evaluating and assessing different options, although there’s nothing decided yet.""

In some cases, the individual aspirations of key figures now conflict with the objectives of their party.

Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group, is widely known to covet the job of Parliament president. But putting him in that post would undercut the chances of another Liberal candidate, such as European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, from becoming Commission president.

Macron mystery

Macron has made clear that he wants to block Weber, but it's not clear who he ultimately wants to become Commission president.

One frequently mentioned conservative alternative to Weber is the EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. Because Barnier is French, it would be difficult for Macron to vote against him. But Élysée Palace officials have sent signals recently that Macron considers Barnier part of an old generation of EU leaders that needs to be replaced.

If Weber is blocked, the Socialist nominee, Frans Timmermans, is likely to be torpedoed in retaliation by the conservatives, leaving the field wide open.

Another urgent question is what the Greens, who stand to control 74 seats in Parliament, will demand in exchange for joining a coalition in the legislature, given their votes are absolutely crucial to forming a pro-EU majority that doesn't include both the conservatives and the liberals. At a meeting Wednesday evening of party group leaders, the Greens pushed for drawing up a substantive policy platform and urged the creation of working groups to focus on specific policy areas. It's not expected to be an easy or quick process.

“We are walking on eggs,” said one Green official. “Some groups are yet to be formed.”

The Greens, this politician said, would be adamant in demanding “one or several” green Commissioners — a request that will require help from one or more national capitals.

The politician said he has “mixed feelings” about the ability of the four pro-EU groups to find common ground. The politician questioned how committed the others would be to environmental causes.

“From one side, we have declarations of faith in the three other groups that they stand for defending the environment,” he said. “On the other side, I believe the reaction risks being 'those Greens, they are expensive.'”

However, the leaders of the four main pro-EU groups issued a statement after their meeting declaring they agreed to work together to define ""a common ambition for the next legislative period,"" which would be a platform for the next Commission president. They aim to have drawn up the program by the time EU leaders meet to discuss the top jobs on June 20 and 21.

With both Liberals and Greens having made gains in the election, an agreement on a common policy program between three or four groups could prove extremely difficult, though some officials said they detected a greater willingness for compromise.

So far, the conservatives are demonstrating the cohesion and discipline that has helped them control the top EU jobs for decades.

They reelected Weber overwhelmingly on Wednesday, if only temporarily because they hope he will be elevated to Commission president. The vote, however, also brought some attention Weber could have done without as it highlighted that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party — although suspended from the EPP alliance of parties — remains active in the parliamentary group and voted in support of Weber.

The EPP group also elected vice presidents who are expected to vie for top jobs. Esteban González Pons, a Spaniard, is among the contenders to lead the group if Weber steps aside. González Pons, a vice chair of the EPP and a former spokesperson of the Popular Party in the Spanish senate, has been an MEP since 2014.

Esther de Lange, a Dutch MEP, is also said to covet the group leader post, while Mairead McGuinness, an Irish MEP, is regarded as a potential candidate for Parliament president.

The complexity of the early negotiations offers a preview of just how difficult it will be to manage the new Parliament, in which the traditional center-left and center-right parties have lost scores of seats compared with five years ago, and far-right, nationalist and populist forces have gained substantial ground and will control some 200 seats, though they are divided among multiple groups.

Weber, at his news conference, insisted the EPP is the party prepared to lead the way. ""We are united,"" he said. ""We have a good plan. We are ready for negotiations. We are ready for compromise. And that is our offer.""

340,Farage ally’s one-woman show canceled after gay therapy remark,Galaxy Henry,"Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe attends a post-European elections press conference in London on May 27, 2019 | Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images Farage ally’s one-woman show canceled after gay therapy remark Brexit Party MEP says that ruling out a scientific method to change sexuality is ‘denying’ help to be people who are ‘confused’ or ‘discontented.’

A one-woman live show by Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe was canceled after ""vile"" comments that appeared to endorse gay conversion therapy.

Widdecombe, who has made a political comeback after being elected as a Brexit Party MEP for the South West of England in last month's European election, was expected to perform at in Ilfracombe, Devon, in March next year. Her show — ""Strictly Ann: An Evening With Ann Widdecombe"" — at the Landmark theater was axed by the Selladoor theater company when the MEP suggested that science could ""produce an answer"" to homosexuality in the future.

""I've never claimed that such science already exists,"" she told Sky's Sophy Ridge program on Sunday, ""I've merely said that if you simply rule out the possibility of it, you're denying people who are confused about their sexuality, or discontented with it, the chances that you do give to people who want to change gender.""

David Hutchinson, Selladoor's CEO, tweeted: ""Absolutely disgusted at Ann Widdecombe's comments over the weekend. Took no time in immediately cancelling her planned 'evening with' at one of our @SelladoorVenues.""

He added, ""We will never provide a stage for these vile people.""

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage backed Widdecombe's remarks on Tuesday. Appearing on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain,"" he described the issue as a ""matter of conscience."" Widdecombe has not responded publicly to the controversy surrounding her remarks.

LGBT charity Stonewall describes conversion therapy as a pseudoscientific practice that aims to change a person's sexual orientation. It is founded on the premise that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual is a curable mental illness.","Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe attends a post-European elections press conference in London on May 27, 2019 | Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images Farage ally’s one-woman show canceled after gay therapy remark Brexit Party MEP says that ruling out a scientific method to change sexuality is ‘denying’ help to be people who are ‘confused’ or ‘discontented.’A one-woman live show by Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe was canceled after ""vile"" comments that appeared to endorse gay conversion therapy.

341,Germany’s military maneuvers,John Vinocur,"Germany is considering a break from decades of military non-confrontation.

High ranking officials are contemplating sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait — joining the United States and France in challenging Beijing’s claims to what the West regards as an international waterway.

If Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government actually goes ahead, it will be a remarkable revision of its we-keep-out-of-conflict reflexes. Germany will be openly backing its allies in a strategy certain to be found provocative by the country’s enforcers of non-combatant passivity.

Recent examples of Germany’s reluctance to engage include the withdrawal of its navy from the combat zone during the West’s Libyan intervention in 2011, caveats on its troop deployments in Afghanistan, and its decision not to participate directly in attacks on Islamic State forces in Syria — unlike its NATO neighbors Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France.

A German official informed me of the Taiwan Strait plan last month. Last week, a second German official, at my request, confirmed its discussion by the defense ministry. No firm decision was expected before the end of the summer.

There are German officials who want to combat the notion that the country is an irresponsible and non-committal ally.

The strait in question is the body of water between China and Taiwan, which Beijing considers to be its territorial zone. When a French frigate transited in April, it was shadowed by Chinese military and warned to leave. Beijing said it made “stern representations” to Paris about the vessel’s “illegal” passage.

Later that month, the United States sent two destroyers into the strait “demonstrating the U.S.’s commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” according to an American spokesman.

The U.S. has prioritized countering China’s military rise since the early days of Barack Obama’s presidency. France, for its part, has seized every possibility to underscore its identity as a global, nuclear-armed interventionist and potential American wingman.

Why would Germany get involved? Some elements in Merkel’s government see a double opportunity, given Berlin’s lousy relations with U.S. President Donald Trump and wide disrespect elsewhere for its hide-under-the-bed routine.

It certainly wouldn’t hurt to back up the U.S. at a time when Washington has suspended threats of tariffs for six months on imported German cars. The naval mission would also be an opportunity to show up France, which likes to portray itself as the European Union’s sole functional military power and which has responded to Merkel’s opposition to most of President Emmanuel Macron’s reform proposals for the EU by becoming one of Germany’s sharpest critics.

France has just spent two years and €1.3 billion to refurbish its atomic-powered carrier, the Charles de Gaulle. French generals have accused Berlin of running a “non-combat” army. Macron himself has said that Germany’s growth model, based on profiting from imbalances in the eurozone, is at an end.

His openness has emboldened French commentators to pick up the now authorized lash. Zaki Laidi, a professor at Sciences Po, the French political science university, wrote last month that Merkel ‘’has done absolutely nothing’’ to change Germany’s role as a rich global bystander protected by America.

The question now is whether the government, faced with deepening political weakness at home, will challenge that portrayal and actually follow through with the plan for projecting power.

The signs aren’t overwhelmingly promising. Merkel’s apparent valedictory speech at the Harvard University commencement a week ago was a time warp moment — a pretend flashback to a time when Germany was the uncontested European leader, bathing in cash, moderation and the overdrawn favor of Obama.

In reality, Germany is politically riven to the edge of instability. Its economic prospects are dim. Merkel’s paralytic coalition with the Social Democrats has “cave-in” scrawled all over it two years before she is scheduled to leave office in 2021.

Polls over the weekend measured the depth of Germany’s cracks. For the first time since the Green Party became a player in the early 1980s, the environmentalist movement surpassed Merkel’s Christian Democrats in a projection of national election results. The Social Democrats sank to a historical low, just a point ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany.

Economically, what Merkel once called Germany’s “Beacon to the World” keeps flashing dimmer shades of yellow. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry reports that gross domestic product growth will fall to 0.6 percent this year, with little prospect for improvement in 2020.

Worse still: The chancellor’s chosen successor, CDU party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is failing in her job preparation. A poll last week showed that 70 percent of the Germans think she is not up to the task.

Among her ideas: a ""symbolic project’’ for Germany and France to jointly build an aircraft carrier to demonstrate the EU’s role as a ‘’security and peace power’’ — without detailing its mission. Forced to deal with her protégé’s fantasy, while refusing herself to meet NATO’s spending targets, Merkel has been cornered into saying ‘’it’s right and good.’’

In this context, launching a naval in-your-face operation off the coast of Taiwan would constitute a groundbreaking but unfamiliar act of valor.

Admirably, there are German officials who want to combat the notion that the country is an irresponsible and non-committal ally. More power to them. The place to do that is the international waters of the Taiwan Strait. Now, the German navy needs to get that far.

Nigel Farage will ""not join"" the Europe of Nations and Freedoms group in the European Parliament, which contains the party of Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, he told POLITICO in a statement.

The Brexit Party leader has been considering his options in the new Parliament after his Brexit Party won the European election in the U.K. with 29 seats. Last week, he met Marco Zanni, a member of Salvini's League party, to see whether an alliance between the Italian and British parties was possible.

The ENF exists in its current form until the end of June, but when the new Parliament formally takes its seats it will have a much larger contingent of League MEPs — Salvini's party won 26 in the European election.

""Following a brief social meeting with a member of the ENF Group [Salvini's group] last week there has been much speculation, fuelled by that individual, that the Brexit Party will join them in their European Parliament group,"" Farage's statement said.

""I can confirm that this is not the case and that the Brexit Party will not be joining the ENF Group,"" he added.

His spokesperson said Farage, who is still the leader of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy ""will plan to rebuild the EFDD."" That group was formed primarily of his former UKIP party (which won no seats in the election), as well as the Italian 5Star Movement. But the group has lost MEPs, including from the French Les Patriotes party and it is unclear whether it will hold together.

Joining with other parties to form a group in the European Parliament gives access to EU funds and influence via committee posts.

The European People's Party on Wednesday reelected Manfred Weber as leader of its group in the European Parliament but the German also remains its nominee for the European Commission presidency.

The center-right group, the largest bloc in the Parliament, overwhelmingly backed Weber, ""demonstrating our Members' trust in his leadership and unity within our Group,"" the EPP said in a tweet. The Bavarian secured 156 out of 160 votes cast. He faced no opposing candidates.

Weber hopes to move on to the Commission presidency later this year, although his chances of securing the post are highly uncertain, with a range of EU member countries including France ranged against him. Weber could, however, also end up with another senior post, such as Germany's European commissioner or president of the Parliament.

The EPP group also reelected current vice chairs, including MEP Esteban González Pons from Spain and Esther de Lange from the Netherlands. If Weber moves on, Gonzales Pons and de Lange have long been seen as leading candidates to replace him at the top of the group.

Pilar del Castillo, an MEP for Spain's Popular Party (PP) and former minister, told POLITICO her party will propose González Pons as Weber's successor if the German moves on to another post.

""We want Esteban González Pons to be our president, he will be our candidate to become president of the EPP, replacing Manfred Weber ... if there's that option,"" Del Castillo said.

Germany's CDU/CSU alliance is by far the largest force in the EPP bloc but some group members have made clear they think it should be the turn of a non-German to have the leading role.

González Pons, a former spokesperson for the Popular Party in the Spanish senate, has been an MEP since 2004.

With 12 seats in the new Parliament, his party is the fifth largest delegation in the EPP group, behind the German, Polish, Romanian and Hungarian delegations.

347,Farage rejects European Parliament summons over undisclosed gifts,Maïa De La Baume,"MEP and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage | Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images Farage rejects European Parliament summons over undisclosed gifts Brexit Party leader says he won’t appear before ‘EU kangaroo court.’

Nigel Farage rejected a European Parliament committee request to appear in Brussels within 24 hours to testify about allegations that he failed to disclose gifts worth £450,000 from a British businessman.

Farage, an MEP and leader of the Brexit Party, said he received a letter at 2:45 p.m. Tuesday from the Parliament's advisory committee on the conduct of MEPs, requesting that he testify in Brussels within a day's time.

“What is this but an EU kangaroo court where I am given 24 hours' notice about allegations picked up from press stories,"" Farage said in a statement, denying any wrongdoing.

""I did not receive any private money for political purposes,"" Farage said.

Last month, the Parliament opened an investigation into Farage after the U.K.'s Channel 4 News reported that the British politician had failed to declare gifts worth £450,000 from insurance tycoon Arron Banks, a co-founder of the Brexit campaign group Leave.EU. OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud agency, is also in the process of determining whether to open a formal investigation into the allegations.

Under Parliament rules, members have to declare gifts they have received ""when representing Parliament in an official capacity,"" and ""such gifts are reported in the register of gifts."" Banks' support for Farage reportedly included a car with a driver, trips to the United States and a lavish home in London's upscale Chelsea neighborhood.

A Parliament spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations against Farage, saying the advisory committee's decisions are not made public.

The committee can make recommendations to the Parliament president regarding whether an MEP has violated the code of conduct.

Farage's Brexit Party was the clear winner of the European election in the U.K. and is set to fill 29 seats in the next Parliament.

348,Farage rejects European Parliament summons over undisclosed gifts,Tom Mctague,"MEP and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage | Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images Farage rejects European Parliament summons over undisclosed gifts Brexit Party leader says he won’t appear before ‘EU kangaroo court.’

Nigel Farage rejected a European Parliament committee request to appear in Brussels within 24 hours to testify about allegations that he failed to disclose gifts worth £450,000 from a British businessman.

Farage, an MEP and leader of the Brexit Party, said he received a letter at 2:45 p.m. Tuesday from the Parliament's advisory committee on the conduct of MEPs, requesting that he testify in Brussels within a day's time.

“What is this but an EU kangaroo court where I am given 24 hours' notice about allegations picked up from press stories,"" Farage said in a statement, denying any wrongdoing.

""I did not receive any private money for political purposes,"" Farage said.

Last month, the Parliament opened an investigation into Farage after the U.K.'s Channel 4 News reported that the British politician had failed to declare gifts worth £450,000 from insurance tycoon Arron Banks, a co-founder of the Brexit campaign group Leave.EU. OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud agency, is also in the process of determining whether to open a formal investigation into the allegations.

Under Parliament rules, members have to declare gifts they have received ""when representing Parliament in an official capacity,"" and ""such gifts are reported in the register of gifts."" Banks' support for Farage reportedly included a car with a driver, trips to the United States and a lavish home in London's upscale Chelsea neighborhood.

A Parliament spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations against Farage, saying the advisory committee's decisions are not made public.

The committee can make recommendations to the Parliament president regarding whether an MEP has violated the code of conduct.

349,Macron emerges from popularity slump,Rym Momtaz,"French President Emmanuel Macron | Christophe Petit Tesson/AFP via Getty Images Macron emerges from popularity slump French president’s approval rating has returned to levels last seen 9 months ago.

PARIS — Emmanuel Macron has staged a comeback.

The French president's approval rating reached 40 percent in May according to a poll by Harris Interactive, returning to levels last seen before the start of a turbulent nine-month period.

Macron's problems started in July last year when he faced criticism after one of his bodyguards was filmed beating protesters on May Day and were exacerbated by the resignation of a popular environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, who complained of a lack of commitment to environmental policy in the government. The crisis reached boiling point in the fall with the anti-government Yellow Jackets movement holding weekly protests.

But Macron seems to have turned the corner after a series of spending measures and a listening tour designed to soften his image and make him seem less disconnected from average people. His prime minister, Edouard Philippe, has seen a similar recovery in approval ratings.

An official close to Philippe cautioned that polls tend to fluctuate, but attributed the rise to the government having ""corrected course on some issues,"" by performing a U-turn on a tax on pensions and implementing measures to boost the purchasing power of the less well-off in response to the Yellow Jacket crisis.

Such policy changes seem to resonate with left-wing voters in particular. This month's numbers show a sizeable improvement in Macron and Philippe's ratings among supporters of the Socialist Party, with both gaining 19 points compared with April.

Yet when it came to expressing a preference at the ballot box in the European Parliament election last month, only 15 percent of Socialist Party supporters voted for Macron's Renaissance list, according to a poll by Ipsos/Sopra. The majority of support for Renaissance came from the center and center right.","French President Emmanuel Macron | Christophe Petit Tesson/AFP via Getty Images Macron emerges from popularity slump French president’s approval rating has returned to levels last seen 9 months ago.

350,Polls show Danish center left set to oust government,Ryan Heath,"Polls show Danish center left set to oust government Social Democrats have been biggest party all year.

Denmark’s general election Wednesday is likely to produce a change of government, according to POLITICO’s poll of polls.

The highest-polling party, the Social Democrats, currently averages 27 percent support, leading the second-placed Liberals by an average of 8 points.

Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen has said she aims to lead a left-wing minority administration but no party will be able to form a government without at least some support from others.

Across dozens polls in the course of 2019, the country’s progressive ""red bloc"" of parties has increased its lead over the more conservative “blue bloc,” which currently governs the country under Liberal Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen.

Red-bloc parties, which include the Social Democrats, Radical Liberals, Red-Green Alliance and Socialist People's Party, have a 12-point lead (55 to 43) over the blue bloc. The trailing alliance is headed by the Liberal party and includes the Euroskeptic Danish People's Party and Christian Democrats.

While the red bloc’s overall lead looks unassailable, the Social Democrats slipped in a poll conducted on May 26, the day of the European Parliament election, scoring 23 percent, giving them just a 3-point lead over the Liberals.

The Social Democrats won only 21 percent of the vote in the European Parliament election, well below their national opinion poll rating, and were beaten into second place by the Liberals by 2 points.

In Denmark’s 2015 election, the blue bloc beat the red bloc by 52 to 47 percent.","Polls show Danish center left set to oust government Social Democrats have been biggest party all year.

LONDON — Donald Trump refused to meet Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday — dismissing the U.K. Labour leader as a ""negative force.""

The U.S. president, speaking alongside U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May at a joint press conference at the Foreign Office, attacked Corbyn's decision to attend a protest rally against his state visit. Trump also once again attacked London Mayor Sadiq Khan, accusing him of doing a bad job.

""I don't know Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said. ""He wanted to meet today. I said no. He is somewhat of a negative force. I have decided not to meet.""

A Labour spokesperson said: “Jeremy Corbyn proposed a meeting with Donald Trump during the president’s visit. Jeremy is ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis.”

Earlier, the Labour leader had addressed crowds of protesters. He said the basis for debate should not be “how we go forward with no deal at the same time as offering up, offering up our precious, wonderful National Health Service to private American companies to come in and take it over.”

“Dear Mr President. The NHS isn’t on the table in trade talks — and never will be. Not on my watch"" — Matt Hancock, U.K. health secretary

“We will not stand for that,” he said. “We will fight with every last breath of our body to defend the principle, for the principle of a health service free at the point of need to everybody as a human right.”

Trump confirmed in his remarks that there would be no limits to the potential scope of a post-Brexit trade deal — including the NHS. “When you are dealing with trade everything is on the table, so NHS or anything else… but everything will be on the table, absolutely,” he said.

May sought to gloss over the issue — a political live-wire in the U.K., where the NHS is held in highest regard by the public — saying that in all trade talks “both sides negotiate and come to agreement about what should and should not be in that trade deal.”

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, later tweeted: “Dear Mr President. The NHS isn’t on the table in trade talks — and never will be. Not on my watch.”

In answers to questions from reporters, Trump paid tribute to the outgoing British prime minister, saying she is a ""great professional"" who loves her country and has ""teed up"" a Brexit deal. ""Perhaps you won't get the credit you deserve, but you deserve a lot of credit,"" he said.

The two leaders discussed their opposing positions on the Iran nuclear deal, May said that she raised climate change with the president, and prospects for a post-Brexit trade deal were also on the agenda, though with the U.K. still an EU member the talks have not been substantive.

Trump also strayed into a light-hearted comment on the race to succeed May. Having spoken to early front-runner Boris Johnson on the phone during his visit, Trump repeated his admiration for the former foreign secretary, but also acknowledged the current post-holder Jeremy Hunt, who was sitting in front of him.

“I know Jeremy, I think he’d do a very good job,” Trump said, before adding that he did not know Environment Secretary Michael Gove (even though Gove had interviewed the president in January 2017, shortly after his election.) “Would he do a good job Jeremy? Tell me,” he joked, addressing Hunt.

On Huawei, a potential flashpoint of the trip following reports of the U.K.’s openness to allowing the Chinese telecoms firm to access its 5G network, Trump insisted the issue would have no bearing on intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and the U.K.

“We will be able to work out any differences,” Trump said, acknowledging that the delegations had discussed the matter but that he foresees “absolutely no limitations” on intelligence-sharing. “This is a truly great ally and partner and we’ll have no problems with that,” he said.","U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May at a press conference in London | Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Donald Trump refused to meet ‘negative’ Jeremy Corbyn Labour leader addressed anti-Trump protest rally.

358,"Trump to departing Theresa May: ‘Stick around, let’s do this deal’",Caitlin Oprysko,"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a business roundtable discussion at St. James' Palace in London on June 4, 2019 | Tim Ireland/AFP via Getty Images Trump to departing Theresa May: ‘Stick around, let’s do this deal’ President predicts a ‘very, very substantial trade deal’ between the US and UK

President Donald Trump on Tuesday prodded outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, who will resign as her party's leader at the end of this week, to ""stick around"" until the two leaders can strike a deal on trade.

At the top of a meeting on Tuesday in London with American and British business leaders, Trump praised May, who will step aside on Friday from Conservative Party leadership but will remain prime minister until her successor is elected.

Trump predicted a “very, very substantial trade deal” between the U.S. and U.K., apparently trying to cajole May into staying put.

“It’s an honor to have worked with you, and I don’t know exactly what your timing is but stick around, let’s do this deal,” Trump told May, eliciting chuckles around the room.

While Trump said his administration would be in talks about a potential free-trade deal throughout his visit to the U.K. and into the next few weeks, it is unclear if Tuesday’s meetings yielded any progress on that front, given May’s lame-duck status and Britain’s so far unsuccessful attempts to withdraw from the European Union. Any free-trade deal between London and Washington can only be negotiated and go into effect following Brexit, which is currently delayed until at least the end of October as the British government works to stabilize following May’s resignation.

May, for her part, called for a “wider economic partnership” between the U.S. and the U.K., as well as ""free and fair"" trade markets for the two countries.

“It will be a very fair deal and I think that this is something that your folks want to do, my folks want to do, and we want to do and we're going to get it done,” Trump added of a potential agreement.

The two leaders will have bilateral meetings and lunch throughout the day Tuesday, followed by a press conference with Trump and May before the president departs for France, where he will participate in D-Day anniversary ceremonies.

So far Tuesday, Trump has avoided the griping that marked the beginning of his first day in the U.K., in which he lashed out at London Mayor and Trump critic Sadiq Khan, referred to the EU as ""shackles"" on the U.K. and suggested the boycott of AT&T in order to force better news coverage by CNN, which is owned by the telecommunications giant.","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a business roundtable discussion at St. James' Palace in London on June 4, 2019 | Tim Ireland/AFP via Getty Images Trump to departing Theresa May: ‘Stick around, let’s do this deal’ President predicts a ‘very, very substantial trade deal’ between the US and UKPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday prodded outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, who will resign as her party's leader at the end of this week, to ""stick around"" until the two leaders can strike a deal on trade.

359,Danish left set for immigrant pushback payoff,Charlie Duxbury,"COPENHAGEN — Denmark’s Social Democrats are in pole position to take power in Wednesday’s general election after adopting a much tougher stance on one of the campaign’s key issues: immigration.

Surveys captured in POLITICO's poll of polls put the party first with around 26 percent support, ahead of the Liberal Party of current Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen with around 20 percent support.

The bloc of parties backing the Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen to be the next prime minister is about 10 percentage points clear of the bloc backing Rasmussen to continue.

After they lost the 2015 election to Rasmussen and his allies in the far-right anti-immigration Danish People’s Party, the Social Democrats continued to position themselves as guarantors of Denmark’s extensive welfare state, advocating high taxes and high state spending on public services.

At the same time, the party moved sharply toward the DPP on immigration policy, signing off on several government initiatives to tighten border controls.

“We recognize that Denmark has a responsibility to assist people in need, but we are also aware that there are limits to how many people we can receive"" — Nicolai Wammen, senior Danish Social Democrat

The Social Democrats backed a government proposal to confiscate valuables such as jewelry from asylum seekers in order to offset the costs to the state of their stay in Denmark. It also backed a move to stop refugees arriving in the country under the U.N.’s quota system.

“We believe that it is very important for Denmark that we continue with a firm and realistic immigration policy,” Nicolai Wammen, a senior Social Democrat lawmaker and former minister, told POLITICO in an interview. “We recognize that Denmark has a responsibility to assist people in need, but we are also aware that there are limits to how many people we can receive, if we are to maintain our welfare state and have an immigration policy that works.”

People's Party squeezed

Overall, the Social Democrats' new stance on immigration appears to be paying off, experts say.

It is costing the party support among voters who object to its new harder line, but those voters are largely moving to its allies: Support for the left-leaning Socialist People’s Party and Red-Green Alliance is up.

Meanwhile, support for the Danish People's Party (Dansk Folkeparti, also called DK or DPP) has halved to around 10 percent from around 20 percent in 2015.

“The Social Democrats are attracting former DPP voters,” said Rune Stubager, a political scientist at Aarhus University. “At the same time, they are losing supporters to the left.""

The Danish People's Party has also been hit by the emergence of two parties, the New Right and the Hard Line (Stram Kurs), which advocate even tighter immigration policies than the DPP.

The DK lost three of its four seats in the European Parliament in May’s election.

On the streets of Copenhagen, Robert Sonne, a 65-year-old musician, said immigration had clearly been central to the campaign.

“The Social Democrats have tightened up their proposals a bit, we’ll have to see if it works,” he said. “It is such a difficult question, it is hard to know what the best way is.”

Posters with the faces of local candidates were plastered all over town. The main local television stations were setting up infrastructure outside the parliament building.

“It is very weird to see,” he said. “It has really changed things, it is not at all what we expected from them"" — Robert Stenbäck, 19-year-old student

Robert Stenbäck, a 19-year-old student, said it has been striking how far to the right the Social Democrats have moved their immigration policy.

“It is very weird to see,” he said. “It has really changed things, it is not at all what we expected from them.”

Stenbäck said he didn’t much like the change and would be voting for The Alternative party, which is further to the left.

Nordic revival

If the Social Democrats win in Wednesday’s election, Frederiksen said she plans to try to form a one-party minority government and seek support from the left and right.

""We are campaigning for a new direction for Denmark. We are therefore campaigning for a new Social Democrat minority government,"" Frederiksen told reporters on Tuesday.

Political scientist Stubager suggested this could be difficult.

“Negotiations are likely to be tough as the left-wing parties are demanding concessions, including on immigration; the process is likely to take several weeks, if not more,” he said.

A Social Democrat win would represent a rare success in Europe for left-of-center parties, which have struggled with waning support in countries such as France, Germany and Italy in recent years.

It would, however, be further evidence that the political left is enjoying something of a revival in its Nordic heartland, even if it remains well short of its former glory.

Left-leaning prime ministers now have the reins in Iceland and Sweden, and won a recent election in Finland. Norway’s Labor Party won the most votes in the last election two years ago, but failed to form a coalition that could take power.

While the polls have been in the Danish Social Democrats’ favor in the run-up to Wednesday, lawmaker Wammen said he still believed it would be a tight result in the end.

The party came in second behind the Liberals in the European election.

U.S. President Donald Trump ""is a sexual predator"" and ""a racist,"" and ""it's right to say that,"" according to U.K. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.

Speaking to the BBC's ""Today"" radio program about Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's decision to boycott Trump's U.K. state visit this week and instead address an anti-Trump protest rally, Thornberry said it is the appropriate response to the American president.

""A state visit is an honor, and we don’t think that this president deserves an honor,"" Thornberry said. ""He is a sexual predator, he is a racist, and it’s right to say that. And I think we need to think about when is it that our country got so scared. Why can’t we start saying things as they are?""

The shadow Cabinet minister said it's time for the U.K. to stand up to Trump.

""We’ve seen the way in which this current British government have tried to deal with Donald Trump, by fawning all over him, holding his hand, and what respect have we got as a result of it?"" she said, adding that ""actually he admires strength.""

She said: ""It’s like the way you deal with a bully. If you bow down in front of them, you get kicked harder.""

Asked why Corbyn refused to attend Trump events but took a different approach during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit, Thornberry said the Labour chief had raised his concerns with the Chinese leader during meetings with him.

She added: ""The reason I think that I personally am so angry at this particular American president, and I admit that I am, is that I love America and I love the values America has stood for … When you have a close friend and they’re going wrong, you are more likely to be more adamant with them, clearer with them, than with someone who has not been as close a friend and you are trying to build a relationship with them.""","Emily Thornberry, U.K. shadow foreign secretary | Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Emily Thornberry: Trump is a ‘sexual predator’ and ‘racist’ ‘A state visit is an honor, and we don’t think that this president deserves an honor,’ says UK shadow foreign secretary.

362,Trump’s royal entourage descends on Britain,Tom Mctague,"“London part of the trip is going really well. The queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong,” Trump wrote on Twitter | Dominic Lipinski/WPA Pool via Getty Images Trump’s royal entourage descends on Britain In addition to his wife and 4 adult children, the president brings along friends like Chris Ruddy, CEO of the conservative media organization Newsmax.

LONDON — President Donald Trump brought his own royal entourage to Britain.

On his first state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump brought his wife and four adult children, but it wasn’t just family that tagged along for the ride. Close friends such as Chris Ruddy, CEO of the conservative media organization Newsmax, made the trip and attended the state banquet Monday night.

The coterie surrounding Trump appeared to provide a buffer throughout the day for the highly anticipated interactions between the unruly American leader and Britain’s well-mannered royal family. The seamless interactions with Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and a host of other British royals stood in contrast with Trump’s pre-arrival Twitter bombast and norm-busting interviews with the British media.

The set up wasn’t an accident. While officials know they can’t stop the Trump tweetstorms — including a heated outburst calling London Mayor Sadiq Khan a “stone cold loser” — they hoped the circle of close friends, family and advisers would at least protect the president’s time with the royals, a former White House official said. First lady Melania Trump reportedly prepared for the trip by studying certain protocols, including walking and speaking directives, to which guests of the queen are meant to adhere in her presence.

“I was glad he defended himself against the London mayor’s attacks, but that’s the kind of stuff you should absolutely leave at the palace door,” the official said.

In addition to Trump’s family and friends, there was also a swollen group of administration officials that accompanied the president. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Social Media Director Dan Scavino, policy adviser Stephen Miller and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife are in Britain.

But even with the safeguard of advisers and family, Trump has bulldozed his way into England. In a series of interviews ahead of his arrival, Trump called Meghan Markle “nasty,” criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May’s handling of Brexit negotiations and stumped for Boris Johnson, a longtime Brexit champion, to replace the outgoing May.

After touching down, though, a more diplomatic Trump took over.

Trump stood stoically beside Queen Elizabeth on the west terrace of Buckingham Palace to watch the Grenadier Guards, in their iconic red tunics and bearskin hats, give a royal salute. He placed his hand over his heart during a performance of the national anthem, inspected the guard of honor with Prince Charles and dutifully followed her majesty back inside once the ceremony concluded.

By late Monday afternoon, Trump was mostly off Twitter and enjoying a customary cup of tea with Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, duchess of Cornwall.

“London part of the trip is going really well. The queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong,” Trump wrote on Twitter in between his meetings and the state dinner at Buckingham Palace.

Though White House officials declined to say whether Trump was briefed on royal protocols ahead of the trip, Judi James, a prominent body language expert in the U.K., told the Daily Telegraph that the president appeared to have studied up since his earlier U.K. trip in July.

“He looked as though he knew what he was doing much more. Last time, there was a degree of awkwardness. This time, he looked much more dignified,” James said.

There are scores of arcane rules for interacting with British royals, said Angela Levin, a royal biographer.

“You never talk to the queen, you wait for her to talk to you first. You don’t go in front of her … and if she stops eating, you have to stop eating too,” she said.

Aides are more anxious about Tuesday's joint news conference by Trump and May, according to an administration official. It’s these bilateral events, rather than the ceremonial gatherings, at which Trump tends to make news.

“It’s actually quite daunting for any president, when you’re sitting at the banquet table near the queen and have six glasses in front of you and masses of cutlery,” Levin added, noting that protocol will play an important role when the Trumps accompany the queen on Wednesday to a D-Day anniversary ceremony in Portsmouth.

A senior White House official suggested that Trump’s adult children, who are along for the visit and attended the state banquet with their spouses, didn’t need etiquette lessons before interacting with the queen: “These are kids with impeccable etiquette to start with, so I wondered if that was even necessary.”

Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser, was the only other member of the first family visibly present during the welcome ceremony at Buckingham Palace. She and her husband, White House adviser Jared Kushner, stood on one of several balconies overlooking the queen’s private garden as the president greeted the queen. They were joined by U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Woody Johnson, as National Security Adviser John Bolton peeked out of a large window to their right. Johnson is set to host a reception for the president, U.K. officials and members of the royal family at his residence Tuesday night.

Aides are more anxious about Tuesday's joint news conference by Trump and May, according to an administration official. It’s these bilateral events, rather than the ceremonial gatherings, at which Trump tends to make news. Indeed, Trump has repeatedly sparked controversy during overseas news conferences.

The president sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin when he claimed during a joint appearance last summer that Kremlin operatives did not meddle in the 2016 presidential election. And at a news conference last month with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump said he agrees with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s criticism of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Trump will also have a three-hour gap on Tuesday between his final bilateral event and his dinner at the ambassador’s home — a rest period that is likely to put White House aides and U.K. officials on edge.

On Monday, once his activities with members of the royal household had concluded, Trump fired off four tweets on a wide range of topics in a two-hour span of downtime.

“Haven’t seen any protests yet, but I’m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them… Also, big Trade Deal is possible once U.K. gets rid of the shackles. Already starting to talk!” he wrote.","LONDON — President Donald Trump brought his own royal entourage to Britain.

364,The wrong man for the ECB,Paul Taylor,"He voted against the decisions that saved the euro. He publicly criticized them while financial markets were in turmoil. He offered no alternatives. And he still believes it’s not the European Central Bank’s job to preserve the eurozone — only to keep prices stable.

Yet some people in Berlin and Frankfurt want to anoint Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank and standard-bearer of German monetary orthodoxy, as successor to Mario Draghi when the Italian ECB president steps down this fall.

The race for the most powerful and sensitive job in the European economy ought to be run strictly on its own merits. But like a rare lunar eclipse, the Bank’s eight-year appointment cycle coincides with the EU’s five-year political and legislative cycle for the first time since it was set up in 1998.

So the ECB nomination has become part of a wider package deal among EU leaders involving the top jobs in the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, as well as the bloc’s next foreign policy chief.

After leaders had a first informal discussion of this mercato last week, European Council President Donald Tusk said he would consult with the Parliament and national governments to try to “provide clarity on all these posts already in June” at the next EU summit. He also spoke of “the need to reflect the diversity of the Union when it comes to geography, the size of countries, gender as well as political affiliation.”

The ECB needs a leader willing to think outside the box and take unconventional action if required in a storm.

Tusk’s statement appeared to subordinate the choice of ECB chief to the outcome of the bigger political power struggle over the Commission presidency, and to the requirements of East-West, North-South, male-female and left-right-center balance. Put simply, if German Chancellor Angela Merkel fails to shoehorn Bavarian conservative Manfred Weber into the top Commission job, due to opposition led by French President Emmanuel Macron, Germany would have to be compensated with another major post.

That’s no way to choose a central bank chief who, in the absence of a central EU government, is the eurozone’s last line of defense against a financial meltdown. It could cost Europe dearly when the next crisis hits, whether due to a global trade war unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump, a chaotic no-deal Brexit, a fiscal explosion in Italy or some less predictable event.

The ECB needs a leader willing to think outside the box and take unconventional action if required in a storm. Weidmann does not have the right mindset for the job. Despite his intellect, multilingual communication skills, government experience and charm, there is no reason in his track record to believe the conservative German would be willing to do (or even say) “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro, as Draghi did in a bold act of statesmanship at the peak of the eurozone crisis in 2012.

Weidmann’s boosters argue that he would be best placed to sell ECB policy to a skeptical German public. But he is too blinkered by dogma about the limits of the central bank’s mandate. He has argued that persistently undershooting the ECB’s inflation target of close to but below 2 percent is not a problem and should not delay a tightening of ultra-loose monetary policy. And he has voiced sympathy with the discontent of German savers who are no longer receiving real interest on their risk-free savings deposits due to low ECB rates.

Draghi’s vow to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, backed by a policy of being ready to buy short-maturity bonds of struggling governments that accepted and implemented an adjustment program, marked the turning point in the eurozone crisis.

Weidmann not only opposed this Outright Monetary Transactions policy, he testified against it in a lawsuit brought by ultra-conservative professors in the German Constitutional Court, arguing that the ECB had no place acting as a lender of last resort to eurozone governments with the risk of losses for German taxpayers. His statement gave ammunition to the ECB’s most virulent German critics, who accuse Draghi of a creeping expropriation of German pensioners to keep Italy afloat with cheap money.

“If Weidmann were to be selected, financial markets might pretty quickly want to test the euro area again,” said Guntram Wolf, director of the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels. “This is all the more likely as we see a very serious political rift between the EU as a whole and Italian politics and the Italian economy.""

Asked last year by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung whether preserving the euro should be a goal of monetary policy, Weidmann said: “The ECB has only one goal, namely to secure price stability.” It is up to politicians, he added, to ensure that member states pursued economic policies that make the currency area sustainable over the long term.

Other central bankers, like Draghi, have interpreted the ECB’s mandate much more broadly. While the EU treaty makes price stability the primary objective, it also stipulates that the bank “shall support the general economic policies in the Union” and promote “the smooth operation of payments systems.”

With interest rates at zero, inflation remaining stubbornly low and the stock of government bonds eligible for purchase nearing exhaustion, the bank has fewer tools left to combat a new downturn if one should occur. It could buy bank bonds or stocks, as the Bank of Japan has done. It could also find ways to directly finance public investment in infrastructure and the transition to green energy in the eurozone, but such controversial steps run counter to conservative German orthodoxy.

There are several well-qualified candidates to lead the ECB through the next eight years.

Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, 60, shares Draghi’s more expansive view of the ECB’s role and argued recently that monetary policy should remain accommodating, just as hawks are itching to “normalize” it. The German-speaking Frenchman, with a distinguished record of private sector and government service, is the first choice of those seeking continuity with the Draghi years. Especially since fellow Frenchman Benoit Coeure, 50, appears to be barred from the job since he is currently serving an eight-year non-renewable term on the ECB’s executive board.

If both Frenchmen were blocked by German opposition, there are two Finns waiting in the wings. Erkki Liikanen was a key asset to Draghi on the ECB’s policymaking governing council as a northern swing voter who supported decisive crisis action. But he will be 69 in October, perhaps late in life to start an eight-year term. One possibility for which there is a precedent is that Liikanen might commit to serving less than a full term and make way for a younger successor.

Olli Rehn, 57, who was the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs at the height of the eurozone crisis and is now governor of the Bank of Finland, has made some thoughtful speeches calling for a Fed-style review of ECB monetary policy in the light of persistent undershooting of the inflation target. However, neither Finn is a gifted communicator.

Whatever the question is for the next ECB president, the answer is not Weidmann.

There will also be calls to look for women to balance the overwhelming male ECB hierarchy. There is just one woman on the 25-member Governing Council.

Bundesbank Deputy Governor Claudia Buch, 53, and Bank of France Deputy Governor Sylvie Goulard, 54, would appear to lack monetary policy experience for the top job. But they and distinguished female economists such as OECD chief economist Laurence Boone, 50, London Business School professors Helene Rey, 49, and Lucrezia Reichlin, 64, are all well qualified for executive board positions.

There is one other contender who would appear amply qualified if the priority is to give Germany its turn in the ECB hot seat. Klaus Regling set up the eurozone’s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, from scratch after a career including the IMF, the German finance ministry and the European Commission. Regling, 69 later this year, might be German enough to reassure the burghers of Frankfurt but mentally flexible enough to do “whatever it takes” if there is another crisis.

Yet some people in Berlin and Frankfurt want to anoint Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank and standard-bearer of German monetary orthodoxy, as successor to Mario Draghi when the Italian ECB president steps down this fall.

The race for the most powerful and sensitive job in the European economy ought to be run strictly on its own merits. But like a rare lunar eclipse, the Bank’s eight-year appointment cycle coincides with the EU’s five-year political and legislative cycle for the first time since it was set up in 1998.

So the ECB nomination has become part of a wider package deal among EU leaders involving the top jobs in the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, as well as the bloc’s next foreign policy chief.

After leaders had a first informal discussion of this mercato last week, European Council President Donald Tusk said he would consult with the Parliament and national governments to try to “provide clarity on all these posts already in June” at the next EU summit. He also spoke of “the need to reflect the diversity of the Union when it comes to geography, the size of countries, gender as well as political affiliation.”

The ECB needs a leader willing to think outside the box and take unconventional action if required in a storm.

Tusk’s statement appeared to subordinate the choice of ECB chief to the outcome of the bigger political power struggle over the Commission presidency, and to the requirements of East-West, North-South, male-female and left-right-center balance. Put simply, if German Chancellor Angela Merkel fails to shoehorn Bavarian conservative Manfred Weber into the top Commission job, due to opposition led by French President Emmanuel Macron, Germany would have to be compensated with another major post.

That’s no way to choose a central bank chief who, in the absence of a central EU government, is the eurozone’s last line of defense against a financial meltdown. It could cost Europe dearly when the next crisis hits, whether due to a global trade war unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump, a chaotic no-deal Brexit, a fiscal explosion in Italy or some less predictable event.

367,Europe’s Syria quagmire,Nour Samaha,"Europe doesn’t have a Syria policy — at least not one that acknowledges what’s happening in the war-torn country.

Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is increasingly likely to win the brutal conflict that has ravaged the country for the past eight years. European leaders have yet to decide what to do “the day after” for the simple reason that they weren’t banking on Damascus coming out on top.

The civil war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands, caused massive destruction and created millions of refugees. Now Assad is reasserting his authority over the population and consolidating his territorial gains. His government is seeking to establish central control and rejecting anything it perceives as foreign pressure or interference.

The situation is bleak. The government has no vision of how to rebuild the country, and no resources to do so. Punitive Western sanctions have resulted in severe shortages in gas, fuel and electricity. The price of food and other goods has shot up, inflation is on the rise and wages have largely remained at a pre-war rate. Residents are forced to queue for hours at a time at petrol stations or to obtain cooking gas canisters.

Europe has explicitly stated it will not engage or normalize relations with Damascus, nor send aid for reconstruction, until its political conditions are met. That’s great in theory. In practice, however, it’s not a strategy that will work.

It’s no secret that this next chapter in Syria is one Europeans can’t agree on how to approach.

If Europe is to get what it wants on issues that affect national politics within its own borders — including security, terrorism, migration, asylum seekers and the question of refugee return — it has to adapt to what’s actually happening on the ground.

It’s no secret that this next chapter in Syria is one Europeans can’t agree on how to approach.

Depending on which diplomat you talk to you, some will say the regime needs to change its behavior; others talk of a political transition or constitutional reform. Others still are pushing for real regime change.

Europe has found no common ground on what its goals for Syria’s future should be. Countries like the United Kingdom, France and Germany have remained wedded to the U.N.-led Geneva process, in particular the implementation of Resolution 2254, which focuses on a political transition. But they haven’t clarified what kind of political transition would satisfy their demands.

Others, such as Italy, Poland and Hungary — largely driven by nationalist domestic agendas — want Europe to reengage with Assad so they can start sending refugees back to Syria.

Instead of coming up with a viable policy that acknowledges the new reality, the European Union is enforcing sanctions. Its hope is that, if the economic screws are tightened enough, the regime will have no choice but to acquiesce to its demands, or even — as some Western diplomats say privately — that a popular revolt from within the loyalist society will overthrow the regime.

Neither is likely. After eight years of deadly conflict, the population living in government-controlled areas has little appetite to rise against the regime — especially given there is currently no viable alternative to Assad.

Increased internal pressure will only feed the regime’s worst impulses and fuel a more intense crackdown on Syrian civilians. In recent months, the regime has even extended its security net to the loyalist community as criticism grew over the deteriorating economic situation. It arrested one of the most prominent regime media activists, questioned government-friendly civil society actors, and warning the population against being used as tools by external actors to instigate chaos.

What’s more, the regime has found that it can rely on an array of channels to ensure it survives economic pressure. Support comes from regional and international allies, smuggling networks, oligarchs and Syrian businessmen — all at little cost to its own political ambitions and methods of control.

As long as Europe’s sanctions persist and these channels continue to exist, Damascus will see little reason to change its behavior or compromise to meet Western demands.

The regime does not have the means to fund reconstruction, and the country’s deteriorating economy and its lack of infrastructure or work opportunities provide no real incentive for the regime to actively pursue refugee returns. Nor are those who fled likely to consider returning under these conditions.

Assad’s focus is on finding cash injections to stabilize Syria’s economy and consolidate his post-war control. Recent military advances into Idlib with Russian support have also made clear that the regime, despite its focus on economic survival, has not given up its territorial ambition. The economic situation is worsening and could lead to a second wave of refugees fleeing Syria to neighboring countries.

The concern that engaging with Assad would bestow him with legitimacy is not unfounded.

Europe urgently needs to come up with a policy that acknowledges the outcome of the war but still salvages its core principles. To do so, it must abandon any insistence on a political transition away from Assad, and instead seek to advance the needs of the Syrian people — and its own, related European interests.

The concern that engaging with Assad would bestow him with legitimacy is not unfounded. But Europeans should ask themselves who benefits most from their lack of engagement, when the Syrian regime is backed by external forces such as Russia and Iran.

The solution is for Europe to draw up mechanisms of conditional engagement that focus on more tangible issues such as detainee release and unhindered humanitarian access in return for improving humanitarian conditions and allowing NGOs to operate with less restrictions inside government-held areas.

Europe must acknowledge it has little negotiating room at the moment — in order to be able to make things better for Syrians, and Europeans, in the long term.

The solution is for Europe to draw up mechanisms of conditional engagement that focus on more tangible issues such as detainee release and unhindered humanitarian access in return for improving humanitarian conditions and allowing NGOs to operate with less restrictions inside government-held areas.

Europe must acknowledge it has little negotiating room at the moment — in order to be able to make things better for Syrians, and Europeans, in the long term.

369,Europe’s Syria quagmire,Julien Barnes-Dacey,"Europe doesn’t have a Syria policy — at least not one that acknowledges what’s happening in the war-torn country.

Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is increasingly likely to win the brutal conflict that has ravaged the country for the past eight years. European leaders have yet to decide what to do “the day after” for the simple reason that they weren’t banking on Damascus coming out on top.

The civil war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands, caused massive destruction and created millions of refugees. Now Assad is reasserting his authority over the population and consolidating his territorial gains. His government is seeking to establish central control and rejecting anything it perceives as foreign pressure or interference.

The situation is bleak. The government has no vision of how to rebuild the country, and no resources to do so. Punitive Western sanctions have resulted in severe shortages in gas, fuel and electricity. The price of food and other goods has shot up, inflation is on the rise and wages have largely remained at a pre-war rate. Residents are forced to queue for hours at a time at petrol stations or to obtain cooking gas canisters.

Europe has explicitly stated it will not engage or normalize relations with Damascus, nor send aid for reconstruction, until its political conditions are met. That’s great in theory. In practice, however, it’s not a strategy that will work.

It’s no secret that this next chapter in Syria is one Europeans can’t agree on how to approach.

If Europe is to get what it wants on issues that affect national politics within its own borders — including security, terrorism, migration, asylum seekers and the question of refugee return — it has to adapt to what’s actually happening on the ground.

It’s no secret that this next chapter in Syria is one Europeans can’t agree on how to approach.

Depending on which diplomat you talk to you, some will say the regime needs to change its behavior; others talk of a political transition or constitutional reform. Others still are pushing for real regime change.

Europe has found no common ground on what its goals for Syria’s future should be. Countries like the United Kingdom, France and Germany have remained wedded to the U.N.-led Geneva process, in particular the implementation of Resolution 2254, which focuses on a political transition. But they haven’t clarified what kind of political transition would satisfy their demands.

Others, such as Italy, Poland and Hungary — largely driven by nationalist domestic agendas — want Europe to reengage with Assad so they can start sending refugees back to Syria.

Instead of coming up with a viable policy that acknowledges the new reality, the European Union is enforcing sanctions. Its hope is that, if the economic screws are tightened enough, the regime will have no choice but to acquiesce to its demands, or even — as some Western diplomats say privately — that a popular revolt from within the loyalist society will overthrow the regime.

Neither is likely. After eight years of deadly conflict, the population living in government-controlled areas has little appetite to rise against the regime — especially given there is currently no viable alternative to Assad.

Increased internal pressure will only feed the regime’s worst impulses and fuel a more intense crackdown on Syrian civilians. In recent months, the regime has even extended its security net to the loyalist community as criticism grew over the deteriorating economic situation. It arrested one of the most prominent regime media activists, questioned government-friendly civil society actors, and warning the population against being used as tools by external actors to instigate chaos.

What’s more, the regime has found that it can rely on an array of channels to ensure it survives economic pressure. Support comes from regional and international allies, smuggling networks, oligarchs and Syrian businessmen — all at little cost to its own political ambitions and methods of control.

As long as Europe’s sanctions persist and these channels continue to exist, Damascus will see little reason to change its behavior or compromise to meet Western demands.

The regime does not have the means to fund reconstruction, and the country’s deteriorating economy and its lack of infrastructure or work opportunities provide no real incentive for the regime to actively pursue refugee returns. Nor are those who fled likely to consider returning under these conditions.

Assad’s focus is on finding cash injections to stabilize Syria’s economy and consolidate his post-war control. Recent military advances into Idlib with Russian support have also made clear that the regime, despite its focus on economic survival, has not given up its territorial ambition. The economic situation is worsening and could lead to a second wave of refugees fleeing Syria to neighboring countries.

The concern that engaging with Assad would bestow him with legitimacy is not unfounded.

Europe urgently needs to come up with a policy that acknowledges the outcome of the war but still salvages its core principles. To do so, it must abandon any insistence on a political transition away from Assad, and instead seek to advance the needs of the Syrian people — and its own, related European interests.

The concern that engaging with Assad would bestow him with legitimacy is not unfounded. But Europeans should ask themselves who benefits most from their lack of engagement, when the Syrian regime is backed by external forces such as Russia and Iran.

370,Theresa May’s passive-aggressive parting gift for Trump,Charlie Cooper,"LONDON — Donald Trump can do insults, but he could learn a thing or two from Theresa May about British passive aggression.

The outgoing prime minister will meet the U.S. president at Downing Street on the second day of his state visit Tuesday, and present him a gift laden with symbolism — and just a little snark: Winston Churchill’s own draft of the Atlantic Charter of 1941, a foundational text of the United Nations.

Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the U.N., pulling the U.S. out of some of its key initiatives and structures. And the gift will inevitably be read as a parting shot from the prime minister about the importance of multilateralism and the rules-based global order; territory where the U.K. and U.S. are increasingly at opposite sides of an ideological divide.

Queen Elizabeth herself also asserted the importance of the international institutions the U.S. helped found after the war. Addressing Trump at the state banquet in Buckingham Palace, she said: “After the shared sacrifices of the Second World War, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure that the horrors of conflict would never be repeated.""

""While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace,” she added.

After the royal pageantry of day one, Tuesday could see political fireworks, with the president's delegation engaging on policy matters with May’s government over a meeting in the Cabinet room and a lunch at No. 10 Downing Street’s State Dining Room. Trump and May are due to hold a joint press conference in the afternoon, before visiting the Churchill War Rooms museum beneath the streets of Westminster.

Day of protest

Protests are expected around the U.K., and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak at the London rally, a party official said.

Trump marked his arrival in the U.K. on Monday morning by lambasting the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who on Sunday wrote in the Observer newspaper that Trump should not have been granted a state visit, and compared his methods to those of “the fascists of the 20th century.”

Trump branded Khan a “stone cold loser,” attacked his record on crime in London and mocked his physical stature.

The president was still talking about Khan while being greeted on the tarmac at London Stansted Airport, according to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was there to meet him. “He mentioned to me some of his very strong views about the mayor of London. What he said to me was consistent with what was in his tweet,” Hunt told the BBC.

Trump later received a ceremonial welcome at Buckingham Palace, had a private lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, visited Westminster Abbey and had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla, the duchess of Cornwall, at Clarence House. He attended a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday evening, also attended by May and other U.K. Cabinet ministers, including leadership contenders Hunt and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.

The closest the president came to a Brexit reference was in his remarks at the banquet. Referring to the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings, he said: ""The courage of the United Kingdom’s sons and daughters ensured that your destiny would always remain in your own hands.""

Shortly after, the White House Tweeted: ""President Trump supports Brexit being accomplished in a way that maintains global economic stability while securing voters' wishes for U.K. independence.""

A clever gift

While the first day of the tour delivered the kind of pomp and ceremony that Trump admires the U.K. for, Tuesday is set to be more of a minefield, with London at loggerheads with Washington over the Iran nuclear deal, climate change policy and the U.K. government's openness to allowing Chinese telecoms giant Huawei access to its 5G network.

Downing Street in particular — which, with a lame duck prime minister, is viewing the trip in terms of “disaster management” — will be hoping Trump does not undermine May’s position any further at the joint press conference. He has already effectively endorsed one of the front-runners in the race to succeed her — former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson — and urged her government to bring his friend Nigel Farage, leader of the insurgent Brexit Party, into the Brexit negotiating team.

But May’s choice of gift — which has echoes of a 2017 speech to the Republican Party in Philadelphia, in which she urged Trump to take pride in multilateral organizations like the U.N. — is likely to raise eyebrows in the U.S. delegation.

Robin Niblett, director of the London-based Chatham House think tank, read it as “a clever gift, making the most of British history and soft power to make an important point to Britain's most important ally at a critical time.”

""Clearly, the U.N. is an institution Trump disparages. But the Atlantic Charter underlined the leadership role the U.K. and U.S. played together in bringing about peace post-1945. It suggests the two countries could overcome their current differences in tactics … in order to achieve common goals this century,” he said.

Tom Tugendhat, Conservative chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, said the gift was a reminder that both Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who co-signed the Atlantic Charter, ""knew we would need partners in the future.""

""It's great to see history used to remind us of the depths of our alliance and our duties,"" he said.

Melania Trump, meanwhile, will be presented with a ""bespoke No. 10 tea set.""

Before their Downing Street bilateral, May and Trump will attend a reception for U.S. and U.K. businesses at St. James’ Palace, involving firms such as BAE Systems, Goldman Sachs, GSK and Lockheed Martin.

While May is expected to talk up prospects of a post-Brexit free-trade agreement, Trump’s visit has highlighted serious hurdles before this can be agreed.

U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson insisted on Sunday that agriculture and health would be part of any such pact, a statement that appeared to be at odds with the U.K. position outlined by Hunt and Downing Street on Monday. The foreign secretary said he could not see National Health Service procurement ever being part of trade talks, while May’s spokesman insisted that the U.K. was not going to lower its environmental standards; a likely prerequisite for some U.S.-produced foods to enter the country.","LONDON — Donald Trump can do insults, but he could learn a thing or two from Theresa May about British passive aggression.

373,‘EU 6’ to discuss Commission president choice,Maïa De La Baume,"More than a week after the European Parliament election, the search for a European Commission president remains wide open with no clear front-runner — and a new approach to negotiations within the European Council is injecting yet another element of uncertainty.

As part of that new process, six EU leaders charged by their political party families with leading the search for a new Commission president will meet in Brussels on Friday evening to discuss candidates over dinner, several Council and EU officials told POLITICO.

At an informal European Council last week, leaders from the EU's three main political families — the European People's Party, the Party of European Socialists and the liberal ALDE — designated six ""coordinators"" to direct the discussions on filling the Commission presidency and nearly all of the EU's top jobs.

It is a complex undertaking that requires trying to address multiple imperatives, including taking account of the Parliament election results, as well as obligations to seek geographic and demographic balance, and to improve gender parity.

As coordinators, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovič and Latvia's Krišjānis Kariņš are representing the conservative EPP; Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his Belgian counterpart Charles Michel are representing the Liberals; and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Portugal's António Costa are representing the Social Democrats.

Friday's informal dinner, at least, will begin to push the entire process forward.

In 2014, the conservatives and Social Democrats won enough seats in the European Parliament to make the decision about top jobs largely a discussion between them, the EU's two largest political families, and there was essentially an agreement in place between Jean-Claude Juncker and his Socialist challenger, then Parliament President Martin Schulz, over the grand coalition they would form after the election.

But this year's more complicated election results mean that a broader coalition will be needed to form a majority among the pro-EU political families, and the Liberals and Socialists are insisting on breaking the monopoly that the EPP currently holds on the three top jobs: the presidencies of the Commission, Council and Parliament.

The new system of coordinators adds another layer to the already complex set of consultations set to begin between Council President Donald Tusk and party group leaders in the Parliament. The Council, voting by a qualified majority, must nominate a candidate for Commission president, but that candidate must then be confirmed by a majority in Parliament — meaning at least 376 of 751 votes.

""It's kind of a new invention,"" a senior EU official said of the new coordinators. ""I don't think that we are convinced that it will be sufficient.""

To some degree, the appointment of the six coordinators could weaken the role of the political group leaders; two of them — the conservatives' Manfred Weber and the Liberals' Guy Verhofstadt — are candidates for top jobs.

At the same time, the informal discussions among the coordinators are not necessarily where the ultimate decisions will be made and Tusk, as Council president, cannot rely on the coordinators to speak for all 28 heads of state and government. To start, the two most powerful EU leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, are not participating in those discussions.

There are also leaders of large EU countries, whose populations give them heavy weight in qualified majority voting, but who are not part of the three main families. These include U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, or her replacement, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

As a result, Tusk will need to continue his own intensive consultations with EU leaders, not knowing the extent to which the coordinators speak for others. ""It's not something that at this stage he can trust 100 percent,"" the senior EU official said, adding, ""It's not because Tusk is against it in any way.""

The full Council is due to have its next formal discussion on the leadership posts at a regular summit in Brussels later this month.

The Parliament election results were inconclusive, leaving a diminished EPP as the biggest group but controlling a far slimmer plurality, and making the conservatives a minority within the expected, larger pro-EU coalition that also includes the Social Democrats, Liberals and Greens, which is expected to lean center-left. As a result, officials are bracing for a potentially gridlocked process in which it will be difficult to settle on a nominee for the Commission presidency.

One possible path forward could involve leaders of the European Council moving more aggressively to fill other top jobs over which they have more control, namely the presidencies of the Council itself and the European Central Bank. Such a move would initially circumvent what could end up being divisive and protracted negotiations with the Parliament over the next Commission president. At the same time, whatever selections are made by the Council will have the effect of narrowing the choices for the Commission presidency given the requirements to achieve balance among the parties.

Friday's informal dinner, at least, will begin to push the entire process forward. Discussions, which normally take place in Parliament, have been stalled this time, partly because of initial disagreement among the parties over who would take the lead in coordinating the talks.","More than a week after the European Parliament election, the search for a European Commission president remains wide open with no clear front-runner — and a new approach to negotiations within the European Council is injecting yet another element of uncertainty.

374,‘EU 6’ to discuss Commission president choice,David M. Herszenhorn,"More than a week after the European Parliament election, the search for a European Commission president remains wide open with no clear front-runner — and a new approach to negotiations within the European Council is injecting yet another element of uncertainty.

As part of that new process, six EU leaders charged by their political party families with leading the search for a new Commission president will meet in Brussels on Friday evening to discuss candidates over dinner, several Council and EU officials told POLITICO.

At an informal European Council last week, leaders from the EU's three main political families — the European People's Party, the Party of European Socialists and the liberal ALDE — designated six ""coordinators"" to direct the discussions on filling the Commission presidency and nearly all of the EU's top jobs.

It is a complex undertaking that requires trying to address multiple imperatives, including taking account of the Parliament election results, as well as obligations to seek geographic and demographic balance, and to improve gender parity.

As coordinators, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovič and Latvia's Krišjānis Kariņš are representing the conservative EPP; Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his Belgian counterpart Charles Michel are representing the Liberals; and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Portugal's António Costa are representing the Social Democrats.

Friday's informal dinner, at least, will begin to push the entire process forward.

In 2014, the conservatives and Social Democrats won enough seats in the European Parliament to make the decision about top jobs largely a discussion between them, the EU's two largest political families, and there was essentially an agreement in place between Jean-Claude Juncker and his Socialist challenger, then Parliament President Martin Schulz, over the grand coalition they would form after the election.

But this year's more complicated election results mean that a broader coalition will be needed to form a majority among the pro-EU political families, and the Liberals and Socialists are insisting on breaking the monopoly that the EPP currently holds on the three top jobs: the presidencies of the Commission, Council and Parliament.

The new system of coordinators adds another layer to the already complex set of consultations set to begin between Council President Donald Tusk and party group leaders in the Parliament. The Council, voting by a qualified majority, must nominate a candidate for Commission president, but that candidate must then be confirmed by a majority in Parliament — meaning at least 376 of 751 votes.

""It's kind of a new invention,"" a senior EU official said of the new coordinators. ""I don't think that we are convinced that it will be sufficient.""

To some degree, the appointment of the six coordinators could weaken the role of the political group leaders; two of them — the conservatives' Manfred Weber and the Liberals' Guy Verhofstadt — are candidates for top jobs.

At the same time, the informal discussions among the coordinators are not necessarily where the ultimate decisions will be made and Tusk, as Council president, cannot rely on the coordinators to speak for all 28 heads of state and government. To start, the two most powerful EU leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, are not participating in those discussions.

There are also leaders of large EU countries, whose populations give them heavy weight in qualified majority voting, but who are not part of the three main families. These include U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, or her replacement, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

As a result, Tusk will need to continue his own intensive consultations with EU leaders, not knowing the extent to which the coordinators speak for others. ""It's not something that at this stage he can trust 100 percent,"" the senior EU official said, adding, ""It's not because Tusk is against it in any way.""

The full Council is due to have its next formal discussion on the leadership posts at a regular summit in Brussels later this month.

The Parliament election results were inconclusive, leaving a diminished EPP as the biggest group but controlling a far slimmer plurality, and making the conservatives a minority within the expected, larger pro-EU coalition that also includes the Social Democrats, Liberals and Greens, which is expected to lean center-left. As a result, officials are bracing for a potentially gridlocked process in which it will be difficult to settle on a nominee for the Commission presidency.

One possible path forward could involve leaders of the European Council moving more aggressively to fill other top jobs over which they have more control, namely the presidencies of the Council itself and the European Central Bank. Such a move would initially circumvent what could end up being divisive and protracted negotiations with the Parliament over the next Commission president. At the same time, whatever selections are made by the Council will have the effect of narrowing the choices for the Commission presidency given the requirements to achieve balance among the parties.

Friday's informal dinner, at least, will begin to push the entire process forward. Discussions, which normally take place in Parliament, have been stalled this time, partly because of initial disagreement among the parties over who would take the lead in coordinating the talks.","More than a week after the European Parliament election, the search for a European Commission president remains wide open with no clear front-runner — and a new approach to negotiations within the European Council is injecting yet another element of uncertainty.

ROME — Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte threatened to step down if the ruling League and 5Star Movement don't stop bickering.

At a news conference in Rome on Monday evening, Conte said he had been ""naive in thinking the two parties would settle their differences after the European election"" in which the League won 28 seats and the 5Stars 14.

Conte — who was plucked from relative obscurity last year to lead the coalition government — insisted he does not belong to any political party and only has Italians' best interests at heart. But he said it only makes sense for him to continue if the government's five-year plan can be implemented.

Conte also said he would try his best to carry on talking with the European Commission over the country's budget to avoid potential sanctions. However, he called on his deputies, the League's Matteo Salvini and the 5Stars' Luigi Di Maio, to send unambiguous messages to help restore financial markets' faith in the country.

""The next budget law must put the country's public finances back on track because EU rules won't change until we manage to change them,"" Conte said.

Salvini's League wants a 15 percent flat tax for individuals and businesses, which would increase the country's budget deficit. Brussels is due to decide on Wednesday whether it wants to trigger a procedure against Italy that could result in a €3.5 billion fine.

""It's up to the political forces to decide whether they want the government to continue ...

381,Pompeo blasts China on anniversary of Tiananmen Square massacre,Nahal Toosi,"Mike Pompeo gives statements to the media | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Pompeo blasts China on anniversary of Tiananmen Square massacre The top US diplomat spoke of American hopes that China’s integration into the global economy would lead to a ‘more open, tolerant society.’

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed China’s human rights record on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, calling on Beijing to end its oppression of Uighur Muslims and other groups.

In a statement released at 12:01 a.m. Beijing time Tuesday to coincide with the anniversary, the top U.S. diplomat spoke wistfully of American hopes that China’s integration into the global economy would lead to a “more open, tolerant society.”

“Those hopes have been dashed,” said Pompeo, who is on travel in Europe. “China’s one-party state tolerates no dissent and abuses human rights whenever it serves its interests.”

The Communist Party leadership is “methodically attempting to strangle Uighur culture and stamp out the Islamic faith, including through the detention of more than 1 million members of Muslim minority groups,” Pompeo added.

Pompeo has consistently pointed out China’s human rights abuses during his tenure as secretary of state, among a raft of critiques the secretary of state has leveled at Beijing -- from its militarization of the South China Sea and the Arctic to its trade practices to its use of mass surveillance.

The Trump administration as a whole has made promoting religious liberty abroad a top priority, a move that has thrilled its evangelical Christian base in the United States.

But Pompeo’s statement also illustrates how selective the administration can be in calling out human rights abuses.

To an unusual degree compared to its predecessors, the administration has preferred to highlight human rights abuses by countries it considers adversaries, such as Iran, while avoiding discussing similar abuses by U.S. allies, such as Saudi Arabia.

President Donald Trump himself often avoids mentioning human rights at all — he has said nothing in public, for instance, about the 2017 mass killings and displacement of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, an atrocity some analysts say amounts to a genocide.

He also dropped his intense criticism of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s many human rights abuses as the two became engaged in nuclear talks. After meeting Kim in Singapore last year for the first of two historic summits, Trump called the dictator, who keeps tens of thousands of North Koreans in gulags, a “smart” and “funny guy” who “loves his people.”

On China, U.S. officials have been selective in raising human rights. Human rights activists believe the administration has held off on imposing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in oppressing the Uighurs to avoid upsetting trade negotiations.

Still, State Department officials insist they are determined to hold China to account. Days ago, new department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus used the occasion of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and one of her first appearances before reporters, to urge China to end its “particularly cruel and inhumane” of Muslims.

The 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square killings is sure to spur criticism of Beijing from many corners.

On June 4, 1989, China’s communist leaders sent tanks into Tiananmen Square to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrations. The ensuing death toll likely ranges in the hundreds or even higher, though the exact total remains unknown due to Chinese government censorship.

“The events of 30 years ago still stir our conscience, and the conscience of freedom-loving people around the world,” Pompeo said in his statement. “We urge the Chinese government to make a full, public accounting of those killed or missing to give comfort to the many victims of this dark chapter of history.”

Pompeo's comments stand in stark contrast to those in a 1990 interview Trump, then a private businessman, conducted with Playboy.

""When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it,"" Trump said. ""Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.""","Mike Pompeo gives statements to the media | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Pompeo blasts China on anniversary of Tiananmen Square massacre The top US diplomat spoke of American hopes that China’s integration into the global economy would lead to a ‘more open, tolerant society.’U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed China’s human rights record on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, calling on Beijing to end its oppression of Uighur Muslims and other groups.

382,Trump visit highlights UK’s Brexit choices,Tom Mctague,"LONDON — No leader, no majority, no clue what to do next. Welcome to Brexit Britain, Mr. President.

Donald Trump, having touched down in the U.K. this morning, finds a country at a crossroads, not only unsure which way to turn, but how to turn and if it will be able to.

For this president in particular — but, in truth, any U.S. president in this position — Britain’s problems are America’s opportunities.

From trade and security to China, Russia and Iran, the United States has clear expectations of its “special” ally — and greater leverage than ever before thanks to the position the U.K. has put itself in, halfway out of the EU but without a clear idea of how to extricate itself fully.

Ultimately, British officials admit, outside the EU the U.K. needs the U.S. more than ever before. “Look at what we’re doing,” said one Foreign Office official, “a lot of it is about keeping the special relationship alive.”

Previously, if the Americans complained about EU protectionism, Brussels could be blamed. No longer.

By leaving the protective walls of the EU’s single market, customs union and security networks, the choices already facing medium-sized economies like Britain’s in the 21st century are only brought into sharper focus.

How should the rise of China be handled? What type of economy can thrive outside a major trade bloc? What price free trade? Should the country prioritize prosperity or security?

Economically, an American trade deal is the single biggest prize available to Brexit Britain — other than a deal with the EU. Yet this comes with significant political costs, including further complicating the Irish border. Any trade deal involving increased access for U.S. food forces a decision on London: should it apply equally to Northern Ireland, thereby hardening the border with the Republic, or should different rules apply to different parts of the U.K.?

Britain’s membership of the EU had meant some American requests were off limits: with trade deals benefiting American farmers and health firms two obvious examples.

Previously, if the Americans complained about EU protectionism, Brussels could be blamed. No longer.

The U.S. ambassador to the U.K., Woody Johnson, gave a flavor of this in his interview with the BBC Sunday, telling Andrew Marr “the entire economy” should be opened up to American competition — farming and health care included.

But it’s not just food, farming and health care where the price for the special relationship will involve difficult tradeoffs.

Away from the pomp and pageantry of the state visit, the U.S. president has a list of serious requests for the outgoing British prime minister.

On Iran, the U.S. will press its ally to toe the hard line it has set against the regime in Tehran, which has been opposed by London, Paris and Berlin.

Even more pressingly, there’s China and its Huawei 5G network.

In his interview, Ambassador Johnson said the president would raise concerns about “the risk of allowing your infrastructure to be built by a country that has a totally different setup.”

In the great game of international affairs, the United States is locked in a battle for supremacy with China: on trade, security and defense. The European Union is attempting to create its own third pole of global power, with or without the U.K.

In his visit to the U.K. this week Trump is pressing Britain to choose its side. The U.K. has not yet made up its mind.

383,German SPD picks 3 musketeers to calm fears,Judith Mischke,"Malu Dreyer (left) and Manuela Schwesing (right) are two of the three politicians chosen to lead the SPD on an interim basis | Carsten Koall/Getty Images German SPD picks 3 musketeers to calm fears Trio chosen to run Merkel’s coalition partners on interim basis after sudden resignation of leader.

BERLIN — Three heads are better than one.

That was the conclusion of Germany's beleaguered Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Angela Merkel's government, who on Monday appointed a trio of prominent members to run the party on an interim basis after their leader suddenly quit.

Andrea Nahles, who was in office for just over a year, announced her resignation on Sunday in the wake of disastrous showings in the European Parliament election and a regional vote in Bremen last month.

Nahles' decision raised fresh questions about how long the current government will last, as many SPD members argue that their alliance with Merkel's Christian Democrats has diluted the party's identity and resulted in a loss of support.

The interim trio includes two women: Manuela Schwesig, currently state premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and a former family affairs minister, and Malu Dreyer, state premier of Rhineland-Palatinate. They will be joined by Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, leader of the SPD in the Hesse state parliament, where the party is in opposition.

The selection of the three veterans was meant to stabilize the party and signal that it is in safe hands. Yet by picking a trio, instead of a single interim leader as most expected, the leadership again highlighted the deep divisions within the struggling party.

After burning through three party leaders in less than three years, the position has become such a hot seat that few seem keen to take it. All three members of the new leadership team were quick to insist they had no designs on the job in the long term.

Finding someone with the experience and gravitas to deliver the party out of its current malaise looks like a tall order. Whatever course the party takes, it will need to pick a new leader before the end of the summer in order to stand a better chance in upcoming regional elections in several east German states in the fall. A prolonged selection process would only deepen doubts over the party’s future.

In theory, the trio can serve as provisional leaders until the next party conference, which is currently scheduled for December. But that gathering could well be brought forward.

At a press conference in Berlin on Monday afternoon, the trio accepted their nomination but stressed that all three of them only intended to lead the party on a provisional basis.

""We're not running for the party chair,"" said Dreyer. She added that Nahles had received “big applause” after stepping down and that the SPD would ""have a lot to thank her for.""

Schäfer-Gümbel called on his party to use this chance for a new beginning ""quickly, but also prudently.”

In an echo of the Three Musketeers, he said the new leadership team had adopted the motto of ""one for all, and all for one.""

Party bosses also picked an interim leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag — another post vacated by Nahles. Rolf Mützenich, a deputy leader of the group, will step up to take the post.

The SPD has been in steady decline for years, scoring its weakest national election result since 1993 in the last German general election in 2017.

In late May, it suffered a double blow that underscored just how far the party has fallen. The SPD secured just 15.8 percent of the vote in last month's European Parliament election, coming in a distant third to the Christian Democrats and the Greens.

On the same day as the European vote, the party lost the city-state of Bremen, a Social Democrat stronghold where it had held control for nearly 74 years.

Discontent over the May election results had prompted Nahles to call a vote on Tuesday this week to determine whether she should continue to lead the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag.

She then preempted that vote with her resignation announcement in which she said she would quit the party leadership on Monday morning and the parliamentary group leadership on Tuesday.

""I have just said goodbye to the party executives,"" Nahles told reporters upon leaving the party's Berlin headquarters on Monday morning, adding: ""I have resigned.""

The interim leaders stressed that the SPD had no immediate plans to quit Merkel's coalition. But the party leadership will meet on June 24 to plot a way forward, including how to approach a stocktaking of the government's work later this year.

“Our members voted to enter the coalition, and we stick to our agreement. The coalition agreement has a revision clause,"" Dreyer said. ""So we will discuss on June 24 what projects are important to us and how we should apply the review clause.”

384,Can Trump still sue his way out of trouble?,Michael Kruse,"U.S. President Donald Trump | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Can Trump still sue his way out of trouble? As a developer he loved taking his enemies to court. As president he’s still running the same aggressive playbook, and this time it’s writing history in real time.

WASHINGTON — To keep hidden the details of his long-clandestine finances, Donald Trump has been waging a legal war wildly unusual for a commander-in-chief. He and his allies and associated business entities have sued two big banks he did business with plus Trump’s own accounting firm as well as the Democratic chairman of the congressional oversight committee. So far, federal judges have rejected these lawsuits, and Trump’s attorneys have appealed to keep the cases going.

These tactics, testing the limits of the separation of powers that underpin the government of this country, have been called “outlandish” in Congress. To those, though, who have followed Trump’s career, they’re nothing if not predictable. For nearly half a century, Trump, 72, has used lawsuits as cudgels and prods and publicity stunts. He and his wingmen have used them, or threats of them, to harass, to deflect and delay, to punish opponents and protect his brand, his money, his image, himself. Even in the face of losses, he has used them to find a way to win.

The difference now is that Trump’s legal arsenal includes not just an array of personal attorneys but the vast resources of the Department of Justice — which at times he has hoped would serve the same role as his most bare-knuckled advocates. He is fighting personal legal battles that have ramifications today and potentially well into the future for the nation’s most important public office. Apples-to-apples numbers on this front are hard to come by, according to experts on the presidency and the judiciary, but scholars are confident in stating that Trump (with the possible exception of Richard Nixon) is unique in this regard. “I know of no president who was so openly combative and willing to sue and be sued,” said presidential historian Robert Dallek, who is working on a book called ""How Did We Get Here: From TR to Donald Trump.""

The people who have known him the longest are not surprised in the least. “He sues,” said Barbara Res, the Trump Tower construction manager and a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization. “That’s his M.O. He sues.”

“It’s just another tool in his war chest,” said Jack O’Donnell, the former president of the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. “He uses it to wear people out, whether it’s financially or emotionally.”

If nothing else, Trump has had an abundance of practice.

“He’s used litigation historically to keep hostile forces at bay and to delay reckonings,” Trump biographer Tim O’Brien said. “He’s also used it to try to embarrass competitors, critics or opponents. And I think by and large he’s done that successfully. He’s the poster child for the abuses and inefficiencies of the American court system.”

But can it work in this new venue? “That,” O’Brien said, “is the question that’s being tested right now: Is Donald Trump, as president, above the law?”

***

He’s not above the law. He’s just using it like any other citizen can, and should. That’s the view, at least, of Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor emeritus and frequent Trump defender. And it might even serve a useful political function.

“Everything Trump does is steeped in Roy Cohn’s mentoring and teaching” — David Lloyd Marcus, Cohn's cousin

“Bringing lawsuits is a way of invoking the system of checks and balances,” Dershowitz said, “and presidents historically have brought lawsuits, have responded to lawsuits — it’s a way of bringing the judiciary into the system of checks and balances that are tripartite in nature.” He called “reasonable” litigation “a perfectly appropriate use of the system of checks and balances.”

If nothing else, Trump has had an abundance of practice. His exhaustive history of weaponizing the courts started in 1973, when DOJ sued Trump and his father for racist rental policies in their fiefdom of outer-borough apartment buildings. Trump responded by hiring Roy Cohn, the notorious judicial and political fixer who’s been called “pure evil,” “a legal executioner,” and “one of the most despicable people in American history.” Cohn and Trump sued the feds right back — for $100 million. “The countersuit was bullshit,” said Elyse Goldweber, one of the prosecutors involved. But it extended the timetable of the case and turned it into a public relations skirmish as much as a matter to be settled purely in court. Nearly two years later, Trump and his father signed a consent decree pledging to change their ways, “one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated,” as DOJ put it. Trump, unchastened, insisted it was a win — a precursor to one of his most telltale maneuvers. Furthermore, for the government, the aftermath was galling. With Cohn at the point, the Trumps for years dragged their feet, exasperating subsequent prosecutors and effectively defanging the enforcement of the decree. As a whole, it would prove to be a singular font of so much of what was to come.

“Trump claims he went to Wharton business school,” presidential historian Doug Brinkley said. “What he did was attend Roy Cohn University.”

“Everything Trump does is steeped in Roy Cohn’s mentoring and teaching,” Cohn cousin David Lloyd Marcus said. “Roy knew that you could threaten to litigate, and that often that was enough. But also Roy knew that you could tie up things in the courts for years. Years. This is all right from the Roy playbook.”

A voracious pupil of the ruthless attorney, Trump has sued or been sued at least 4,000 times, according to the yeoman’s work of reporters from USA Today. He has sued people over unpaid royalties in licensing deals. He has sued Miss Pennsylvania. He has sued Bill Maher. He has sued the creator of ""Jeopardy!"" and ""Wheel of Fortune."" He has sued Scotland. He has sued New Jersey. He has sued New York City, and he has sued New York State. He has sued Palm Beach. He has sued an architecture critic from Chicago. He has sued the secretary of the interior and the National Indian Gaming Commission. He has sued people for using his surname in businesses … even though it was also their surname. He has sued and been sued by his first ex-wife. He has sued and been sued by Steve Wynn. He has sued and been sued by longtime business partners. “Just another lawsuit filed by Trump as a diversionary tactic,” a spokesman for one of those partners once said, “attempting to intimidate and to substitute publicity for substance.” He has threatened to file countless lawsuits he then hasn’t filed.

And legal documents show that when he has to give sworn answers, he is a grudging, hair-splitting deponent, performing his own versions of Bill Clinton-esque parsing. “Well, the word ‘developing,’” he once said in a deposition, “it doesn’t mean that we’re the developers.”

“Every morning he wakes up and says, ‘Who can I sue?’” — John Scanlon, late PR professional

“I know lots about litigation,” Trump said in a speech at a get-together of the Nevada Republican Party in Las Vegas in 2011.

“Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?” he asked at a campaign rally in January 2016. “I’m like a Ph.D. in litigation.”

“It’s a business for me,” he told Megyn Kelly that May, calling it a “tactic,” “and I have been successful — and I’ve, you know, used litigation, and sometimes I use it maybe when I shouldn’t, and sometimes I don’t.”

Last month’s lawsuit was not, for instance, the first time he sued Deutsche Bank. Back in 2008, he filed a suit against his most noted lender, attempting to wiggle his way out of $40 million of a construction loan he had personally guaranteed, worried he was staring at a catastrophe at the onset of the recession, taking the extraordinary legal position that the national real estate bust was an unforeseeable act of God, same as a tsunami or hurricane, that should void his obligations. It was, said one of the attorneys for the bank, “kind of crazy” and “kind of telling.”

“Every morning he wakes up and says, ‘Who can I sue?’” late public relations maestro John Scanlon once said.

“Anytime he thought someone was going to sue him,” Res said last week, “he would find a way to sue them first, because he wanted to be the plaintiff. He had this notion that if you were the plaintiff, you had a better chance of winning.”

“Most of the time he’s gotten the results he’s wanted” — Tim O'Brien, Trump biographer

There are, however, plenty of losses on Trump’s legal ledger.

He lost to the NFL. He lost to Marvin Roffman. He lost to Vera Coking of Atlantic City. And he lost to O’Brien, the biographer, whom he sued for reporting that Trump wasn’t worth what he said he was worth.

“He lost,” O’Brien stated bluntly. “Because the weight of everything was on our side. He routinely says publicly that he cost me a lot of money. He knows that’s not true. I didn’t pay a dime for any of that litigation. The New York Times’ lawyers were free to me, and my book publishers paid for outside counsel. And he knows he didn’t win that case. And he knows the results of choosing to litigate were far, far more damaging for him than for me.”

But O’Brien cautioned onlookers at this stage about reading too much into how that went down.

“That’s the exception, actually, in the long history of his litigation,” he said. “Most of the time he’s gotten the results he’s wanted.”

***

What was it that he wanted? To intimidate. To pay less. To save face by distancing himself from faltering projects. To fuel publicity. To buy time. To win in the longer run. For now, the Trump administration’s “win rate” in the federal courts is abysmal. The two recent suits he filed to block subpoenas for his records were summarily shot down, both judges ruling with unusual speed and dismissiveness. In these cases, if Trump was trying to delay, if he was trying to intimidate, it didn’t work. “It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a president for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct,” one of the judges wrote, adding that Trump’s legal arguments had “fundamental” problems. At this, though, Dershowitz shrugged. “What’s important,” he said, “is what the courts ultimately decide, not how many lower courts go against him.”

“Contemporary presidents end up in court a lot, mostly regarding their interpretation of regulatory statutes,” said Texas A&M professor George C. Edwards III, the editor of Presidential Studies Quarterly. “Trump is unusual in his blanket resistance to accommodating congressional investigations, which leads to numerous lawsuits.”

“He is using what he knows how to do best” — Hank Sheinkopf, Democratic strategist

“This is another case where President Trump’s behavior is norm-busting,” added Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.

Trump has never had to grapple with this high a degree of scrutiny and interference. He also and equally notably has never had more power, and one of the primary ways in which he’s already a president of great consequence is that he has markedly altered the ideological makeup of the federal judiciary — up to and including, of course, the Supreme Court. And this is what people who know him the best think about when they think about Trump in his role as litigator in chief.

“I think he expects that the judges he appoints will help him one day,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer and a CNN analyst.

“I think he believes that every suit he’s involved in will go to the Supreme Court and he will win,” Res said.

“Because he’s got the deck stacked,” O’Donnell said.

“I think,” O’Brien said, “unless institutions, particularly the law enforcement community and Congress, stand up for the rule of law, Trump is going to do an end-run around people.”

“I think all he wants to do is get to November 2020,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond and an expert on the federal judiciary, “and he’ll be able to drag it out in the courts if he wants to.”

And it all traces back to the beginning. “He is using what he knows how to do best,” said veteran New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf, who’s been watching Trump for decades, “his knowledge of how to use the legal process and lawyers to stop his opponents from injuring him. And it’s worked. So why shouldn’t it work here?”","U.S. President Donald Trump | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Can Trump still sue his way out of trouble?

Trump responded by hiring Roy Cohn, the notorious judicial and political fixer who’s been called “pure evil,” “a legal executioner,” and “one of the most despicable people in American history.” Cohn and Trump sued the feds right back — for $100 million. “The countersuit was bullshit,” said Elyse Goldweber, one of the prosecutors involved. But it extended the timetable of the case and turned it into a public relations skirmish as much as a matter to be settled purely in court. Nearly two years later, Trump and his father signed a consent decree pledging to change their ways, “one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated,” as DOJ put it. Trump, unchastened, insisted it was a win — a precursor to one of his most telltale maneuvers. Furthermore, for the government, the aftermath was galling. With Cohn at the point, the Trumps for years dragged their feet, exasperating subsequent prosecutors and effectively defanging the enforcement of the decree. As a whole, it would prove to be a singular font of so much of what was to come.

“Trump claims he went to Wharton business school,” presidential historian Doug Brinkley said. “What he did was attend Roy Cohn University.”

“Everything Trump does is steeped in Roy Cohn’s mentoring and teaching,” Cohn cousin David Lloyd Marcus said. “Roy knew that you could threaten to litigate, and that often that was enough. But also Roy knew that you could tie up things in the courts for years. Years. This is all right from the Roy playbook.”

A voracious pupil of the ruthless attorney, Trump has sued or been sued at least 4,000 times, according to the yeoman’s work of reporters from USA Today. He has sued people over unpaid royalties in licensing deals. He has sued Miss Pennsylvania. He has sued Bill Maher. He has sued the creator of ""Jeopardy!"" and ""Wheel of Fortune."" He has sued Scotland. He has sued New Jersey. He has sued New York City, and he has sued New York State. He has sued Palm Beach. He has sued an architecture critic from Chicago. He has sued the secretary of the interior and the National Indian Gaming Commission. He has sued people for using his surname in businesses … even though it was also their surname. He has sued and been sued by his first ex-wife. He has sued and been sued by Steve Wynn. He has sued and been sued by longtime business partners. “Just another lawsuit filed by Trump as a diversionary tactic,” a spokesman for one of those partners once said, “attempting to intimidate and to substitute publicity for substance.” He has threatened to file countless lawsuits he then hasn’t filed.

And legal documents show that when he has to give sworn answers, he is a grudging, hair-splitting deponent, performing his own versions of Bill Clinton-esque parsing. “Well, the word ‘developing,’” he once said in a deposition, “it doesn’t mean that we’re the developers.”

“Every morning he wakes up and says, ‘Who can I sue?’” — John Scanlon, late PR professional

“I know lots about litigation,” Trump said in a speech at a get-together of the Nevada Republican Party in Las Vegas in 2011.

“Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?” he asked at a campaign rally in January 2016. “I’m like a Ph.D. in litigation.”

“It’s a business for me,” he told Megyn Kelly that May, calling it a “tactic,” “and I have been successful — and I’ve, you know, used litigation, and sometimes I use it maybe when I shouldn’t, and sometimes I don’t.”

Last month’s lawsuit was not, for instance, the first time he sued Deutsche Bank. Back in 2008, he filed a suit against his most noted lender, attempting to wiggle his way out of $40 million of a construction loan he had personally guaranteed, worried he was staring at a catastrophe at the onset of the recession, taking the extraordinary legal position that the national real estate bust was an unforeseeable act of God, same as a tsunami or hurricane, that should void his obligations. It was, said one of the attorneys for the bank, “kind of crazy” and “kind of telling.”

“Every morning he wakes up and says, ‘Who can I sue?’” late public relations maestro John Scanlon once said.

“Anytime he thought someone was going to sue him,” Res said last week, “he would find a way to sue them first, because he wanted to be the plaintiff. He had this notion that if you were the plaintiff, you had a better chance of winning.”

“Most of the time he’s gotten the results he’s wanted” — Tim O'Brien, Trump biographer

There are, however, plenty of losses on Trump’s legal ledger.

He lost to the NFL. He lost to Marvin Roffman. He lost to Vera Coking of Atlantic City. And he lost to O’Brien, the biographer, whom he sued for reporting that Trump wasn’t worth what he said he was worth.

“He lost,” O’Brien stated bluntly. “Because the weight of everything was on our side. He routinely says publicly that he cost me a lot of money. He knows that’s not true. I didn’t pay a dime for any of that litigation. The New York Times’ lawyers were free to me, and my book publishers paid for outside counsel. And he knows he didn’t win that case. And he knows the results of choosing to litigate were far, far more damaging for him than for me.”

But O’Brien cautioned onlookers at this stage about reading too much into how that went down.

“That’s the exception, actually, in the long history of his litigation,” he said. “Most of the time he’s gotten the results he’s wanted.”

***

What was it that he wanted? To intimidate. To pay less. To save face by distancing himself from faltering projects. To fuel publicity. To buy time. To win in the longer run. For now, the Trump administration’s “win rate” in the federal courts is abysmal. The two recent suits he filed to block subpoenas for his records were summarily shot down, both judges ruling with unusual speed and dismissiveness. In these cases, if Trump was trying to delay, if he was trying to intimidate, it didn’t work. “It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a president for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct,” one of the judges wrote, adding that Trump’s legal arguments had “fundamental” problems. At this, though, Dershowitz shrugged. “What’s important,” he said, “is what the courts ultimately decide, not how many lower courts go against him.”

“Contemporary presidents end up in court a lot, mostly regarding their interpretation of regulatory statutes,” said Texas A&M professor George C. Edwards III, the editor of Presidential Studies Quarterly. “Trump is unusual in his blanket resistance to accommodating congressional investigations, which leads to numerous lawsuits.”

“He is using what he knows how to do best” — Hank Sheinkopf, Democratic strategist

“This is another case where President Trump’s behavior is norm-busting,” added Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.

Trump has never had to grapple with this high a degree of scrutiny and interference. He also and equally notably has never had more power, and one of the primary ways in which he’s already a president of great consequence is that he has markedly altered the ideological makeup of the federal judiciary — up to and including, of course, the Supreme Court. And this is what people who know him the best think about when they think about Trump in his role as litigator in chief.

“I think he expects that the judges he appoints will help him one day,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer and a CNN analyst.

“I think he believes that every suit he’s involved in will go to the Supreme Court and he will win,” Res said.

“Because he’s got the deck stacked,” O’Donnell said.

“I think,” O’Brien said, “unless institutions, particularly the law enforcement community and Congress, stand up for the rule of law, Trump is going to do an end-run around people.”

“I think all he wants to do is get to November 2020,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond and an expert on the federal judiciary, “and he’ll be able to drag it out in the courts if he wants to.”

And it all traces back to the beginning. “He is using what he knows how to do best,” said veteran New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf, who’s been watching Trump for decades, “his knowledge of how to use the legal process and lawyers to stop his opponents from injuring him. And it’s worked. So why shouldn’t it work here?”","U.S. President Donald Trump | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Can Trump still sue his way out of trouble?

387,Can Trump still sue his way out of trouble?,Quint Forgey,"U.S. President Donald Trump | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Can Trump still sue his way out of trouble? As a developer he loved taking his enemies to court. As president he’s still running the same aggressive playbook, and this time it’s writing history in real time.

WASHINGTON — To keep hidden the details of his long-clandestine finances, Donald Trump has been waging a legal war wildly unusual for a commander-in-chief. He and his allies and associated business entities have sued two big banks he did business with plus Trump’s own accounting firm as well as the Democratic chairman of the congressional oversight committee. So far, federal judges have rejected these lawsuits, and Trump’s attorneys have appealed to keep the cases going.

These tactics, testing the limits of the separation of powers that underpin the government of this country, have been called “outlandish” in Congress. To those, though, who have followed Trump’s career, they’re nothing if not predictable. For nearly half a century, Trump, 72, has used lawsuits as cudgels and prods and publicity stunts. He and his wingmen have used them, or threats of them, to harass, to deflect and delay, to punish opponents and protect his brand, his money, his image, himself. Even in the face of losses, he has used them to find a way to win.

The difference now is that Trump’s legal arsenal includes not just an array of personal attorneys but the vast resources of the Department of Justice — which at times he has hoped would serve the same role as his most bare-knuckled advocates. He is fighting personal legal battles that have ramifications today and potentially well into the future for the nation’s most important public office. Apples-to-apples numbers on this front are hard to come by, according to experts on the presidency and the judiciary, but scholars are confident in stating that Trump (with the possible exception of Richard Nixon) is unique in this regard. “I know of no president who was so openly combative and willing to sue and be sued,” said presidential historian Robert Dallek, who is working on a book called ""How Did We Get Here: From TR to Donald Trump.""

The people who have known him the longest are not surprised in the least. “He sues,” said Barbara Res, the Trump Tower construction manager and a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization. “That’s his M.O. He sues.”

“It’s just another tool in his war chest,” said Jack O’Donnell, the former president of the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. “He uses it to wear people out, whether it’s financially or emotionally.”

If nothing else, Trump has had an abundance of practice.

“He’s used litigation historically to keep hostile forces at bay and to delay reckonings,” Trump biographer Tim O’Brien said. “He’s also used it to try to embarrass competitors, critics or opponents. And I think by and large he’s done that successfully. He’s the poster child for the abuses and inefficiencies of the American court system.”

But can it work in this new venue? “That,” O’Brien said, “is the question that’s being tested right now: Is Donald Trump, as president, above the law?”

***

He’s not above the law. He’s just using it like any other citizen can, and should. That’s the view, at least, of Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor emeritus and frequent Trump defender. And it might even serve a useful political function.

“Everything Trump does is steeped in Roy Cohn’s mentoring and teaching” — David Lloyd Marcus, Cohn's cousin

“Bringing lawsuits is a way of invoking the system of checks and balances,” Dershowitz said, “and presidents historically have brought lawsuits, have responded to lawsuits — it’s a way of bringing the judiciary into the system of checks and balances that are tripartite in nature.” He called “reasonable” litigation “a perfectly appropriate use of the system of checks and balances.”

If nothing else, Trump has had an abundance of practice. His exhaustive history of weaponizing the courts started in 1973, when DOJ sued Trump and his father for racist rental policies in their fiefdom of outer-borough apartment buildings. Trump responded by hiring Roy Cohn, the notorious judicial and political fixer who’s been called “pure evil,” “a legal executioner,” and “one of the most despicable people in American history.” Cohn and Trump sued the feds right back — for $100 million. “The countersuit was bullshit,” said Elyse Goldweber, one of the prosecutors involved. But it extended the timetable of the case and turned it into a public relations skirmish as much as a matter to be settled purely in court. Nearly two years later, Trump and his father signed a consent decree pledging to change their ways, “one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated,” as DOJ put it. Trump, unchastened, insisted it was a win — a precursor to one of his most telltale maneuvers. Furthermore, for the government, the aftermath was galling. With Cohn at the point, the Trumps for years dragged their feet, exasperating subsequent prosecutors and effectively defanging the enforcement of the decree. As a whole, it would prove to be a singular font of so much of what was to come.

“Trump claims he went to Wharton business school,” presidential historian Doug Brinkley said. “What he did was attend Roy Cohn University.”

388,Trump calls London mayor ‘stone cold loser’ before landing in UK,Paul Dallison,"U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media before leaving the White House on June 2 | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Trump calls London mayor ‘stone cold loser’ before landing in UK Sadiq Khan ‘reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC,’ US president says.

Donald Trump hadn't even landed in London before he launched a Twitter attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Trump, who begins an official state visit to the U.K. today, said that Khan ""who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly 'nasty' to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.""

Seconds later, Trump added: ""Kahn [sic] reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, [Bill] de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job.""

He added: ""In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!""

A day earlier, Khan had condemned the red-carpet treatment being given to Trump.

He wrote in the Observer that Trump ""is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat. The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years.

""Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Matteo Salvini in Italy, Marine Le Pen in France and Nigel Farage here in the UK are using the same divisive tropes of the fascists of the 20th century to garner support, but with new sinister methods to deliver their message. And they are gaining ground and winning power and influence in places that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.”

Speaking to the BBC after greeting Trump on the tarmac at Stansted Airport, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the president had talked about Khan during their brief exchange.

“He mentioned to me some of his feelings about the Mayor of London which he subsequently tweeted out so it was obviously on his mind,” said Hunt.

“I think if you look at his tweet, he wasn’t going to be inviting Sadiq Khan for the sort of royal treatment at the White House any time soon,” he added.

The foreign secretary said he had told the president that the U.K. would put on ""a great show"" for him. Asked if he is worried that Trump would ignite further controversy, he said: “There’s always controversy around President Trump’s visits anywhere. That’s part of the deal with President Trump.”

Khan and Trump have history. In 2016, the U.S. president challenged Khan to an IQ test after the mayor said the president’s views on Islam are “ignorant.”

Following the terrorist attack on London Bridge in 2017, the president accused Khan of “pathetic” behaviour. He's also said Khan has “done a very bad job on terrorism.”

Trump’s tweet Monday also alluded to a controversy over the weekend in which he denied calling American actress-turned-Duchess Meghan Markle “nasty,” despite there being audio of him saying just that. He is set to dine with the royal family Monday afternoon, but Markle, who gave birth last month, is not expected during the week’s ceremonies.

Upon landing, Trump also took a shot at CNN, the network whose coverage he has often complained is unfair to his administration, venting that the network ""is the primary source of news available from the U.S."" and writing that he had to turn the channel off. He went on to suggest that the network's parent company, AT&T, ""do something"" about CNN's coverage.

""Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Matteo Salvini in Italy, Marine Le Pen in France and Nigel Farage here in the UK are using the same divisive tropes of the fascists of the 20th century to garner support, but with new sinister methods to deliver their message. And they are gaining ground and winning power and influence in places that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.”

Speaking to the BBC after greeting Trump on the tarmac at Stansted Airport, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the president had talked about Khan during their brief exchange.

“He mentioned to me some of his feelings about the Mayor of London which he subsequently tweeted out so it was obviously on his mind,” said Hunt.

“I think if you look at his tweet, he wasn’t going to be inviting Sadiq Khan for the sort of royal treatment at the White House any time soon,” he added.

The foreign secretary said he had told the president that the U.K. would put on ""a great show"" for him. Asked if he is worried that Trump would ignite further controversy, he said: “There’s always controversy around President Trump’s visits anywhere. That’s part of the deal with President Trump.”

Khan and Trump have history. In 2016, the U.S. president challenged Khan to an IQ test after the mayor said the president’s views on Islam are “ignorant.”

Following the terrorist attack on London Bridge in 2017, the president accused Khan of “pathetic” behaviour. He's also said Khan has “done a very bad job on terrorism.”

Trump’s tweet Monday also alluded to a controversy over the weekend in which he denied calling American actress-turned-Duchess Meghan Markle “nasty,” despite there being audio of him saying just that. He is set to dine with the royal family Monday afternoon, but Markle, who gave birth last month, is not expected during the week’s ceremonies.

Upon landing, Trump also took a shot at CNN, the network whose coverage he has often complained is unfair to his administration, venting that the network ""is the primary source of news available from the U.S."" and writing that he had to turn the channel off. He went on to suggest that the network's parent company, AT&T, ""do something"" about CNN's coverage.

""All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop,"" he wrote.","U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media before leaving the White House on June 2 | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Trump calls London mayor ‘stone cold loser’ before landing in UK Sadiq Khan ‘reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC,’ US president says.

391,Trump announces departure of chief economist Hassett,Victoria Guida,"Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, will leave the Trump administration, President Donald Trump announced Sunday | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Trump announces departure of chief economist Hassett ‘Kevin Hassett, who has done such a great job for me and the Administration, will be leaving shortly,’ Trump says in a tweet.

President Donald Trump announced Sunday night that Kevin Hassett, his chief economist and a prominent promoter of the president’s tax cuts, will be stepping down from his position, with a replacement to be named soon.

“Kevin Hassett, who has done such a great job for me and the Administration, will be leaving shortly,” Trump, who is visiting the U.K., said in a tweet. “His very talented replacement will be named as soon as I get back to the U.S. I want to thank Kevin for all he has done - he is a true friend!”

Hassett, who was confirmed as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in September 2017, has been one of the more traditionally conservative voices in the White House and one of the few prominent economists in Trump’s circle.

Known for his consistently upbeat demeanor, he strongly supported Trump's idea that the economy can achieve a sustained 3 percent annual growth.

More recently, he helped Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, write the president’s new immigration plan, unveiled last month, which is still being put into bill form. The emerging legislation, which boosts security at the southern border and pushes the nation to admit more high-skilled, well-educated immigrants, rather than immigrants who enter the U.S. based on family ties, is expected to be released in the coming days.

Hassett, a former scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wasn’t a perfect fit for Trump’s ideology, given his free-trade inclinations and his past writings on the benefits of immigration. But he avoided becoming the target of Trump’s wrath during his tenure.

The Council of Economic Advisers serves as the in-house economic analysis operation for the White House. It helps produce the annual Economic Report of the President and serves as the main liaison between the West Wing and the economic data offices at the labor and commerce departments and other federal agencies.

Hassett’s replacement will have to be confirmed by the Senate.

Trump will return to the U.S. next weekend.

392,"Ahead of Trump state visit, it’s déjà-UK all over again",Quint Forgey,"The media blitz by Trump comes as British officials prepare to roll out the red carpet for the first family, despite criticism from some local leaders | Jack Taylor/WPA Pool via Getty Images Ahead of Trump state visit, it’s déjà-UK all over again The U.S. president’s press foray into Brexit and other domestic matters recalls contentious remarks he made when last in Britain.

LONDON — On the eve of his first state visit, President Donald Trump is giving British officials reason to believe this latest overseas trip will be no different from his disruptive foray into local politics when he was there last July.

The normally unpredictable president provoked déjà vu on Saturday when he granted an explosive interview to The Sun, a newspaper owned by Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch. Weighing in on a series of British issues, Trump insisted that the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, could have “built up a big advantage” for the U.K. during Brexit negotiations if only she had heeded his advice, and he described Meghan Markle, an American actress who became the Duchess of Sussex upon marrying Prince Harry last May, as “nasty” for once referring to him as misogynistic. In a subsequent tweet, Trump claimed his comment was taken out of context.

The interview, which was published just 48 hours before Trump is set to arrive in Britain on Monday morning and nearly a year after he dismissed The Sun as “fake news” after his first interview with the British tabloid — which included repeated jabs at May and a threat to cancel trade talks if she pursued a “soft Brexit” deal — shattered diplomatic protocol.

This time, though, Trump’s pre-arrival media strategy stretched beyond a single outlet.

The American leader and his national security adviser, John Bolton, have given separate interviews to at least four local outlets ahead of the visit, touching on subjects such as Brexit and Iran and attempting to turn the search for May’s successor into a trans-Atlantic race. All of it comes just a week after Trump faced widespread criticism for contentious comments about North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, during a state visit to Japan.

“It’s very much the president’s style,” said Nile Gardiner, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher and a foreign policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “It’s quite controversial and perhaps unusual.”

Some, like Gardiner, see a strategy behind Trump’s comments — even if they’ve set the stage for a series of awkward encounters with May and the royal family. Trump will spend time with Queen Elizabeth II during his visit, in addition to meeting Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall; Prince William and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge; and Prince Harry, whose wife, Markle, will be absent after having recently given birth.

“I think the president sees a big U.S. national interest in the success of Brexit, and so he’s wading into the debate because of what is at stake,” Gardiner told POLITICO, describing Trump’s approach as “pragmatic.”

In a norm-breaking move, Trump told The Sun he supported former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a longtime Brexiteer, in his bid to succeed May, whom he simultaneously accused of allowing “the European Union to have all the cards” during negotiations over the Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc.

“I had mentioned to Theresa that you have got to build up your ammunition,” Trump said, claiming that May failed to give the E.U. “anything to lose.”

Trump made headlines again over the weekend in a wide-ranging interview with The Sunday Times . This time, he encouraged May’s successor to refuse to pay a “divorce” settlement to the E.U. and to “sue” Brussels in order to gain leverage during Brexit talks. Trump also said the Brexit Party’s leader, Nigel Farage, with whom he’s met several times, should be involved in the deal-making process; threatened to halt intelligence sharing with Britain if government officials grant the Chinese telecom company Huawei access to the country’s first 5G network; and said he would have to be better acquainted with Jeremy Corbyn, a staunch Trump critic, before sharing U.S. intelligence with the U.K. if the Labour leader were prime minister.

Trump’s comments about the leadership race and Brexit — two of the most sensitive political topics inside Britain — were hardly a surprise to anyone who caught Bolton’s interviews. The national security adviser conducted a series of meetings in the U.K. last week in preparation for Trump’s arrival, though a National Security Council spokesperson declined to tell POLITICO with whom Bolton met or what topics he discussed.

Asked by Britain’s Sky News last week whether Trump should withhold his opinions on Brexit and the Conservative leadership contest, Bolton responded: “The president will do what the president wants.”

He told the The Daily Telegraph in another interview that Britain’s departure from the E.U. would have a positive effect on global politics and longstanding military alliances

“As a separate nation again, Britain’s impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater,” Bolton said. “I think it will help us in NATO in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help NATO be more effective, and that has to be a plus.”

The media blitz by Trump and Bolton comes as British officials prepare to roll out the red carpet for the first family, despite criticism from some local leaders. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said on Sunday that it was “un-British” to greet Trump with the extraordinary degree of pomp and pageantry that comes with a state visit.

“In years to come, I suspect this state visit will be one we look back on with profound regret,” Khan wrote in an op-ed for The Observer.

Trump will spend three days in the U.K. with his wife, Melania, and adult children before traveling to Ireland and France for bilateral meetings and a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings. He is likely to wade into Brexit politics and the search for Britain’s next prime minister once more on Tuesday, when he and May are due to participate in a joint news conference after their final meeting during her tenure at 10 Downing Street.","The media blitz by Trump comes as British officials prepare to roll out the red carpet for the first family, despite criticism from some local leaders | Jack Taylor/WPA Pool via Getty Images Ahead of Trump state visit, it’s déjà-UK all over again The U.S. president’s press foray into Brexit and other domestic matters recalls contentious remarks he made when last in Britain.

393,Now Macron really is the president of the rich,John Lichfield,"PARIS — Forget Emmanuel Macron’s idea of a “Jupiterian” presidency. The French leader has become an Achilles, an all-conquering hero with a potentially fatal, hidden weakness.

Macron has been playing a dangerous game: By turning last week’s European Parliament election into a duel with the far right, he turned his party into the only alternative to the populists.

This strategy, which allows Macron to suck votes from the center left and center right, has led a number of pundits to already predict his victory in 2022, when France goes back to the polls to elect a new president.

But look at the small print of how and where people voted in last week’s election, and you’ll see why Macron’s strategists should instead be worried. The resignation on Sunday of Laurent Wauquiez, the leader of the center-right Les Républicains party, is another clue.

The obvious — but insufficient — answer to the question of who “won” the European election last week, is Marine Le Pen. The far-right leader’s National Rally took 23.3 percent of the vote, just ahead of Macron’s “Renaissance” list with 22.4 percent.

There was also an unexpected, and significant, swing to the Greens, who won 13.4 percent. No other party reached double figures.

The result was embarrassing for Macron, but the real threat to his presidency lies elsewhere. Like Achilles, he is vulnerable in an unexpected way.

Although Macron’s 2019 voter base (22.4 percent) is almost exactly the same size as his 2017 voter base (24.1 percent), the difference is that his party is no longer France’s “new center.” It is metamorphosing into a new center right.

In commune after commune, Macron racked up high scores in well-heeled, bourgeois areas that until recently were the fiefdoms of conservative heavyweights and former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy.

In 2017, Macron was, in spirit at least, the candidate of a young, optimistic, aspirational France. Exit polls last Sunday showed a shift in Macron’s voter base from the center to the center right, from the aspirational to the wealthy, from the young to the old.

A survey of voters by Ipsos-Sopra Steria showed that 27 percent of people who voted for the center right in the first round in 2017’s presidential election decided to cast their ballot for Macron in last week’s European election. Simultaneously, 14 percent of Macron first-round voters cast their ballot for the Greens and 11 percent went with the center left.

His highest score in last week’s election — 33 percent — was among people over 70, as younger, metropolitan ex-Macron voters moved to the Greens in droves. He lost 6 percentage points among 18- to 24-year-olds and 11 points among voters aged 25 to 34.

Most strikingly, Macron’s list piled up scores over 40 percent in wealthier western arrondissements of Paris and suburbs like Neuilly-sur-Seine, the wealthiest commune in France. The poorer, younger, more bourgeois-bohemian eastern parts of Paris migrated massively from Macron to the Greens and the center left.

The danger is that his new base — the 20 percent plus that he’ll need to reach the second round of the presidential vote in 2022 — no longer fits the trade description of Macronism, which, like him, is supposed to be young, energetic and mold-breaking.

This is what makes him uniquely vulnerable: His base is at risk of being squeezed if Les Républicains — the “old center right” that his election nearly annihilated — comes back to life ahead of the presidential election.

The old conservative-Gaullist party may not look like much of a threat at the moment. The political family that dominated French politics for 60 years until Macron’s victory in 2017 got a lamentable 8.48 percent of the vote in last week’s election.

But Macron can’t rest easy.

Les Républicains' abject rout prompted the controversial Laurent Wauquiez to quit as party leader on Sunday, calling the election results a ""failure."" This gives the center-right party an opportunity — an imperative, some might say — to reconstruct itself over the next three years under new leadership and rid itself of the lingering aftertaste of the financial scandals, internal warfare and ideological wandering of the Sarkozy and post-Sarkozy years.

A couple of sidelined center-right leaders — Valérie Pecresse, the president of the Ile de France region, and Xavier Bertrand, the president of the northern Hauts de France region — will fancy their chances of reinventing the Gaullist tradition as something more conservative and even in more respects more centrist than “Macronomics.”

The results of last week’s European poll suggest that a large segment of the young, metropolitan, leftist and ecologically minded electorate wants a new kind of politics. They no longer believe that Macron will provide it.

Without them, the president will need to hold on to his new conservative and new old voters to survive the first round in 2022.

Much will depend on what happens with the French economy. If it continues its modest revival, all should be well for Macron. Unemployment has fallen to 8.4 percent, the lowest for 10 years.

But if it stumbles in the next three years, he could be in trouble.

Macron’s strategy has been too successful. By blowing up the Wauquiez Républicains, he has cleared the space for a dangerous new rival in 2022.

This strategy, which allows Macron to suck votes from the center left and center right, has led a number of pundits to already predict his victory in 2022, when France goes back to the polls to elect a new president.

But look at the small print of how and where people voted in last week’s election, and you’ll see why Macron’s strategists should instead be worried. The resignation on Sunday of Laurent Wauquiez, the leader of the center-right Les Républicains party, is another clue.

The obvious — but insufficient — answer to the question of who “won” the European election last week, is Marine Le Pen. The far-right leader’s National Rally took 23.3 percent of the vote, just ahead of Macron’s “Renaissance” list with 22.4 percent.

There was also an unexpected, and significant, swing to the Greens, who won 13.4 percent. No other party reached double figures.

The result was embarrassing for Macron, but the real threat to his presidency lies elsewhere. Like Achilles, he is vulnerable in an unexpected way.

Although Macron’s 2019 voter base (22.4 percent) is almost exactly the same size as his 2017 voter base (24.1 percent), the difference is that his party is no longer France’s “new center.” It is metamorphosing into a new center right.

In commune after commune, Macron racked up high scores in well-heeled, bourgeois areas that until recently were the fiefdoms of conservative heavyweights and former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy.

In 2017, Macron was, in spirit at least, the candidate of a young, optimistic, aspirational France. Exit polls last Sunday showed a shift in Macron’s voter base from the center to the center right, from the aspirational to the wealthy, from the young to the old.

A survey of voters by Ipsos-Sopra Steria showed that 27 percent of people who voted for the center right in the first round in 2017’s presidential election decided to cast their ballot for Macron in last week’s European election. Simultaneously, 14 percent of Macron first-round voters cast their ballot for the Greens and 11 percent went with the center left.

His highest score in last week’s election — 33 percent — was among people over 70, as younger, metropolitan ex-Macron voters moved to the Greens in droves. He lost 6 percentage points among 18- to 24-year-olds and 11 points among voters aged 25 to 34.

Most strikingly, Macron’s list piled up scores over 40 percent in wealthier western arrondissements of Paris and suburbs like Neuilly-sur-Seine, the wealthiest commune in France. The poorer, younger, more bourgeois-bohemian eastern parts of Paris migrated massively from Macron to the Greens and the center left.

The danger is that his new base — the 20 percent plus that he’ll need to reach the second round of the presidential vote in 2022 — no longer fits the trade description of Macronism, which, like him, is supposed to be young, energetic and mold-breaking.

This is what makes him uniquely vulnerable: His base is at risk of being squeezed if Les Républicains — the “old center right” that his election nearly annihilated — comes back to life ahead of the presidential election.

The old conservative-Gaullist party may not look like much of a threat at the moment. The political family that dominated French politics for 60 years until Macron’s victory in 2017 got a lamentable 8.48 percent of the vote in last week’s election.

But Macron can’t rest easy.

Les Républicains' abject rout prompted the controversial Laurent Wauquiez to quit as party leader on Sunday, calling the election results a ""failure."" This gives the center-right party an opportunity — an imperative, some might say — to reconstruct itself over the next three years under new leadership and rid itself of the lingering aftertaste of the financial scandals, internal warfare and ideological wandering of the Sarkozy and post-Sarkozy years.

A couple of sidelined center-right leaders — Valérie Pecresse, the president of the Ile de France region, and Xavier Bertrand, the president of the northern Hauts de France region — will fancy their chances of reinventing the Gaullist tradition as something more conservative and even in more respects more centrist than “Macronomics.”

The results of last week’s European poll suggest that a large segment of the young, metropolitan, leftist and ecologically minded electorate wants a new kind of politics. They no longer believe that Macron will provide it.

Without them, the president will need to hold on to his new conservative and new old voters to survive the first round in 2022.

Much will depend on what happens with the French economy. If it continues its modest revival, all should be well for Macron. Unemployment has fallen to 8.4 percent, the lowest for 10 years.

But if it stumbles in the next three years, he could be in trouble.

Macron’s strategy has been too successful. By blowing up the Wauquiez Républicains, he has cleared the space for a dangerous new rival in 2022.

397,Romanian PM vows to drop judicial changes,Carmen Paun,"Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă said she will abandon controversial judicial reforms, signaling a change in direction for her party after its longtime leader was jailed last week.

Under Liviu Dragnea, long Romania's de facto leader, Dăncilă's Social Democrats (PSD) had pushed for a number of judicial changes, which were met with street protests and attracted rebuke from the European Commission as well as Western countries' embassies in Bucharest, which warned the measures could lead to a backsliding in the country's fight against high-level corruption.

But popular opinion has turned against these reforms: The party faced a drubbing in the European Parliament election, and a majority of Romanians voted in a non-binding referendum against the government being able to change judicial law through emergency decrees, as well as against the government granting amnesty or pardons for graft-related crimes.

Dragnea was sentenced the day after the votes to three and a half years in prison in a case involving fake jobs for party workers, and Dăncilă — once seen as a Dragnea loyalist — took over as interim leader.

Now, Dăncilă told POLITICO, she aims to put the PSD on a new path.

""This topic did a lot of harm to the party and polarized our society,"" Dăncilă said in a phone interview from Bucharest. ""I want the PSD to become a party of balance, and from now on, the justice subject does not exist on the government's agenda, but we will focus on areas of interest that are a priority for people, such as health, education and infrastructure.""

The PSD had previously pushed, for example, for an emergency decree on the criminal code that was expected to reduce the statute of limitations for multiple offenses, saying it is necessary to bring the code in line with a Constitutional Court decision. But critics argued the reform would be used to benefit Dragnea.

""I could not say that this agenda was linked only to Mr. Dragnea. There have been many issues that have appeared in the public space regarding actions against people who were proven innocent,"" Dăncilă said of the judicial reforms.

She added that while there should be a debate about the Romanian justice system, the PSD had perhaps taken that discussion too far.

""I think it's important to go back to normal, and that means belonging to PES"" — Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă

""I think politicians should not intervene in the justice system,"" she said.

The third PSD prime minister since the party returned to power in January 2017, Dăncilă was a member of the European Parliament when Dragnea picked her for the job. Asked whether she is now betraying Dragnea by pushing the party in a new direction, Dăncilă said one cannot speak of treason and touted the experience that got her the job.

""I have been a PSD member for 23 years. I went from being a simple member to being chairman of a local party organization, local councilor and then nine years as an MEP.""

Mending bridges

Dăncilă has already taken steps to cleanse the PSD of some of Dragnea's influence. In the week since she's become party leader, Dăncilă has fired two of her top advisers that were close to Dragnea. A meeting of the PSD leadership a day after Dragnea went to jail also purged some of Dragnea's loyalists, such as Codrin Ștefănescu, who was replaced as the party's secretary-general.

She's also looking to mend damaged relations in Brussels, heading there for two days on Monday to try to smooth over tensions caused by the judicial reform push with both the Commission and the Party of European Socialists.

She's due to meet with Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who wrote a letter in May threatening to take action against Romania, including potentially suspending its voting rights in the Council over the judicial system changes.

Dăncilă will also meet PES President Sergei Stanishev to discuss a potential thaw in relations after the PES froze ties with the Romanian party over rule-of-law concerns in April.

""I think it's important to go back to normal, and that means belonging to PES,"" Dăncilă said.

She added that she is confident she could repair damages to the relationship also caused by a lack of dialogue and Dragnea not taking part in many PES meetings in Brussels.

Democratizing the PSD

Dăncilă also wants the party's MPs to be able to decide for themselves how to vote on various issues based on the interests of their constituents, rather than following marching orders from the party leader.

""We will focus on integrity, meritocracy and transparency. I believe we will succeed and that the PSD will return to integrity,"" she said.

""I want to see a change, bringing democracy in the party and that we do what citizens want us to,"" she added.

""They believe that Liviu Dragnea's departure solved everything and they can go back to what they've been doing for the past 30 years"" — Dan Barna, president of the USR

But with the party still set to officially vote on a new leader this summer, it's unclear how much of her new agenda she'll be able to implement if she doesn't take the top spot. Dăncilă said she has not yet decided whether she will run, and many other members are now jostling for the party's presidency.

The PSD cannot change ""radically and fast,"" said Radu Magdin, a political consultant who has worked with the PSD before.

""In the medium term, they can change radically, but they need a strong leadership,"" he said. There were several attempts from within the PSD to take down Dragnea before he ultimately fell, but none succeeded because he had the support of a majority in the party, Magdin said. ""At the moment, it is very hard to cover a power vacuum that comes after a tight power grip, like Dragnea's.""

The party doesn't want to lose power and it will make all the changes it sees as necessary to project stability, especially for the people who voted for them, according to Magdin.

He also said quarreling between the opposition National Liberal Party and the USR Plus Alliance parties, who were the winners of the European election, will favor the PSD, despite the delicate situation it's facing. The two parties clashed during the campaign and have disagreed in recent days over tax breaks for people working in IT.

Ahead of the presidential election later this year and local and parliamentary elections next year, making it through the summer by promoting some uncontroversial public policies will be important for the PSD, Magdin said.

But Dan Barna, president of USR, cast doubt over whether the PSD leadership is now able to reform the party.

""If we look at who leads the PSD, there are a lot of people who have been with Liviu Dragnea over the last three years. The party has been transformed into a party of servants, the level of competence is ridiculous[ly low],"" he told POLITICO, echoing criticisms that other opponents of the PSD government have made.

400,"Uh-oh, there goes the GroKo",Matthew Karnitschnig,"BERLIN — Just when it looked like it was finally safe to ignore German politics again — BOOM!

Andrea Nahles’ decision to announce her resignation as leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) just after breakfast Sunday didn’t just ruin a sunny 30-plus degree day for Berlin’s press corps; it sent shudders across Europe’s political landscape.

Many in Europe have been hoping that Angela Merkel would manage to preserve her awkward “grand coalition” (or ""GroKo,"" to use the German shorthand) between the two traditional big parties until the end of its term in 2021. Indeed Merkel, who handed over the leadership of her Christian Democrats (CDU) to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in December and declared she wouldn’t seek public office again, has encouraged that speculation, repeating time and again that she sees no reason to leave the chancellery before then.

With the EU looking for new leaders of the European Commission, Council, Parliament and Central Bank in the coming months (and a way to somehow deal with Brexit and Donald Trump), the last thing the bloc needs is political uncertainty in its largest member state.

Notwithstanding a bit of turbulence in both the CDU and SPD of late, it actually started to look like Merkel might be able to hold things together. Or so her fans hoped.

Given the SPD’s deterioration since then, it’s a safe bet that rank-and-file Social Democrats are less enamored with the coalition than they were then.

In retrospect, that optimism seems like little more than wishful thinking. Looking closely, the signs of deep instability in the coalition should have been obvious. The Social Democrats’ collapse at the ballot box last month, both in the European election, where they recorded their worst-ever result, and in the city-state of Bremen, which they lost for the first time since the war, marks just the latest in a long series of setbacks that triggered Nahles’ exit.

The SPD’s death by a thousand cuts has been accompanied by the soaring fortunes of the Greens, who have more than doubled their support since the last federal election in 2017.

So where do Merkel and the GroKo go from here? Here are four possible scenarios.

1. Status quo ante

If the SPD can quickly get its act together by finding a new leader and someone to lead the party’s parliamentary group (preferably the same person) the grand coalition could continue (almost) as if nothing happened. After all, Nahles was not even a member of the Cabinet. For Merkel, Kramp-Karrenbauer and other CDU leaders, the keep-calm-and-carry-on approach is clearly the preferred option.

“We’re going to continue the government’s work,” Merkel said Sunday, highlighting the coalition’s packed agenda at home and in Europe.

The big question is whether the SPD will go along for the ride. Back in March last year, 66 percent of party members voted to join the Christian Democrats in another grand coalition, despite concerns that the party’s yearslong partnership with Merkel had robbed the SPD of its profile.

Given the SPD’s deterioration since then, it’s a safe bet that rank-and-file Social Democrats are less enamored with the coalition than they were then. Prominent opponents of the GroKo such as Kevin Kühnert, leader of the SPD’s youth wing, are likely to agitate for an exit from the coalition, a step that could ultimately lead to a new general election.

Whether the SPD leadership will endorse a course that is certain to thin the ranks of the party’s parliamentary group is another question. But with a string of regional elections on the horizon in eastern Germany in the fall, where the party is again expected to face heavy losses, it may have no choice.

Bottom line: The SPD leadership is likely to try to stay the GroKo course, but its prospects for success are shaky at best.

2. Jamaican state of mind

An SPD exit from the GroKo wouldn’t automatically trigger new elections. With the legislature less than two years into its term, Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is likely to push for a fresh coalition. That could open the door to a so-called Jamaica coalition (a play on the parties’ traditional colors). Such a combination would involve the Christian Democrats, the Greens and liberal Free Democrats. Merkel tried to put such a coalition together after the 2017 election but talks collapsed at the last minute when Free Democrat leader Christian Lindner pulled the plug for reasons he has never fully explained.

While there’s no doubt this would be the cleanest solution to a potential GroKo collapse, it would be tough to pull off. While both the Christian Democrats and Free Democrats have signaled they would be game, the Greens are now the weak link. Since the last election, the environmental party's popularity has soared — it won more than 20 percent of the German vote in the European election. Therefore, the party would have a strong incentive to demand a new general election to take advantage of its growing support. A poll released Saturday even predicted the party would finish first in a national election.

If the SPD pulls out of the coalition, the Christian Democrats could try to continue in power with a minority government.

Another stumbling block toward Jamaica is that it would require Merkel to step down because the Free Democrats have made clear they’d only be in once Merkel’s out. Yet the departure of a chancellor who remains the country’s most popular politician is arguably a more compelling reason to call a new election than a GroKo collapse. Many would contend that forming a new government without Merkel as chancellor would need a new mandate from the people.

Bottom line: Germany may yet get to Jamaica, but not before a new election.

3. Minority report

If the SPD pulls out of the coalition, the Christian Democrats could try to continue in power with a minority government. This would require them to build coalitions on an ad-hoc basis. But such arrangements are by definition unstable — a state of affairs that is anathema to stability-obsessed Germans. Merkel has said previously that a minority government could only be considered as an interim fix.

Bottom line: Germany isn’t Italy.

4. Let the voters decide

Anyone who follows German politics up close can’t escape the end-of-an-era atmosphere. Sure, Merkel’s as popular as ever but she’s not engaging much in domestic politics (which probably explains her popularity). As she illustrated again last week in her Harvard address, she sounds like a politician thinking mainly about legacy.

But it’s not just that Merkel has one foot out the door. Germany’s political firmament is in upheaval, mainly due to the surge of the Greens. While the SPD is bearing the brunt of the Green wave, the Christian Democrats are feeling it too. With the German debate over environmental policy reaching a fever pitch and the future of Europe hanging in the balance, giving voters another crack at the ballot box may be the only way forward.

401,"Uh-oh, there goes the GroKo",Joshua Posaner,"BERLIN — Just when it looked like it was finally safe to ignore German politics again — BOOM!

Andrea Nahles’ decision to announce her resignation as leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) just after breakfast Sunday didn’t just ruin a sunny 30-plus degree day for Berlin’s press corps; it sent shudders across Europe’s political landscape.

Many in Europe have been hoping that Angela Merkel would manage to preserve her awkward “grand coalition” (or ""GroKo,"" to use the German shorthand) between the two traditional big parties until the end of its term in 2021. Indeed Merkel, who handed over the leadership of her Christian Democrats (CDU) to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in December and declared she wouldn’t seek public office again, has encouraged that speculation, repeating time and again that she sees no reason to leave the chancellery before then.

With the EU looking for new leaders of the European Commission, Council, Parliament and Central Bank in the coming months (and a way to somehow deal with Brexit and Donald Trump), the last thing the bloc needs is political uncertainty in its largest member state.

Notwithstanding a bit of turbulence in both the CDU and SPD of late, it actually started to look like Merkel might be able to hold things together. Or so her fans hoped.

Given the SPD’s deterioration since then, it’s a safe bet that rank-and-file Social Democrats are less enamored with the coalition than they were then.

In retrospect, that optimism seems like little more than wishful thinking. Looking closely, the signs of deep instability in the coalition should have been obvious. The Social Democrats’ collapse at the ballot box last month, both in the European election, where they recorded their worst-ever result, and in the city-state of Bremen, which they lost for the first time since the war, marks just the latest in a long series of setbacks that triggered Nahles’ exit.

The SPD’s death by a thousand cuts has been accompanied by the soaring fortunes of the Greens, who have more than doubled their support since the last federal election in 2017.

So where do Merkel and the GroKo go from here? Here are four possible scenarios.

1. Status quo ante

If the SPD can quickly get its act together by finding a new leader and someone to lead the party’s parliamentary group (preferably the same person) the grand coalition could continue (almost) as if nothing happened. After all, Nahles was not even a member of the Cabinet. For Merkel, Kramp-Karrenbauer and other CDU leaders, the keep-calm-and-carry-on approach is clearly the preferred option.

“We’re going to continue the government’s work,” Merkel said Sunday, highlighting the coalition’s packed agenda at home and in Europe.

The big question is whether the SPD will go along for the ride. Back in March last year, 66 percent of party members voted to join the Christian Democrats in another grand coalition, despite concerns that the party’s yearslong partnership with Merkel had robbed the SPD of its profile.

Given the SPD’s deterioration since then, it’s a safe bet that rank-and-file Social Democrats are less enamored with the coalition than they were then. Prominent opponents of the GroKo such as Kevin Kühnert, leader of the SPD’s youth wing, are likely to agitate for an exit from the coalition, a step that could ultimately lead to a new general election.

Whether the SPD leadership will endorse a course that is certain to thin the ranks of the party’s parliamentary group is another question. But with a string of regional elections on the horizon in eastern Germany in the fall, where the party is again expected to face heavy losses, it may have no choice.

Bottom line: The SPD leadership is likely to try to stay the GroKo course, but its prospects for success are shaky at best.

404,Pompeo offers to talk to Iran with ‘no pre-conditions’,Nahal Toosi,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo | Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images Pompeo offers to talk to Iran with ‘no pre-conditions’ His remarks suggest increased flexibility by the Trump administration.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to avoid a war with Iran appears to be prevailing in his own administration — for now.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is willing to talk to Iran’s Islamist leaders without preconditions, even as the U.S. deploys hundreds more troops to the region amid rising tensions.

“We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions, we are ready to sit down,” Pompeo said.

While Pompeo added the U.S. still wants Iran to behave like a “normal nation,” his overall remarks appeared to be a climbdown from the past, including his insistence that Tehran meet 12 far-reaching conditions as part of any deal. Pompeo is known for his closeness to Trump and willingness to adjust his own messaging to fall in line with the president’s thinking.

His announcement followed reports that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had said Tehran would talk to the Americans if they show “respect” instead of issuing orders. Iranian officials previously had ruled out talks with the Trump team.

Taken together, the developments suggest that international efforts, either publicly or behind the scenes, to convince the two sides to de-escalate tensions are having an effect. Pompeo spoke while visiting Switzerland, which often serves as an intermediary between the U.S. and Iran, though the Swiss have been unwilling to details what role, if any, they now play.

The statements from both sides also come as Trump has made it increasingly clear that he does not want a military conflict with Iran. His stance has put him publicly at odds with aides such as Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, who have taken a harder line.

Bolton has been especially bellicose, even though it has strained his relationship with Trump. He has threatened Iran with “unrelenting force,” and in recent days blamed Iran for a spate of attacks on U.S. allies, including drone attacks carried out by Houthi rebels on targets in Saudi Arabia.

Pompeo has been more cautious, indicating he’s trying to channel the president, an effort that is not easy given Trump’s mercurial nature.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.

Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said the Trump administration is asking Iran to believe both that the U.S. will be very hard line and that it doesn’t want war. “It remains to be seen if that combination represents a viable basis for talks,” he said. “Certainly, skepticism is in order.”

Trump ran for office in 2016 pledging to reduce U.S. entanglements abroad. He’s reached out to Iranian leaders in the past, such as during the 2017 U.N. General Assembly, only to be rebuffed, and even as early as July 2018 said he’d be willing to talk to Iran without pre-conditions.

More recently, however, Trump has appeared to effectively dismiss the 12 conditions Pompeo had placed on Iran for any serious negotiations to take place.

Those conditions included everything from Iran ending its support for militias outside its borders to halting its ballistic missile program. They were so far-reaching that analysts said they were essentially a call for regime change.

Trump, however, has said in recent weeks that he’s only interested in making sure Iran never obtains nuclear weapons. “We aren’t looking for regime change,” Trump said this past week while in Tokyo. “I just want to make that clear. We are looking for no nuclear weapons.”

The president also stressed that if Iran and the United States could come to an acceptable agreement, the U.S. would be able to help Iran save its economy, which has been battered by American sanctions.

The mixed signals from Trump and his team have frustrated Middle Eastern officials, Democratic lawmakers and other observers of the region, some of whom fear that even if both sides don’t want a war, a miscalculation could lead to it.

Critics note that many of the tensions today stem from Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015. That deal lifted many U.S. sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran shuttering its nuclear program.

In the past, Trump has complained that the 2015 deal didn’t do enough to restrain Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior, including its support for terrorist groups. His more recent comments suggest he’s willing to make essentially the same kind of deal.

“I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal,” he said while in Tokyo. “And I think that’s very smart of them. And I think that’s a possibility to happen also.”

According to reports that quoted Iranian state media, Rouhani, the country’s president, said Saturday: “We are for logic and talks if [the other side] sits respectfully at the negotiating table and follows international regulations, not if it issues an order to negotiate.”

It’s not at all clear that Iran will view Pompeo’s latest offer as showing enough respect, or whether it will believe Trump’s words given his actions toward Tehran. In an interview with ABC‘s “This Week,“ Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran isn’t likely to negotiate with the United States.

“It's not very likely because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure,” he said. “He's imposing pressure. This may work in a real estate market. It does not work in dealing with Iran.”

The president has levied extremely tough sanctions on Iran, badly damaging its economy, even threatening other countries with sanctions if they keep buying oil from Iran. He also decided to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — a government body — as a terrorist group, a move some believe has contributed to the recent tensions.

Even as he’s said he wants to talk to the Iranians, Trump approved a decision last month to speed up the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, in response to alleged Iranian threats against U.S. troops and facilities in the region.

Days ago, he deployed or extended the tours of some 1,500 U.S. troops to the region amid suspicions that Iran was behind attacks on oil and related infrastructure of U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia.

Trump administration officials say this “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran is designed to cut off its funding so that it cannot support militia or terrorist activity outside its borders, eventually forcing it to come to the table for talks.

Officially, the administration’s position is that it is not seeking regime change in Iran, but rather a change in the regime’s behavior. There are some in the administration, however, who hope that economic conditions will become so dire that the Iranian people will rise up and overthrow their Islamist rulers.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to avoid a war with Iran appears to be prevailing in his own administration — for now.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is willing to talk to Iran’s Islamist leaders without preconditions, even as the U.S. deploys hundreds more troops to the region amid rising tensions.

“We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions, we are ready to sit down,” Pompeo said.

While Pompeo added the U.S. still wants Iran to behave like a “normal nation,” his overall remarks appeared to be a climbdown from the past, including his insistence that Tehran meet 12 far-reaching conditions as part of any deal. Pompeo is known for his closeness to Trump and willingness to adjust his own messaging to fall in line with the president’s thinking.

His announcement followed reports that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had said Tehran would talk to the Americans if they show “respect” instead of issuing orders. Iranian officials previously had ruled out talks with the Trump team.

Taken together, the developments suggest that international efforts, either publicly or behind the scenes, to convince the two sides to de-escalate tensions are having an effect. Pompeo spoke while visiting Switzerland, which often serves as an intermediary between the U.S. and Iran, though the Swiss have been unwilling to details what role, if any, they now play.

The statements from both sides also come as Trump has made it increasingly clear that he does not want a military conflict with Iran. His stance has put him publicly at odds with aides such as Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, who have taken a harder line.

Bolton has been especially bellicose, even though it has strained his relationship with Trump. He has threatened Iran with “unrelenting force,” and in recent days blamed Iran for a spate of attacks on U.S. allies, including drone attacks carried out by Houthi rebels on targets in Saudi Arabia.

Pompeo has been more cautious, indicating he’s trying to channel the president, an effort that is not easy given Trump’s mercurial nature.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.

Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said the Trump administration is asking Iran to believe both that the U.S. will be very hard line and that it doesn’t want war. “It remains to be seen if that combination represents a viable basis for talks,” he said. “Certainly, skepticism is in order.”

Trump ran for office in 2016 pledging to reduce U.S. entanglements abroad. He’s reached out to Iranian leaders in the past, such as during the 2017 U.N. General Assembly, only to be rebuffed, and even as early as July 2018 said he’d be willing to talk to Iran without pre-conditions.

More recently, however, Trump has appeared to effectively dismiss the 12 conditions Pompeo had placed on Iran for any serious negotiations to take place.

Those conditions included everything from Iran ending its support for militias outside its borders to halting its ballistic missile program. They were so far-reaching that analysts said they were essentially a call for regime change.

Trump, however, has said in recent weeks that he’s only interested in making sure Iran never obtains nuclear weapons. “We aren’t looking for regime change,” Trump said this past week while in Tokyo. “I just want to make that clear. We are looking for no nuclear weapons.”

The president also stressed that if Iran and the United States could come to an acceptable agreement, the U.S. would be able to help Iran save its economy, which has been battered by American sanctions.

The mixed signals from Trump and his team have frustrated Middle Eastern officials, Democratic lawmakers and other observers of the region, some of whom fear that even if both sides don’t want a war, a miscalculation could lead to it.

Critics note that many of the tensions today stem from Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015. That deal lifted many U.S. sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran shuttering its nuclear program.

In the past, Trump has complained that the 2015 deal didn’t do enough to restrain Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior, including its support for terrorist groups. His more recent comments suggest he’s willing to make essentially the same kind of deal.

“I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal,” he said while in Tokyo. “And I think that’s very smart of them. And I think that’s a possibility to happen also.”

According to reports that quoted Iranian state media, Rouhani, the country’s president, said Saturday: “We are for logic and talks if [the other side] sits respectfully at the negotiating table and follows international regulations, not if it issues an order to negotiate.”

It’s not at all clear that Iran will view Pompeo’s latest offer as showing enough respect, or whether it will believe Trump’s words given his actions toward Tehran. In an interview with ABC‘s “This Week,“ Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran isn’t likely to negotiate with the United States.

“It's not very likely because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure,” he said. “He's imposing pressure. This may work in a real estate market. It does not work in dealing with Iran.”

The president has levied extremely tough sanctions on Iran, badly damaging its economy, even threatening other countries with sanctions if they keep buying oil from Iran. He also decided to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — a government body — as a terrorist group, a move some believe has contributed to the recent tensions.

Even as he’s said he wants to talk to the Iranians, Trump approved a decision last month to speed up the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, in response to alleged Iranian threats against U.S. troops and facilities in the region.

Days ago, he deployed or extended the tours of some 1,500 U.S. troops to the region amid suspicions that Iran was behind attacks on oil and related infrastructure of U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia.

Trump administration officials say this “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran is designed to cut off its funding so that it cannot support militia or terrorist activity outside its borders, eventually forcing it to come to the table for talks.

Officially, the administration’s position is that it is not seeking regime change in Iran, but rather a change in the regime’s behavior. There are some in the administration, however, who hope that economic conditions will become so dire that the Iranian people will rise up and overthrow their Islamist rulers.

Sebastian Kurz may have just lost a vote of confidence, but new polls show he could ultimately end up Austria's chancellor again.

A survey conducted for Austria's Krone newspaper showed Kurz's center-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) at 38 percent, compared to the 31.5 percent the party won in the October 2017 national election. The Social Democrats followed with 21 percent, compared to 26.9 percent in 2017.

The poll was conducted last week between Wednesday and Friday — days after Kurz was ousted as chancellor in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. The vote was held after Kurz's coalition government between the ÖVP and far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) collapsed over the so-called Ibiza affair: A video emerged showing then vice chancellor and FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache meeting a woman he believed to be the wealthy niece of a Russian oligarch ahead of the 2017 election and attempting to trade lucrative public contracts for campaign support from her.

With a snap election now set for September, the poll published Sunday shows the FPÖ's support has dropped to 19 percent, down from the 26 percent they won in 2017.

Another poll published late last week also shows Kurz's party may be the biggest winner after the Ibiza affair. Demox Research found that the Austrian People's Party is at 37.5 percent, polling 3.5 percentage points higher than at the beginning of May, before the scandal broke.

The Social Democrats are at 22.5 percent, down 4.5 percentage points from the beginning of the month, while the Freedom Party is at 18.5 percent, down 3.5 percentage points, according to the Demox poll.

Both polls show that the liberal NEOS party and the Greens are also making gains, though still polling in fourth and fifth place, respectively.

411,Assange won’t face charges over role in devastating CIA leak,Natasha Bertrand,"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will not face charges for publishing Vault 7, a series of documents detailing the CIA’s arsenal of digital code used to hack devices | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Assange won’t face charges over role in devastating CIA leak The decision surprised national security experts and some former officials, given prosecutors’ recent decision to go after the WikiLeaks founder on Espionage Act charges.

The U.S. Justice Department has decided not to charge Julian Assange for his role in exposing some of the CIA’s most secret spying tools, according to a U.S. official and two other people familiar with the case.

It’s a move that has surprised national security experts and some former officials, given prosecutors’ recent decision to aggressively go after the WikiLeaks founder on more controversial Espionage Act charges that some legal experts said would not hold up in court. The decision also means that Assange will not face punishment for publishing one of the CIA’s most potent arsenals of digital code used to hack devices, dubbed Vault 7. The leak — one of the most devastating in CIA history — not only essentially rendered those tools useless for the CIA, it gave foreign spies and rogue hackers access to them.

Prosecutors were stymied by several factors.

First, the government is facing a ticking clock in its efforts to extradite Assange to the United States from the United Kingdom, where he is being held. Extradition laws require the U.S. to bring any additional charges against Assange within 60 days of the first indictment, which prosecutors filed in March, accusing Assange of helping former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning hack into military computers.

Second, prosecutors were worried about the sensitivity of the Vault 7 materials, according to an official familiar with the deliberations over whether to charge Assange. Broaching such a classified subject in court risks exposing even more CIA secrets, legal experts said. The CIA has never officially confirmed the authenticity of the leaked documents, even though analysts widely believe them to be authentic.

Just several months ago, numerous experts felt confident that prosecutors would also hit Assange with charges over Vault 7.

“There is no question that there are leak cases that can’t be prosecuted against the leaker or the leakee because the information is so sensitive that, for your proof at trial, you would have to confirm it is authentic,” said Mary McCord, who was acting assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department until 2017. “So the irony, often, is that the higher the classification of the leaked material, the harder it is to prosecute.”

So instead, the Justice Department will go after Assange on the one count for allegedly assisting Manning and the 17-count Espionage Act indictment. There are no plans to bring any additional indictments prior to his extradition.

While the Manning leak indictment was an expected move, the Espionage Act charges startled the legal community as a potential precedent-setting action. Traditionally, the law has been used to punish government officials who reveal classified information, not the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information. Press freedom activists immediately warned that the case could criminalize everyday journalistic behavior, such as soliciting sensitive information from government sources.

Federal officials insist they have a strong case, arguing that Assange is not a journalist and intentionally published the names of confidential sources in war zones over the objections of national security officials.

“There is a comfort level within the national security establishment of where the charges ended up,” the U.S. national security official told POLITICO.

Still, just several months ago, numerous experts felt confident that prosecutors would also hit Assange with charges over Vault 7. Prominent national security journalist Marcy Wheeler predicted in February that DOJ would “very clearly go after Assange” for the Vault 7 disclosure, and that a sealed indictment against him in the Eastern District of Virginia was likely related to that leak — the CIA is, after all, headquartered in Virginia, as ABC noted. Assange himself reportedly expressed concern that prosecutors would charge him with crimes related to Vault 7.

DOJ has charged one person in the Vault 7 theft. A former CIA employee, Joshua Schulte, was indicted for transmitting the Vault 7 documents to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is set for November. In April, prosecutors in his case asked the judge to keep the search warrants confidential because disseminating them could “impede ongoing investigations,” prompting more speculation over potential charges against Assange.

“Going after Assange for the Vault 7 leak would seem to involve more serious misconduct and have fewer” press freedom implications, said Carl Tobias, the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond Law School in Virginia. He noted that authorities have mechanisms, like redaction and judge reviews, to protect sensitive information.

But prosecutors have not accused Assange of coaxing Schulte to release the CIA tools, as they allege Assange did with Manning. According to court documents, Assange asked Manning for specific classified documents and advised her on how to hack into a government computer.

Manning is in jail over her refusal to testify before a grand jury in the Assange case. Her lawyers have argued that if the Justice Department does not intend to bring further charges against Assange, the previous need for her testimony should be rendered moot.

“If indeed the government has concluded their investigation, then there is no further need to coerce her compliance with the grand jury, and thus, there can be no legitimate ongoing reason to hold her in contempt,” Moira Meltzer-Cohen, an attorney for Manning, told POLITICO. “If the investigation has ended, then Chelsea must be released.""

WikiLeaks began releasing the Vault 7 documents in April 2017, prompting then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to slam the organization as a “hostile intelligence service.”

The exposed documents describe how the CIA’s secretive Center for Cyber Intelligence developed malware, viruses and weaponized “zero-day” exploits, or flaws in technology like smartphones and internet-connected TVs that are not yet known to the manufacturer.

Legally, the CIA can use these cyber weapons only against foreign targets, not against U.S. citizens. But WikiLeaks said at the time that it was given the documents by a former U.S. government hacker or contractor concerned about “whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers.”

Assange’s release of the Vault 7 tools jeopardized a potential immunity deal that law enforcement officials had been weighing for him in early 2017 in exchange for his testimony about WikiLeaks’ ties to Russian intelligence officers, according to The New York Times.

“There is no question that there are leak cases that can’t be prosecuted against the leaker or the leakee because the information is so sensitive that, for your proof at trial, you would have to confirm it is authentic,” said Mary McCord, who was acting assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department until 2017. “So the irony, often, is that the higher the classification of the leaked material, the harder it is to prosecute.”

So instead, the Justice Department will go after Assange on the one count for allegedly assisting Manning and the 17-count Espionage Act indictment. There are no plans to bring any additional indictments prior to his extradition.

While the Manning leak indictment was an expected move, the Espionage Act charges startled the legal community as a potential precedent-setting action. Traditionally, the law has been used to punish government officials who reveal classified information, not the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information. Press freedom activists immediately warned that the case could criminalize everyday journalistic behavior, such as soliciting sensitive information from government sources.

Federal officials insist they have a strong case, arguing that Assange is not a journalist and intentionally published the names of confidential sources in war zones over the objections of national security officials.

“There is a comfort level within the national security establishment of where the charges ended up,” the U.S. national security official told POLITICO.

Still, just several months ago, numerous experts felt confident that prosecutors would also hit Assange with charges over Vault 7. Prominent national security journalist Marcy Wheeler predicted in February that DOJ would “very clearly go after Assange” for the Vault 7 disclosure, and that a sealed indictment against him in the Eastern District of Virginia was likely related to that leak — the CIA is, after all, headquartered in Virginia, as ABC noted. Assange himself reportedly expressed concern that prosecutors would charge him with crimes related to Vault 7.

DOJ has charged one person in the Vault 7 theft. A former CIA employee, Joshua Schulte, was indicted for transmitting the Vault 7 documents to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is set for November. In April, prosecutors in his case asked the judge to keep the search warrants confidential because disseminating them could “impede ongoing investigations,” prompting more speculation over potential charges against Assange.

“Going after Assange for the Vault 7 leak would seem to involve more serious misconduct and have fewer” press freedom implications, said Carl Tobias, the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond Law School in Virginia. He noted that authorities have mechanisms, like redaction and judge reviews, to protect sensitive information.

But prosecutors have not accused Assange of coaxing Schulte to release the CIA tools, as they allege Assange did with Manning. According to court documents, Assange asked Manning for specific classified documents and advised her on how to hack into a government computer.

Manning is in jail over her refusal to testify before a grand jury in the Assange case. Her lawyers have argued that if the Justice Department does not intend to bring further charges against Assange, the previous need for her testimony should be rendered moot.

“If indeed the government has concluded their investigation, then there is no further need to coerce her compliance with the grand jury, and thus, there can be no legitimate ongoing reason to hold her in contempt,” Moira Meltzer-Cohen, an attorney for Manning, told POLITICO. “If the investigation has ended, then Chelsea must be released.""

WikiLeaks began releasing the Vault 7 documents in April 2017, prompting then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to slam the organization as a “hostile intelligence service.”

The exposed documents describe how the CIA’s secretive Center for Cyber Intelligence developed malware, viruses and weaponized “zero-day” exploits, or flaws in technology like smartphones and internet-connected TVs that are not yet known to the manufacturer.

Legally, the CIA can use these cyber weapons only against foreign targets, not against U.S. citizens. But WikiLeaks said at the time that it was given the documents by a former U.S. government hacker or contractor concerned about “whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers.”

Assange’s release of the Vault 7 tools jeopardized a potential immunity deal that law enforcement officials had been weighing for him in early 2017 in exchange for his testimony about WikiLeaks’ ties to Russian intelligence officers, according to The New York Times.

413,‘Nasty’ debate erupts over Trump’s criticism of Meghan Markle ahead of UK trip,Quint Forgey,"Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, is on maternity leave and will not join other members of the royal family in meeting with President Donald Trump next week | Daniel Leal-Olivas/Getty Images ‘Nasty’ debate erupts over Trump’s criticism of Meghan Markle ahead of UK trip Comment among several by president to have caused controversy in lead-up to state visit.

Days ahead of his first state visit to the United Kingdom, debate is raging in both the U.S. and Britain over U.S. President Donald Trump’s use of the word “nasty"" in relation to America’s most famous royal, Meghan Markle.

The president, who is prone to creating controversies overseas, employed the descriptor during a pre-trip Oval Office interview Friday with the British tabloid the Sun, after a reporter invoked comments Markle made three years ago that were critical of then-candidate Trump’s White House run.

Markle, whose royal title is the duchess of Sussex, is on maternity leave with her three-week-old son, Archie, and will not join other members of the royal family in meeting with the president.

“She can’t make it because she’s got maternity leave. Are you sorry not to see her? Because she wasn’t so nice about you during the campaign. I don’t know if you saw that,” the Sun asked Trump.

“I didn’t know that, no. I didn’t know that. No, I hope she’s OK. I did not know that, no,” Trump replied.

“She said she’d move to Canada if you got elected. It turned out she moved to Britain,” the Sun continued.

“A lot of people moving here, so what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty,” Trump said.

The Sun also asked the president whether it is “good having an American princess,” and if Markle’s May 2018 marriage to Prince Harry of Wales, now the duke of Sussex, strengthened the ties between the U.S. and the UK.

“I think it’s nice. I think it’s nice, and I’m sure she will do excellently,” Trump said. “She will be very good. She will be very good. I hope she does.”

Markle in 2016 accused Trump of being “divisive” and “misogynistic” during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore.”

Amid a torrent of disapproving social media posts and a flurry of weekend news reports promulgating the president’s “nasty” remark about the 37-year-old duchess, the “Official Trump War Room” Twitter account — which claims to be managed by Trump’s reelection campaign — sought to exercise some damage control.

“Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ‘nasty,’” the account tweeted Saturday morning, along with a 44-second audio clip of the president’s interview with the Sun. “Here is what he actually said. Listen for yourself!”

That message was subsequently mocked online as self-defeating and for amplifying the president’s insult, which he has previously deployed to attack female political rivals.

Human Events, a relaunched outlet run by Breitbart alumni, also suggested Trump was referring to Markle's comments as nasty, and not the duchess herself.

As of Saturday afternoon, the president had not addressed the controversy on his social media feed. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has a history of using the word ""nasty"" to describe women: He called 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “such a nasty woman” at an October debate one month before the election. In April, he said that 2020 White House hopeful Senator Kamala Harris had “a little bit of a nasty wit,” and described the California Democrat’s questioning of Attorney General William Barr at a congressional hearing last month as “probably very nasty.”

Trump also applied the sobriquet to San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz after she criticized the president's response to Hurricane Maria.

Trump’s assessment of Markle was just one of several diplomatic faux pas by the president in the past week that have done little to bolster the “special relationship” before he journeys across the Atlantic to arrive in London on Monday.

In the same interview with the Sun, Trump expressed his support for former U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to become Britain’s next prime minister, remarking that the ex-London mayor is “a very good guy, a very talented person” who “would do a very good job” replacing outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party.

Trump also criticized May, who is set to resign on June 7, for her Brexit negotiations with the European Union, remarking that her government allowed the bloc “to have all the cards, and it is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage.”

Trump is scheduled to participate next week in a round of talks with May in 10 Downing Street, as well as attend a state banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. The first time the president came face-to-face with the 93-year-old monarch in July 2018, he was widely rebuked online for walking ahead of her at Windsor Castle as they inspected her honor guard, a breach of royal protocol.

A month later, Trump told attendees at a Pennsylvania rally that the queen kept him waiting for their meeting. However, footage of their encounter broadcast live across Britain showed the queen waiting for the president for 12 minutes and looking at her watch.","Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, is on maternity leave and will not join other members of the royal family in meeting with President Donald Trump next week | Daniel Leal-Olivas/Getty Images ‘Nasty’ debate erupts over Trump’s criticism of Meghan Markle ahead of UK trip Comment among several by president to have caused controversy in lead-up to state visit.

416,German SPD in crisis as leader Nahles quits,Joshua Posaner,"BERLIN — German Social Democrat leader Andrea Nahles said Sunday she would quit after a disastrous showing in recent elections, heralding more turbulence in the ranks of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition partner.

The Social Democratic Party (SPD) — a giant of German post-war politics — secured just 15.8 percent of the vote in last week's European Parliament election, coming in a distant third to Merkel’s conservatives and the Greens. On the same day, the SPD lost Bremen, a stronghold in northwest Germany that it had controlled for nearly 74 years.

Nahles' departure, after just over a year in office, will likely lead to fresh debate within the center-left SPD over whether to continue in government with Merkel's center-right bloc. Some party members argue that serving as the chancellor's junior partner has diluted the SPD's identity and led to a loss of support; others insist that taking part in government allows the party to implement its ideas and that the SPD would fare even worse without the profile that comes with being in office.

Discontent over the election results had prompted Nahles to call a vote on Tuesday to determine whether she should continue as leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag. But she preempted that vote on Sunday by declaring she has concluded she does not have the backing to remain as party chairperson or parliamentary group chief.

""Discussions within the parliamentary group and the large amount of feedback from the party have shown me that there is no longer support for me in holding these offices,"" she wrote in a statement to party members.

A former labor minister and the party's first female leader, Nahles took over as SPD chairperson in April 2018. Her election followed another brief and unsuccessful period of leadership under former European Parliament President Martin Schulz.

The SPD has governed in coalition with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and their Bavarian allies since 2013. The party decided to renew that coalition despite suffering heavy losses in a 2017 general election. Nahles was a key figure in persuading SPD members to support that decision, thanks to a powerful speech at a party congress in January last year.

Among the possible contenders to succeed Nahles are Schulz, Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Manuela Schwesig, the premier of the northeastern regional state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

In an interview with the Tagesspiegel newspaper published Sunday, Scholz noted that the SPD has insisted on taking stock of the government's work halfway through its term, in the fall of this year.

Asked if he would recommend pulling out of government if key SPD policies are not implemented, Scholz said: ""I can only advise everyone to take this half-time stocktaking very seriously.

In an interview with the Tagesspiegel newspaper published Sunday, Scholz noted that the SPD has insisted on taking stock of the government's work halfway through its term, in the fall of this year.

Asked if he would recommend pulling out of government if key SPD policies are not implemented, Scholz said: ""I can only advise everyone to take this half-time stocktaking very seriously. That's what I'm doing.""","BERLIN — German Social Democrat leader Andrea Nahles said Sunday she would quit after a disastrous showing in recent elections, heralding more turbulence in the ranks of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition partner.
On the same day, the SPD lost Bremen, a stronghold in northwest Germany that it had controlled for nearly 74 years.
Discontent over the election results had prompted Nahles to call a vote on Tuesday to determine whether she should continue as leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag.
A former labor minister and the party's first female leader, Nahles took over as SPD chairperson in April 2018.

Photo: Ina Fassbender | AFP/Getty Images. Jean-Claude Juncker: I get Euroskeptical sometimes Nearing end of term, European Commission chief ruminates on living in a hotel and not having his own plane.

Even the president of the European Commission has his Euroskeptical moments.

""We have to differentiate between Euroskeptics and anti-Europeans. There’s certainly nothing wrong with a healthy skepticism about the EU’s everyday activities. I become a Euroskeptic at least once a day,"" Jean-Claude Juncker told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.

Not that Juncker is planning to join the ranks of Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini or French far-right leader Marine Le Pen. But he expressed annoyance at some EU rules.

As an example, he cited the costs that could result from some of his commissioners winning seats in the European Parliament election. If those commissioners take up their seats, their home governments would be entitled to nominate replacements to serve only until the end of the current Commission on October 31.

""This would cost the European taxpayer a million euros per commissioner, for relocation, staff and the lifelong pension which every commissioner gets ... If heads of state or government insist on replacing them, no citizen will understand this!"" he declared, saying other commissioners could take on the work of their departing colleagues for the final few months.

However, Juncker seemed to think the European taxpayer could be more accommodating in other areas. He noted the European Commission president does not have an official residence and said he has spent the last five years living in a 50 square-meter hotel apartment.

""I couldn’t invite anyone home. I can’t talk to official visitors sitting on my bed!"" Juncker said.

Juncker also noted he had to fly on commercial flights as the Commission does not have its own plane for official business.

""When I was talking to Donald Trump, I was constantly looking at my watch so that I wouldn’t miss my flight home. Trump kept saying, ‘Your plane can wait!’ He didn’t realize that I didn’t have my own aeroplane,"" Juncker added.

As for his successor, Juncker stopped short of a full-throated endorsement of Manfred Weber, despite the two men belonging to the same political alliance, the center-right European People's Party (EPP).

Juncker said the German member of the European Parliament is ""a good listener and has sufficient knowledge"" to be the next Commission president. But he said two of Weber's competitors, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans, could also do the job.

""There are several candidates. There's no sense in me speaking out in favor of one of them,"" he said.","European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker attends the Charlemagne prize award ceremony on May 30, 2019 at the town hall of Aachen, western Germany.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy confirmed Saturday that a “request was made” to “minimize the visibility” of the USS John S. McCain during President Donald Trump’s state visit to Japan.

""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, chief of Navy information, said in a statement.

""There were also no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain,” the statement said.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Wednesday that the White House wanted to move the destroyer — named partly for the late Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) — “out of sight” ahead of Trump’s trip to Tokyo earlier this month.

Trump tweeted Wednesday that he “was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan,” and told reporters at the White House on Thursday that whoever was responsible for the request was “well-meaning.”

“The Navy is fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by the Secretary of Defense,” Brown said in his statement Saturday. “Our forward-deployed Naval forces continue to stand ready to execute their assigned missions.”","The USS John S.

421,Italy to evict Steve Bannon’s academy from monastery,Rym Momtaz,"Former adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump Steve Bannon | Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images Italy to evict Steve Bannon’s academy from monastery Trump’s former chief strategist planned to use alt-right academy to build European nationalist movement.

Steve Bannon's training academy for nationalists is set to lose its spiritual home.

Italy's Culture Ministry announced it will revoke the lease on a state-owned monastery given to Dignitatis Humanae Institute (DHI), a right-wing Roman Catholic institute affiliated with Bannon, the former Breitbart executive and ex-chief strategist to Donald Trump.

""DHI has failed to comply with the obligation to pay the concession fee, the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance obligations,"" Gianluca Vacca, undersecretary for cultural heritage said in a statement Friday.

Bannon saw the alt-right academy at the Trisulti Charterhouse in Collepardo, around 70 kilometers southeast of Rome, as part of his vision to build a movement bringing together populists from across Europe. His project drew criticism from the left and was also denounced by a top Catholic cardinal in May.

According to a letter obtained by POLITICO, Cardinal Renato Maria Martino, the honorary president of DHI, raised objections to using the monastery for political purposes. He wrote to Benjamin Harnwell, Bannon's close associate in Italy who is spearheading the project, on January 29, 2019 demanding that there be no ""distortions or modifications"" to an original plan to create an apolitical Catholic study and training center.

Harnwell vowed to fight the culture ministry's order.

“The DHI will contest this illegitimate maneuver with every resource at its disposal no matter how many years it takes. And we will win,” he said on Friday.

Vacca, a member of the 5Star Movement that governs together with the far-right League party, said the decision was not politically motivated.

""Political opinions have nothing to do with us, we are interested in respecting the law and protecting the national cultural heritage,"" he said in the statement.","Former adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump Steve Bannon | Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images Italy to evict Steve Bannon’s academy from monastery Trump’s former chief strategist planned to use alt-right academy to build European nationalist movement.

422,EU Confidential Goes Green,Ryan Heath,"EU Confidential Goes Green POLITICO’s flagship podcast, EU Confidential, is devoting special episodes to green themes between March and September 2019. In this occasional series, the show zooms in on the big issues around climate and sustainability with its signature mix of compelling interviews, expert journalism and lively debate.

This episode is all about cities and features interviews with Amanda Eichel, executive director of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and Anna König Jerlmyr, the mayor of Stockholm & president of EUROCITIES. The Swedish capital is growing fast but shrinking its emissions — by 58 percent since 1990 — at the same time.

The podcast panel dives into the Yellow Jackets, talk of a Green Wave in European politics, and asks why Manfred Weber, the center-right candidate to be the next European Commission president, is missing from the climate debate.

Are we headed for climate disaster, and is the EU the solution?

Six Members of the European Parliament from across the political spectrum and around the Continent debated the question, and others, at the recent POLITICO European Elections Great Debate. Ryan Heath hosted the debate, which took place on April 2 in Brussels, between Mark Demesmaeker, Fredrick Federley, Jo Leinen, Maris.

For EU Green Week and EU Public Health Week, we go to an issue at the intersection of those themes: air quality.

In the latest edition of our occasional EU Confidential Goes Green series, our feature interview is with Zoltán Massay-Kosubek of the European Public Health Alliance. And the regular podcast panel of Alva Finn and Lina Aburous are joined by POLITICO's Kalina Oroschakoff to debate what works and what doesn't when it comes to improving our air.

The World Health Organisation attributes up to 7 million deaths annually to air pollution.

The topic is getting political too, thanks to scandals like Dieselgate. And people are turning to a growing number of devices and apps that tell them exactly how exposed they are to the dangers. The EU is at the heart of these discussions: a would-be enforcer that with a patchy record and oversight over contradictory monitoring systems.

Here’s another thing to consider: Unlike other deadly things you can breathe, like cigarette smoke, it’s a lot harder for individuals to control their exposure to air pollution. We explore these ideas and more in this week's podcast.

423,Warnings over opioid use spook EU countries into action,Carmen Paun,"Spooked by North America’s deadly opioid epidemic, Europe is waking up to the signs that abuse of pain medication is rising.

The EU’s drugs monitoring agency on Thursday warned that synthetic opioids are a “growing concern” in Europe.

One in five people entering drug treatment facilities for an opioid-related problem “now reports a synthetic opioid, rather than heroin, as their main problem drug; and these drugs are becoming more commonly detected in drug overdose cases,” says the report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).

Although Europe is not yet experiencing the crisis that has caused thousands of deaths in the U.S. and Canada, it’s a sign that the Continent cannot remain complacent about opioid abuse.

Belgium, Finland and the U.K. have in recent months issued new guidelines for doctors on prescribing opioids-based medicines in an effort to stop a similar development taking hold in their countries.

""We can give opioids in acute ways, but we have to avoid the long-term use or the overuse” — Jan van Zundert, anesthesiologist at the Hospital Oost-Limburg

Opioids are a class of drugs that produce feelings of pleasure and pain relief. They include illegal substances, such as heroin, but also codeine, oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, methadone, morphine and tramadol, which are found in medicines prescribed by doctors to manage severe pain. They were initially used for cancer patients battling pain toward the end of their lives, but their prescription has since been extended to manage other types of pain.

Synthetic opioids that are usually prescribed as medicines appear to be playing an increasing role in the drug problem in many parts of Europe, the EMCDDA report says. The report points to fentanyl as a problem drug in Estonia, buprenorphine in Finland and the Czech Republic and methadone in Germany and Denmark.

It says that 11 new synthetic opioids were detected in 2018, including six new fentanyl derivatives. Since 2009, there have been 34 fentanyl derivatives detected in Europe, the EU agency says.

In Belgium, health insurance organizations’ reimbursement of opioids-based pain medication has increased by almost a third between 2010 and 2017, according to a recent report by Belgian health care payer INAMI, cited by broadcaster RTBF.

“We're learning from what's happening in the U.S.” — Bart Morlion, director of the Leuven Center for Algology and Pain Management at the University Hospital Leuven

General practitioners prescribe such medication most often, the report said. It advised doctors not to prescribe them too quickly and to regularly re-evaluate their use when they do.

That’s what Jan van Zundert, an anesthesiologist who heads the pain centre of the Hospital Oost-Limburg in the Belgian town of Genk, has been doing. “I prescribe it for cancer patients, but I try to avoid it for non-cancer pain. We can give opioids in acute ways, but we have to avoid the long-term use or the overuse,” he said.

While for cancer pain, prescription opioids are still considered the gold standard, they are not a magic bullet for managing chronic pain in general, he said.

In Europe, the weaker opioid tramadol is used more frequently, while in the U.S. powerful opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone are fueling the current epidemic, according to van Zundert.

In Finland, which has seen a rise in oxycodone prescription, the social insurance authority will send out letters to some 7,000 doctors and dentists this summer urging them to be cautious when prescribing strong opioids due to the risk of addiction, Yle reported.

In Britain, powerful painkillers will have to carry addiction warnings, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced in late May. He said he is concerned “by the recent increase in people addicted to opioid drugs.” A 2018 BBC investigation showed that GPs in England prescribed 23.8 million opioids-based painkillers in 2017, 10 million more than a decade earlier.

The U.K. is not among the countries with the highest availability of prescription opioids, however. In the EU, those were Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain, the OECD said in a report last month, which was based on 2014-2016 data.

“At the moment, we have less of a problem than the U.S. We’re at an earlier stage and we have to be very watchful,” said Bart Morlion, the director of the Leuven Center for Algology and Pain Management at the University Hospital Leuven in Belgium.

Morlion — who also serves as president of the European Pain Federation, which represents health care workers in the field of pain medicine — said that there was now a greater awareness of the risk of addiction than a few years ago.

“We're learning from what's happening in the U.S.,” he said.

426,Theresa May’s Brexit Schadenfreude,Tom Mctague,"LONDON — Inside No. 10 Downing Street, the weight has all but lifted.

Where there was anxiety and stress, there is now the first glimmer of Schadenfreude.

Though Theresa May will stay on as caretaker prime minister beyond her official resignation date on Friday, the great Brexit conundrum that defeated her is now everyone else’s problem — in Britain and in the rest of Europe. And it will prove just as impossible to solve, many of those close to her have concluded.

In the U.K., May's successor will face the same inescapable political realities of a hung parliament and an immovable EU27. But the EU is now just as stuck as the U.K., three senior U.K. officials claimed. The prospect of forcing Britain out of the bloc on October 31 has begun to split the EU27; risks causing recessions in a string of countries; and jeopardizes the peace settlement in Ireland. It also opens the door to Britain as an offshore economic competitor rather than an integrated ally.

Forcing the U.K. out of the EU without a deal would tear up almost three years of work on the Withdrawal Agreement and impose an immediate border in Ireland, which the backstop is designed to avoid.

And yet, to allow the situation to drag on as the U.K. radicalizes within the EU carries its own strategic risks to the bloc, officials in the U.K. and some European capitals now argue. The prospect of months — or even years — of further Brexit drama, stalled European reform, and the toxic perception of democracy denied, pose their own systemic threat.

The result is that in her failure, May has managed to do exactly what Brussels sought to avoid: exporting Britain's domestic crisis to the rest of Europe. In doing so, the prospect of an imposed no-deal crashout on October 31 has increased, as the pressure builds on EU leaders to put an end to the saga, regardless of the costs.

One EU27 official said the mood in Dublin is particularly pessimistic. “I’m beginning to find it hard to see how no deal can be avoided,” the official said. “[French President Emmanuel] Macron is getting into full ‘I told you so’ mode. This is what he predicted would happen. [Yet], in Brussels, Brexit has largely disappeared [from the agenda].”

When the Article 50 deadline was extended for the second time in April, most leaders, as well Council and Commission Presidents Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker favored a longer delay than the October 31 deadline the EU27 eventually settled on. And most EU27 diplomats still think the U.K. would be granted a further extension if it asked for one.

Nonetheless, warning shots have already been fired in Berlin and Paris against pushing back the Halloween deadline. The message: The cost of no solution may, by then, outweigh the cost of no deal.

Growing alarm

An Elysée official explained France's growing alarm at the situation in London — and said that more and more countries are coming around to Macron's hard-line stance.

""The diagnosis we did in March/April, at the last [European Council summit] seems, unfortunately, to have been confirmed,"" the official said. ""We locked ourselves into a process that isn’t clear, that didn’t allow the U.K. to find ... a solution and everyone is starting to say we shouldn’t continue in this stalemate."" He added: ""A lot of countries are saying, it would be abhorrent to have another extension beyond October 31.""

The official said the Benelux countries and Spain are coming around to the French point of view. ""There is a realization that we cannot continue with this confusion,"" the official said (although two EU27 officials in Brussels said there has been no change of position from those countries in regular Brexit-related meetings).

From France's perspective, no deal is not the worst-case scenario. ""The worst is the slow destruction of our energy to reform the European project,"" the same senior official who has direct knowledge of Macron's position explained. ""Our responsibility is to avoid importing the British crisis and to find the time and political capital to implement our project without being obsessed by Brexit. It is the British that contaminated the European agenda, not the other way around.""

The official said it would be ""quite paradoxical and not very smart or fair"" to renegotiate with May's successor after telling her the EU27 would not budge on the Withdrawal Agreement. ""Only Ireland can say the backstop is no longer necessary, but that’s not the case. We won’t have the backstop debate again,"" the official said.

Some of May's closest advisers believe the French president — and to a lesser extent German Chancellor Angela Merkel — have finally understood the danger to the EU posed by a stalled British exit, but too late to come up with a solution that doesn't cause huge diplomatic and economic harm across Europe.

“Macron has showed he understands the danger, but has understood too late,” said a senior U.K. official close to May. “He knows what’s coming but doesn’t know how to solve it. He’s ahead of the rest. But they [France and Germany] weren’t paying enough attention. Now it’s too late.”

Forcing the U.K. out of the EU without a deal would tear up almost three years of work on the Withdrawal Agreement and impose an immediate border in Ireland, which the backstop is designed to avoid.

Despite this, contingency plans for the Irish border under a no-deal exit have all but stopped. “A degree of progress was made in the run-up to 10 April,” said a second EU27 official. “[But] there’s no evidence at the moment that they are giving any significant part of their intelligence to this. We thought we might have to address these questions, but these were the dogs that didn’t bark. There is nothing you could describe as progress.”

Following a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn in Dublin last month, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told the Irish parliament's working group of committee chairs he had warned the British Labour leader that he thinks the chances of another extension in October are ""pretty slim.""

""There is a hardening view across the European Union that we cannot continue to have rolling extensions,” he said, according to the Irish Independent. “While there could potentially be a further extension if there was an election, I don’t think it is viable to believe that there would be sufficient support around the European Council for a further extension while the U.K. continues to figure it out.""

Halloween crashout

Despite Macron's analysis, EU27 diplomats say they still expect the October deadline to be extended again — avoiding a Halloween crashout at the end of the month.

However, the expectation — according to two diplomats in Brussels — is that this extension will be the last one. At this point, EU countries will lose confidence that the deal can ever get through and will trigger their no-deal plans.

There is also skepticism about Macron’s ability to assemble a majority against extension on October 31, especially since he has found himself almost isolated among leaders on other issues.

The lack of support for forcing Britain out on October 31 could quickly change though, some officials say. There are diplomatic concerns that if May’s replacement comes from the hard Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party — for whom the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is the standard-bearer — the new premier could become a “British Trump.” The U.K.’s rights as an EU member could be used to cause trouble for the bloc in order to force concessions on Brexit.

Macron is also said to be concerned about the radicalizing effect in Britain caused by the failure to deliver Brexit. His analysis draws parallels with the surge in support for Marine Le Pen’s National Front following the French rejection of the EU constitution, which was then introduced anyway in the form of the Lisbon Treaty.

Some close to May believe Paris and Berlin were not paying sufficient attention earlier in the process when they were both dealing with their own national elections and that they should have foreseen how Britain's crisis could rebound on them.

In private they are also dismissive of the EU's strategy of ruling out renegotiation to persuade British MPs to back the deal. “They are trying to solve the issue by creating pressures to force a change in domestic British politics,” the official close to May said. ""You could not contrive of more incentive for MPs to vote for the deal than on March 29 and it did not work. They are still trying it because they cannot admit that the issue is structural, not just about the U.K. They’ve gone too far to row back now, but they’ve realized the problem.”

In Brussels, this is seen as a misreading. The EU position is set because a deal has been reached and not because it is a tactic to try to affect U.K. domestic politics. The blame for the crisis lies in London not Brussels, EU officials say. It is not the EU's fault that May was not able to rally her parliamentary troops behind the deal she herself negotiated.

Yet the risk now, as May’s departing aides see it, is in the EU's entrenched stance, whereby any concession over the core issue of the backstop is impossible. Inside team May, there is weary amusement at the Conservative leadership candidates' proffered solutions to the Brexit impasse: from Health Secretary Matt Hancock's proposal for a time-limit on the backstop to Johnson's blind insistence that Britain ""will"" leave on October 31 regardless of the political considerations in the U.K. parliament.

Some senior officials in London and Dublin now fear the process is leading inexorably to a no-deal exit, in which everyone loses and the very thing the backstop is designed to avoid — a hard border — is introduced immediately.

“It’s like smashing your head against a brick wall, it’s just all so obvious,"" said one of May's most senior U.K. officials.

427,Theresa May’s Brexit Schadenfreude,Rym Momtaz,"LONDON — Inside No. 10 Downing Street, the weight has all but lifted.

Where there was anxiety and stress, there is now the first glimmer of Schadenfreude.

Though Theresa May will stay on as caretaker prime minister beyond her official resignation date on Friday, the great Brexit conundrum that defeated her is now everyone else’s problem — in Britain and in the rest of Europe. And it will prove just as impossible to solve, many of those close to her have concluded.

In the U.K., May's successor will face the same inescapable political realities of a hung parliament and an immovable EU27. But the EU is now just as stuck as the U.K., three senior U.K. officials claimed. The prospect of forcing Britain out of the bloc on October 31 has begun to split the EU27; risks causing recessions in a string of countries; and jeopardizes the peace settlement in Ireland. It also opens the door to Britain as an offshore economic competitor rather than an integrated ally.

Forcing the U.K. out of the EU without a deal would tear up almost three years of work on the Withdrawal Agreement and impose an immediate border in Ireland, which the backstop is designed to avoid.

And yet, to allow the situation to drag on as the U.K. radicalizes within the EU carries its own strategic risks to the bloc, officials in the U.K. and some European capitals now argue. The prospect of months — or even years — of further Brexit drama, stalled European reform, and the toxic perception of democracy denied, pose their own systemic threat.

429,Knot your typical hawk in the ECB race,Bjarke Smith-Meyer,"Klaas Knot has a branding problem if he aims to succeed Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank.

“He’s a super hawk,” one European Parliament member said in a preview of the reaction that the Dutch national bank chief could expect to any bid for the Frankfurt job. “I don’t think he has a chance.”

But Knot is eager to cast off the stereotype of a bird of prey, attacking Draghi's dovish interest rate cuts and other measures to pump money into the economy, aiming to stimulate growth.

“I don’t think that my voting record [in the ECB’s governing council] supports such a claim,” Knot told POLITICO in his Amsterdam office at the Dutch central bank.

A hawkish reputation is a problem in vying for the ECB’s top job when Europe is divided between a supposedly austere north and freer-spending south. The stakes of the clash are magnified by an uncertain economic recovery and a populist wave born from a decade of financial crises.

“We’ve had a very dovish [ECB president] and it’s time to have a hawk"" — Senior Dutch government official

European leaders last Tuesday formally opened the process of haggling over the bloc's top jobs, including the powerful post now held by Draghi, an Italian.

Knot declined to put his own name forward as a candidate, as is protocol for aspirants to technocratic positions.

“I never respond to these types of questions,” Knot said of ECB aspirations, in the interview last week.

“I’ve been renewed at the Netherlands Bank almost a year ago,"" he said, in addition to his work at the Financial Stability Board, an international group of policymakers meeting in Basel, Switzerland. “I’ve just been appointed vice chair of the FSB and the incoming chair in two and half years from now.""

“I focus on these kinds of responsibilities and only if I get approached for a new responsibility, then I will formulate an answer,” he said.

Talons out

The Netherlands is pushing for the EU to make that approach soon. And The Hague has its own talons out.

“We’ve had a very dovish [ECB president] and it’s time to have a hawk,” a senior Dutch government official said, requesting anonymity due to the political sensitivity surrounding the lobbying campaign. “It’s time for a difference.”

European Council President Donald Tusk prepared the battleground for the ECB with an informal chat over dinner at last Tuesday’s summit meeting. The discussions focused on the process rather than names.

Besides Draghi, whose eight-year term ends on October 31, the leaders are due this year to pick replacements for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as well as Tusk himself. Tusk is expected to name ECB candidates as soon as June.

The challenge for EU leaders is to find someone who is moderate enough to satisfy the hawks, including Germany, and the doves, such as France.

Both those countries have their candidates. Berlin is putting forward Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann. France has its central bank governor, François Villeroy de Galhau, as well as Benoît Cœuré, who already has a seat on the ECB's executive board.

The 52-year-old Knot and Finland’s central bank governor, Olli Rehn, have emerged as compromise candidates, as a result.

Too 'simplistic'

Politically speaking, the Netherlands is in the hawkish camp of Germany. Some Brussels official say Knot is even more hard-line than his Bundesbank counterpart. But the Dutchman says that’s not so.

Knot “wholeheartedly” supported the ECB’s decision, he said, to buy short-term government bonds from struggling countries during the sovereign-debt crisis of 2012. Weidmann opposed those ""Outright Monetary Transactions,"" while OMT backers said the move helped save the euro.

Knot said he also “had nothing against negative interest rates” and has been “a big fan” of long-term loans to banks to keep credit flowing.

But he, together with Weidmann, did oppose Draghi’s massive €2.6 trillion bond buying scheme known as quantitative easing (QE), which ended in December.

“I was a QE skeptic. That’s been quite well documented,” he said. “But that was one instrument at a specific point in the economic cycle and I don’t think it should put me in such a simplistic sort of hawks-versus-doves comparison.”

“Sometimes he was more outspoken [against QE] than Weidmann,” said ING-DiBa’s chief economist, Carsten Brzeski. “So, do the southern heads of state agree with a QE-opposing governor as ECB presidency?”

Dutch officials who have worked closely with Knot describe him as “moderate” and a “bridge-builder” who can forge compromises.

Euro fight

Making that case will prove difficult, according to Eurasia Group's managing director of Europe, Mujtaba Rahman. The Hague is getting a reputation of its own, as it spars with countries including France over the creation of a eurozone budget, part of an initiative to boost economic safeguards for the single currency bloc.

“The Dutch government have been so tough in relation to the euro area and I do think … in some capitals that’s raised questions about Knot as well,” Rahman said. “He’s not escaped that.”

Knot’s vision for the next ECB presidency seems less aggressive than the Dutch pitch for a rebalancing after Draghi.

“[We'll] see if Germany will push Weidmann’s candidacy against resistance. I think it’d be difficult to go down the Dutch path"" — Holger Schmieding, Berenberg Bank’s chief economist

Europe should be ready to “normalize monetary policy,” Knot said, referring to an unwinding of easy-money measures that include asset purchases and exceptionally low interest rates.

“But only to the extent that economic data will allow us to do so,” he added. He's also mindful that financial markets have become “increasingly dependent” on the ECB’s easy-money initiatives that have been “heavily dominated by [the] aftermath of the crisis.”

Draghi’s successor will have to be “cautious” and “patient” in pulling back the extraordinary measures, Knot said. “It’ll be a slow process and that will require some subtle steering of expectations.”

Waiting their turn

Even if Knot convinces leaders of his moderation, he faces another obstacle from back home: Wim Duisenberg.

The ECB has had only three presidents so far. The late Duisenberg, a Dutchman, was the first and some countries argue the Netherlands should let others have the post before receiving it again. That logic works against the French aspirants, too, as Jean-Claude Trichet followed Duisenberg from 2003 to 2011.

Germany and Finland are meanwhile waiting their turn, to the potential benefit of Weidmann or Rehn, both pleasing to the hawks.

“[We'll] see if Germany will push Weidmann’s candidacy against resistance,” said Holger Schmieding, Berenberg Bank’s chief economist, who predicted Rehn will be the compromise pick. “I think it’d be difficult to go down the Dutch path.”

430,EU commissioner: Jeremy Hunt is a pure nationalist with no clue about history,Eddy Wax,"EU Commissioner of Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis | John Thys/AFP via Getty Images EU commissioner: Jeremy Hunt is a pure nationalist with no clue about history Vytenis Andriukaitis challenges Tory leadership hopeful to debate him on EU and Soviet history.

Vytenis Andriukaitis is angry — at British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

The European health commissioner challenged the Tory leadership hopeful to a debate about a statement Hunt made last year comparing the European Union and the Soviet Union.

""I am ready to debate with all guys around me: Salvini, Hunt, Trump,"" he told POLITICO Friday. Hunt, he added, is a ""pure conservative, nationalist and without post-colonial thinking.""

At the Conservative Party conference in October last year, Hunt infuriated many in Brussels by likening the EU's tactics in the Brexit negotiations to those used by the USSR.

""When Jeremy Hunt tells that story ... of course, he is young, he has no clue, no understanding about what? About history,"" said Andriukaitis.

Andriukaitis, a former Lithuanian health minister, was born in a Soviet gulag after his parents were deported to Siberia on Joseph Stalin's orders. He was twice arrested for involvement in the anti-Soviet underground movement and was instrumental in establishing an independent Lithuania in 1990.

""I tell to Jeremy Hunt ... if you know something about Soviet totalitarianism please ask me, I can explain to you all the issues and it is ... because of my life,"" he said. ""I never saw trees, I never saw forest because it was tundra. I had no understanding of day and night because I was born there [in a gulag] and then stayed there.""

434,Ford confirms plan to close UK Bridgend plant in 2020,Hanne Cokelaere,"Cars for sale at a Ford dealership on May 20, 2019 in the Queens borough of New York City. As the iconic American car company continues to adapt to significant changes in the auto industry, Ford Motor Co. announced that it plans to eliminate about 7,000 salaried jobs -- about 10% of its global white-collar workforce | Spencer Platt via Getty Images Ford confirms plan to close UK Bridgend plant in 2020 Company says closure is part of its Europe business strategy.

U.S. carmaker Ford Motor confirmed Thursday it plans to close its Bridgend engine plant in South Wales in September 2020.

The company said the decision to begin talks with unions on the closure is part of its business strategy for Europe.

“Changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead,” Ford of Europe President Stuart Rowley said in a statement.

Ford did not make reference to Brexit in its announcement, but company executives had previously warned Ford may have to leave the U.K. if Brexit hurts its competitiveness.

The move follows an announcement by British automotive association SMMT that U.K. car production nearly halved in April, as carmakers’ planning for what would have been a no-deal Brexit on March 29 took effect. The association’s Chief Executive Mike Hawes said Brexit uncertainty has done “untold damage” to the industry.

Ford’s Bridgend plant employs 1,700 people. It has been Bridgend's biggest private sector employer for almost 40 years, according to the county council. Councillor Richard Young called the decision to close “the single biggest blow to our economy since the closure of the pits.”

The company said it would remain a “major employer” in the U.K., even after the closure of the Bridgend plant.","Cars for sale at a Ford dealership on May 20, 2019 in the Queens borough of New York City.

435,Labour holds Brexit Party at bay in crucial by-election,Annabelle Dickson,"A strong effort by Labour activists to get out their vote saw Lisa Forbes elected the new MP in the pro-Brexit constituency of Peterborough | Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images Labour holds Brexit Party at bay in crucial by-election Nigel Farage left disappointed after his party comes in second in Peterborough.

PETERBOROUGH, England — The Labour Party secured victory in a key by-election Friday, depriving Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party of what would have been its first House of Commons seat.

Labour candidate Lisa Forbes came in 683 votes ahead of the Brexit Party's Mike Greene in the pro-Brexit constituency of Peterborough.

Conservative Party candidate Paul Bristow came in third in the early hours of Friday morning — the day Prime Minister Theresa May will formally resign as Tory leader.

Farage arrived at the count amid predictions his party could win its first Westminster seat in Peterborough, which has swung between the Labour and Conservative parties for generations, just weeks after the Brexit Party came first in the U.K.'s European parliamentary election. But a strong effort by Labour activists to get out their vote saw Forbes elected the new MP instead, and Farage was nowhere to be found.

In her acceptance speech, Forbes said a rejection of the Brexit Party by the city's voters shows the ""politics of division"" would not win.

Farage spoke with the BBC's ""Today"" program after the result Friday, and said despite his party's loss, ""What you’ve seen from this result last night is that British politics has fundamentally changed, it’s no longer just two parties contesting.""

Asked whether he'd consider doing a deal with the Conservative Party in the aftermath of the by-election, Farage said: ""Well they may have to come and do a deal with us.""

Polling expert John Curtice noted that having secured just 31 percent of the ballots, Forbes had set a record for the lowest share of the vote captured by a winning candidate in a by-election, which he said was confirmation the U.K. is in a “different political world” where no one party can necessarily dominate any particular election. He added that the Brexit Party is still a “significantly disruptive force.”

The smaller Liberal Democrat and Green parties came in fourth and fifth, with 12 percent and 3 percent of the vote respectively. Curtice said their results demonstrate that in the ""squeeze of first past-the-post election,"" those who did not look likely to win were at risk of seeing their vote falling away.

The Peterborough by-election was triggered after the previous Labour MP, Fiona Onasanya, who won the seat from the Tories in 2017, was sacked after she was convicted for perverting the course of justice over a speeding offense.

In her acceptance speech, Forbes said a rejection of the Brexit Party by the city's voters shows the ""politics of division"" would not win.

Forbes joins a parliamentary Labour Party riven with divisions over its Brexit policy. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure from senior figures in his shadow Cabinet, including his deputy Tom Watson and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, to give his unambiguous support to a second EU referendum.

Forbes told the BBC on Friday she had campaigned to honor the result of the referendum and thought Labour is a way off from backing a fresh vote on the U.K.'s membership of the European Union.","A strong effort by Labour activists to get out their vote saw Lisa Forbes elected the new MP in the pro-Brexit constituency of Peterborough | Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images Labour holds Brexit Party at bay in crucial by-election Nigel Farage left disappointed after his party comes in second in Peterborough.

PETERBOROUGH, England — The Labour Party secured victory in a key by-election Friday, depriving Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party of what would have been its first House of Commons seat.

Labour candidate Lisa Forbes came in 683 votes ahead of the Brexit Party's Mike Greene in the pro-Brexit constituency of Peterborough.

Conservative Party candidate Paul Bristow came in third in the early hours of Friday morning — the day Prime Minister Theresa May will formally resign as Tory leader.

Farage arrived at the count amid predictions his party could win its first Westminster seat in Peterborough, which has swung between the Labour and Conservative parties for generations, just weeks after the Brexit Party came first in the U.K.'s European parliamentary election. But a strong effort by Labour activists to get out their vote saw Forbes elected the new MP instead, and Farage was nowhere to be found.

In her acceptance speech, Forbes said a rejection of the Brexit Party by the city's voters shows the ""politics of division"" would not win.

Farage spoke with the BBC's ""Today"" program after the result Friday, and said despite his party's loss, ""What you’ve seen from this result last night is that British politics has fundamentally changed, it’s no longer just two parties contesting.""

Asked whether he'd consider doing a deal with the Conservative Party in the aftermath of the by-election, Farage said: ""Well they may have to come and do a deal with us.""

Polling expert John Curtice noted that having secured just 31 percent of the ballots, Forbes had set a record for the lowest share of the vote captured by a winning candidate in a by-election, which he said was confirmation the U.K. is in a “different political world” where no one party can necessarily dominate any particular election. He added that the Brexit Party is still a “significantly disruptive force.”

The smaller Liberal Democrat and Green parties came in fourth and fifth, with 12 percent and 3 percent of the vote respectively. Curtice said their results demonstrate that in the ""squeeze of first past-the-post election,"" those who did not look likely to win were at risk of seeing their vote falling away.

The Peterborough by-election was triggered after the previous Labour MP, Fiona Onasanya, who won the seat from the Tories in 2017, was sacked after she was convicted for perverting the course of justice over a speeding offense.

In her acceptance speech, Forbes said a rejection of the Brexit Party by the city's voters shows the ""politics of division"" would not win.

Forbes joins a parliamentary Labour Party riven with divisions over its Brexit policy. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure from senior figures in his shadow Cabinet, including his deputy Tom Watson and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, to give his unambiguous support to a second EU referendum.

Forbes told the BBC on Friday she had campaigned to honor the result of the referendum and thought Labour is a way off from backing a fresh vote on the U.K.'s membership of the European Union.","A strong effort by Labour activists to get out their vote saw Lisa Forbes elected the new MP in the pro-Brexit constituency of Peterborough | Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images Labour holds Brexit Party at bay in crucial by-election Nigel Farage left disappointed after his party comes in second in Peterborough.

440,"French government, Fiat Chrysler blame each other for failed Renault bid",Marion Solletty,"A proposed tie-up between Fiat Chrysler and Renault fell apart | Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty Images French government, Fiat Chrysler blame each other for failed Renault bid The merger would have created the world’s third-largest carmaker.

The French government on Thursday dismissed allegations by Fiat Chrysler that political interference was to blame for a failed tie-up with French carmaker Renault.

""The reason why this deal didn't happen was to ensure the alliance with Nissan was preserved. It has nothing to do with the French state stake [in Renault] or political decisions,"" a government official told reporters.

The official denied that the collapse of merger talks had anything to do with conditions posed by the French government on keeping jobs and operations in France. The Fiat Chrysler (FCA) board decided Thursday to pull out of its €33 billion merger proposal with the Renault group, blaming “the political conditions in France.”

Fiat Chrysler’s move came after Renault’s board delayed a decision on whether to engage with the merger proposal at a meeting Wednesday evening. The French government is Renault’s largest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake in the carmaker.

""The [French] State wanted the board to have an additional 5-day delay to secure the support of all stakeholders involved,"" the French finance ministry said in press release.

Renault has a long-standing relationship with Japanese carmaker Nissan, but ties between the two automakers have frayed after Japanese authorities arrested Carlos Ghosn, the former CEO of Renault and chairman of Nissan, last year on charges of financial wrongdoing.

In a statement, the FCA board said that while it “remains firmly convinced of the compelling, transformational rationale” of the 50-50 merger proposal, “it has since become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully.”

Meanwhile, Renault said in a statement that its board is not in a position to green-light the merger talks because of “the request by the French government to postpone the decision to another board meeting.”

A Fiat official said: ""The French government tried to impose conditions that we very simply could not meet.""

The Fiat official said the French sought to delay the merger for the second time after a six-hour late-night board meeting on Wednesday because Paris wanted further reassurances on ""a seat on the board of the new company for the French state, operative headquarters in France and French jobs preservation.""

Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, from the populist 5Stars Movement, told an Italian radio show: “The FCA-Renault case shows it's not always a positive thing when politics intervenes in business.”

The dispute is feeding Italian complaints about France's defense of its industries.

""France is confirmed to be a European country only when it suits them,"" Carlo Calenda, a former economy minister, told la Repubblica, mentioning the standoff between the two countries in 2017 over the decision by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to buy a 50 percent stake in France’s STX shipyard. Initially, the Italians wanted to buy a two-thirds share, but were beaten back by the French government, which only permitted a 50 percent sale.

443,Rory Stewart shakes up Tory leadership race,Charlie Cooper,"LONDON — Rory Stewart is running to be prime minister of the United Kingdom but he's happy to make time for poetry.

Having spent days trying to meet him on his quixotic Conservative leadership campaign tour, it’s only when POLITICO suggests talking Brexit through the lens of poetry that we get his full attention.

The U.K.’s international development secretary, famed for his exotic pre-political life as a diplomat, adventurer and author, is the longest of longshots to replace Prime Minister Theresa May. But the manner of his campaign, his meteoric rise to prominence on social media, and the fact he — a former Remainer who says a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster — probably has no chance, all reveal truths about the volatility of British politics, and the all-consuming nature of Brexit in the race for Tory leadership.

T.S Eliot and Brexit

Stewart’s choice of a poem to reflect this moment in British politics is from T.S. Eliot’s Four Quartets — a 6,800-word collection he says he memorized word-for-word while walking alone in the Himalayas in 2001.

He also learned Eliot’s “The Waste Land” by rote when he was 14 years old (“I can still do most of it,” he says).

“I think [other candidates] are oddly pursuing policies that don’t seem to resonate with the tradition of our party"" — Rory Stewart

His chosen extract begins: “What we call the beginning is often the end / And to make an end is to make a beginning.” It finishes with “So while the light fails / On a winter’s afternoon, in a secluded chapel / History is now and England.”

“It speaks to me about conservatism and new beginnings,” Stewart says over the phone, in between campaign stops, speaking slowly and thoughtfully, in the manner of priest in a confessional.

“It speaks to me about what we owe to tradition and what we owe to the dead and what we take forward for the living. For me, in the end, conservatism is about love of country, deep reverence for the energy of tradition, prudence in foreign policy, restraint at home. That’s my type of conservatism.”

American-born Eliot’s “vision” of England — “or the U.K., as I’d put it,” Stewart says — is “very alive to how much we owe to other countries.”

“It’s very alive to how much we owe to the past,” he continues. “It doesn’t attempt to cut us off from who we were, nor to cut us off from the neighbors that surround us.”

In a campaign where many of the other candidates are vying for the most uncompromising approach to Brexit, Stewart’s pitch is unorthodox. But he says he thinks it captures something about the different choices on offer: what he see as his Brexit pragmatism — he supports the deal May struck last year with the EU — versus disruptive no-deal radicalism.

“I think [other candidates] are oddly pursuing policies that don’t seem to resonate with the tradition of our party,” he says. “I think we’re a party of deals. So, it’s extraordinary that we could become a party of no deal. We are the great pragmatists … a patriotic vision of Britain isn’t a no-deal Brexit.”

'A noted eccentric'

One of 13 candidates to declare (two have since dropped out), Stewart has attracted a disproportionate amount of media attention through his decision to take the campaign to various corners of the U.K., alerting members of the public to his whereabouts via shaky selfie clips on Twitter and inviting them to come and debate him.

On Monday, he drew a crowd at Speakers’ Corner in London’s Hyde Park, the traditional home of free speech and radicals, once frequented by Karl Marx.

Stewart’s prior career did not offer clues to his man-of-the-people campaign style. Born in Hong Kong, the son of a diplomat who also served with the Secret Intelligence Service, he was educated at Eton and Oxford and worked briefly as a private tutor to Princes William and Harry. Stewart is known for his epic walking expeditions, including one crossing Afghanistan in 2002 which became a best-selling travelogue.

He was a diplomat in his 20s, a coalition official in southern Iraq shortly after the 2003 invasion, and then ran a charity, at the behest of Prince Charles, preserving traditional arts in Afghanistan. A Tory MP since 2010 for the rural Penrith and the Border seat, he has held four different junior ministerial posts since 2015 and was elevated to the Cabinet only five weeks ago, at the age of 46.

Despite a life story like a 19th-century gentleman-adventurer, Stewart has been a 21st-century campaigner.

“I’m a sort of Trumpian anti-Trumpian. My whole political style is to get out of Westminster and talk to people on the streets,” he says. He is acutely conscious that celebrity matters in modern politics.

“When people are expressing their views on certain candidates, a lot of those views are just to do with recognition,” he says. “Part of the issue here is that Boris [Johnson, the former foreign secretary and the frontrunner in the race to replace May] is frankly just much more famous.”

“We’ve got to get on to the stage of letting people look at policies,"" he says. “I’m beginning to get to the stage where people cross the street to say hello to me. But that’s only through the last few days through social media.”

MPs will vote on candidates starting next week, eliminating the least popular in a series of ballots, with the last two to undergo a monthlong election campaign followed by a vote by the approximately 124,000 members of the Conservative Party. Under new rules, anyone with eight or more MP backers can stand.

“His video clips are bemusing … he hasn’t a hope of winning and probably knows it, but he does look as if he’s having a good time"" — One Brexiteer MEP

So far, Stewart has only four endorsements, albeit three of them from heavyweights: Justice Secretary David Gauke; the Conservatives' longest-serving MP Ken Clarke; and Winston Churchill’s grandson, Conservative MP Nicholas Soames.

The Stewart campaign team say they are confident of getting past the first hurdle of eight MP supporters, at least.

“He’s very, very clever, very articulate and has an extraordinary amount of courage,” said Gauke. “He’s an extraordinary figure. You just have to read his Wikipedia page … what he had done by the time he was 30. At that point in my life I was completing financial services authority applications for a city law firm.”

Other Tory MPs are less impressed. One, a Brexiteer who is backing Johnson in the race, said Stewart is “a noted eccentric.”

“His video clips are bemusing … he hasn’t a hope of winning and probably knows it, but he does look as if he’s having a good time,” the MP said.

The Brexit factor

The reason Stewart is unlikely to triumph is simple. This is a race defined by Brexit.

He is running as a staunch opponent of a no-deal Brexit, something he thinks is totally at odds with the kind of conservatism he stands for. Tory members who will ultimately decide the race are, according to opinion polls, determined to leave the EU this year with or without a deal.

Many candidates, including Johnson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab are running on pledges to renegotiate May’s deal and, if they can’t, to leave with no deal on October 31. The more cautious approach is represented, among the front-runners, by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, both of whom also warn about the dangers of no deal.

Stewart, currently lagging well behind in terms of MP endorsements, says he simply does not believe an economically disruptive no-deal Brexit is something true, small-c conservatives really want — and he’s determined to prove it.

“I’m sure that in the end voices like mine will prevail"" — Rory Stewart

“I’m fighting for the soul and heart of the Conservative Party,” he says with zeal. “I don’t think the Conservative Party is a party of extremists or populists, and I think I’ll demonstrate that through this election campaign.”

Other MPs speculate that his whole campaign is an attempt to raise his profile in the hope of being given the job of foreign secretary by whoever wins the race. Critics in the party question whether he’s really a Conservative at all or should join a centrist party like the Lib Dems.

Stewart says he thinks he can win, and blithely rejects the suggestion that he’s running for leadership of the wrong party.

“I’m sure that in the end voices like mine will prevail,” he says. “My objective is not to leave the Conservative Party, it’s to represent all the positive energy of the Conservative Party, to represent what I know the association members actually think.

“I don’t believe that 70 percent of them really want no deal. I think that’s unfair to them,” he says. Pollsters ""are asking the wrong questions"" — what looks like support for a no-deal Brexit is really a desire to get Brexit over and done with.

Maybe he won't win, but with Eliot his back-pocket, Stewart will have something to turn to for solace.

""We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time"" — those are the lines that follow the excerpt of the T.S. Eliot poem Stewart has selected.

Is this what the Tories are about to experience, regarding Theresa May's Brexit deal?

""The process of exploration is powerful and necessary,"" Stewart observes, before heading off to the next campaign stop. ""So that when they get back to the place, they can see it for the first time.""

You just have to read his Wikipedia page … what he had done by the time he was 30. At that point in my life I was completing financial services authority applications for a city law firm.”

Other Tory MPs are less impressed. One, a Brexiteer who is backing Johnson in the race, said Stewart is “a noted eccentric.”

“His video clips are bemusing … he hasn’t a hope of winning and probably knows it, but he does look as if he’s having a good time,” the MP said.

The Brexit factor

The reason Stewart is unlikely to triumph is simple. This is a race defined by Brexit.

He is running as a staunch opponent of a no-deal Brexit, something he thinks is totally at odds with the kind of conservatism he stands for. Tory members who will ultimately decide the race are, according to opinion polls, determined to leave the EU this year with or without a deal.

Many candidates, including Johnson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab are running on pledges to renegotiate May’s deal and, if they can’t, to leave with no deal on October 31. The more cautious approach is represented, among the front-runners, by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, both of whom also warn about the dangers of no deal.

Stewart, currently lagging well behind in terms of MP endorsements, says he simply does not believe an economically disruptive no-deal Brexit is something true, small-c conservatives really want — and he’s determined to prove it.

“I’m sure that in the end voices like mine will prevail"" — Rory Stewart

“I’m fighting for the soul and heart of the Conservative Party,” he says with zeal. “I don’t think the Conservative Party is a party of extremists or populists, and I think I’ll demonstrate that through this election campaign.”

Other MPs speculate that his whole campaign is an attempt to raise his profile in the hope of being given the job of foreign secretary by whoever wins the race. Critics in the party question whether he’s really a Conservative at all or should join a centrist party like the Lib Dems.

Stewart says he thinks he can win, and blithely rejects the suggestion that he’s running for leadership of the wrong party.

“I’m sure that in the end voices like mine will prevail,” he says. “My objective is not to leave the Conservative Party, it’s to represent all the positive energy of the Conservative Party, to represent what I know the association members actually think.

“I don’t believe that 70 percent of them really want no deal. I think that’s unfair to them,” he says. Pollsters ""are asking the wrong questions"" — what looks like support for a no-deal Brexit is really a desire to get Brexit over and done with.

Maybe he won't win, but with Eliot his back-pocket, Stewart will have something to turn to for solace.

""We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time"" — those are the lines that follow the excerpt of the T.S. Eliot poem Stewart has selected.

Is this what the Tories are about to experience, regarding Theresa May's Brexit deal?

""The process of exploration is powerful and necessary,"" Stewart observes, before heading off to the next campaign stop. ""So that when they get back to the place, they can see it for the first time.""

445,Rory Stewart shakes up Tory leadership race,Zoya Sheftalovich,"LONDON — Rory Stewart is running to be prime minister of the United Kingdom but he's happy to make time for poetry.

Having spent days trying to meet him on his quixotic Conservative leadership campaign tour, it’s only when POLITICO suggests talking Brexit through the lens of poetry that we get his full attention.

The U.K.’s international development secretary, famed for his exotic pre-political life as a diplomat, adventurer and author, is the longest of longshots to replace Prime Minister Theresa May. But the manner of his campaign, his meteoric rise to prominence on social media, and the fact he — a former Remainer who says a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster — probably has no chance, all reveal truths about the volatility of British politics, and the all-consuming nature of Brexit in the race for Tory leadership.

T.S Eliot and Brexit

Stewart’s choice of a poem to reflect this moment in British politics is from T.S. Eliot’s Four Quartets — a 6,800-word collection he says he memorized word-for-word while walking alone in the Himalayas in 2001.

He also learned Eliot’s “The Waste Land” by rote when he was 14 years old (“I can still do most of it,” he says).

“I think [other candidates] are oddly pursuing policies that don’t seem to resonate with the tradition of our party"" — Rory Stewart

His chosen extract begins: “What we call the beginning is often the end / And to make an end is to make a beginning.” It finishes with “So while the light fails / On a winter’s afternoon, in a secluded chapel / History is now and England.”

“It speaks to me about conservatism and new beginnings,” Stewart says over the phone, in between campaign stops, speaking slowly and thoughtfully, in the manner of priest in a confessional.

“It speaks to me about what we owe to tradition and what we owe to the dead and what we take forward for the living. For me, in the end, conservatism is about love of country, deep reverence for the energy of tradition, prudence in foreign policy, restraint at home. That’s my type of conservatism.”

American-born Eliot’s “vision” of England — “or the U.K., as I’d put it,” Stewart says — is “very alive to how much we owe to other countries.”

“It’s very alive to how much we owe to the past,” he continues. “It doesn’t attempt to cut us off from who we were, nor to cut us off from the neighbors that surround us.”

In a campaign where many of the other candidates are vying for the most uncompromising approach to Brexit, Stewart’s pitch is unorthodox. But he says he thinks it captures something about the different choices on offer: what he see as his Brexit pragmatism — he supports the deal May struck last year with the EU — versus disruptive no-deal radicalism.

“I think [other candidates] are oddly pursuing policies that don’t seem to resonate with the tradition of our party,” he says. “I think we’re a party of deals. So, it’s extraordinary that we could become a party of no deal. We are the great pragmatists … a patriotic vision of Britain isn’t a no-deal Brexit.”

'A noted eccentric'

One of 13 candidates to declare (two have since dropped out), Stewart has attracted a disproportionate amount of media attention through his decision to take the campaign to various corners of the U.K., alerting members of the public to his whereabouts via shaky selfie clips on Twitter and inviting them to come and debate him.

On Monday, he drew a crowd at Speakers’ Corner in London’s Hyde Park, the traditional home of free speech and radicals, once frequented by Karl Marx.

Stewart’s prior career did not offer clues to his man-of-the-people campaign style. Born in Hong Kong, the son of a diplomat who also served with the Secret Intelligence Service, he was educated at Eton and Oxford and worked briefly as a private tutor to Princes William and Harry. Stewart is known for his epic walking expeditions, including one crossing Afghanistan in 2002 which became a best-selling travelogue.

He was a diplomat in his 20s, a coalition official in southern Iraq shortly after the 2003 invasion, and then ran a charity, at the behest of Prince Charles, preserving traditional arts in Afghanistan. A Tory MP since 2010 for the rural Penrith and the Border seat, he has held four different junior ministerial posts since 2015 and was elevated to the Cabinet only five weeks ago, at the age of 46.

Despite a life story like a 19th-century gentleman-adventurer, Stewart has been a 21st-century campaigner.

“I’m a sort of Trumpian anti-Trumpian. My whole political style is to get out of Westminster and talk to people on the streets,” he says. He is acutely conscious that celebrity matters in modern politics.

“When people are expressing their views on certain candidates, a lot of those views are just to do with recognition,” he says. “Part of the issue here is that Boris [Johnson, the former foreign secretary and the frontrunner in the race to replace May] is frankly just much more famous.”

“We’ve got to get on to the stage of letting people look at policies,"" he says. “I’m beginning to get to the stage where people cross the street to say hello to me. But that’s only through the last few days through social media.”

MPs will vote on candidates starting next week, eliminating the least popular in a series of ballots, with the last two to undergo a monthlong election campaign followed by a vote by the approximately 124,000 members of the Conservative Party. Under new rules, anyone with eight or more MP backers can stand.

“His video clips are bemusing … he hasn’t a hope of winning and probably knows it, but he does look as if he’s having a good time"" — One Brexiteer MEP

So far, Stewart has only four endorsements, albeit three of them from heavyweights: Justice Secretary David Gauke; the Conservatives' longest-serving MP Ken Clarke; and Winston Churchill’s grandson, Conservative MP Nicholas Soames.

The Stewart campaign team say they are confident of getting past the first hurdle of eight MP supporters, at least.

“He’s very, very clever, very articulate and has an extraordinary amount of courage,” said Gauke. “He’s an extraordinary figure. You just have to read his Wikipedia page … what he had done by the time he was 30. At that point in my life I was completing financial services authority applications for a city law firm.”

446,Brussels puts Italy on notice for breaching EU spending rules,Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli,"Valdis Dombrovskis | Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images Brussels puts Italy on notice for breaching EU spending rules Economic indicators ‘all flashing red,’ European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis says.

The European Commission on Wednesday took the first step in launching a disciplinary process against Italy over the populist government's defiance of EU spending rules.

The move came six months after the Commission and the Italian government struck a compromise to avoid triggering the process, which could lead to a €3.5 billion fine, although Brussels has shied away from imposing such penalties in the past.

The Commission's decision to launch the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), a program intended to bring government spending back in line with EU rules, highlighted Rome's isolation on the EU stage. Also on Wednesday, the Commission released Spain from the procedure, meaning Italy is the only country now with a financial black mark against it from Brussels.

“We look at [Italy’s] main macroeconomic indicators, and they are all flashing red ... [the] budget deficit is growing, public debt is growing, growth is slowing down,” European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels.

Dombrovskis lamented “the damage recent policy decisions are doing” to the Italian economy.

The Commission will now ask the Council of the EU to formally launch the EDP

But the Italian government — made up of the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5Star Movement — sounded a defiant note, saying higher public spending is necessary to reboot Italy's struggling economy.

""We don't want other [countries'] money, we just want to invest in jobs and growth,"" Matteo Salvini, deputy prime minister and League leader, said on Wednesday after the Commission's announcement.

""The only way to reduce the debt created in the past is to cut taxes and allow Italians to work more and better ... With cuts, sanctions and austerity, debt, poverty and unemployment grew. We must do the opposite,"" he added.

The 5Stars' European Parliament delegation issued a statement saying: ""The Commission is once again applying double standards... Italy is the only country at risk of being sanctioned while others — like Germany and The Netherlands — have been ignoring EU parameters with their enormous surpluses.""

The Commission will now ask the Council of the EU to formally launch the EDP. The Council is widely expected to give the green light within two weeks.

More spending

EU rules require countries to keep their public debt under 60 percent of gross domestic product and their deficit below 3 percent of GDP. While Italy's deficit is still below the 3 percent ceiling, its public debt stands at 132 percent of GDP and is projected to rise further.

The flagship policies of the two governing parties — including a pensions reform allowing workers to retire early and a so-called citizens' income for poor jobseekers passed in this year’s budget — will mean more public spending. According to the Italian treasury’s own estimates and the Commission’s forecasts, such measures will fail to trigger growth or reduce debt.

The Commission in December told Italy it could increase its budget deficit to 2.04 percent of GDP to avoid increasing the country’s debt pile. Instead, Rome’s deficit has increased to 2.5 percent this year and is set to reach 3.5 percent in 2020.

The Italian government's domestic opponents said the Commission's latest move was proof the League and 5Stars were unfit to run the economy.

Previous cases suggest Brussels’ budgetary bark is worse than its bite

""They’ve plunged the country into an abyss, and the EU is presenting the bill for their insanity,"" said Giorgio Mulé, an MP with the center-right Forza Italia party.

Rome can still avoid punishment if it convinces Brussels that it will conform to the EU’s spending rules. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, on a visit to Vietnam, promised ""we will try our best to avoid the formal opening of the excessive deficit procedure, which clearly doesn’t do our country any good.""

And the EU's commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said Brussels remains keen to talk: “My door is open ...we’re happy to discuss and listen to what [the Italians] have to say.”

Previous cases suggest Brussels’ budgetary bark is worse than its bite. Spain and Portugal, for example, escaped fines three years ago after failing to correct their budget deficits.

At least some in the Italian government are betting that Brussels will blink first once again. ""These procedures have never ended in sanctions, it was clear they were going to suggest it, but they can't ultimately sanction a government that has over 50 percent of the people on its side,"" a League official said.","Valdis Dombrovskis | Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images Brussels puts Italy on notice for breaching EU spending rules Economic indicators ‘all flashing red,’ European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis says.

448,"Czech PM Babiš under pressure from protests, parliament and EU",Siegfried Mortkowitz,"PRAGUE — Tens of thousands of people jammed into Prague’s historic Wenceslas Square late Tuesday to demand the resignation of Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his new justice minister, in one of the largest demonstrations since the Velvet Revolution.

The rally was the latest — and largest — in a series of anti-Babiš protests that have been held every week in Czech cities since he replaced Jan Kněžínek with Marie Benešová as head of the justice ministry. The change was made on April 30, one day after Czech police recommended the prime minister be charged with subsidy fraud involving €2 million in EU funds for his Stork’s Nest resort.

Protesters suspect that Benešová, an old ally of the prime minister, will suppress or delay the case. If convicted, Babiš could face between five and 10 years in prison. He has strenuously denied the charges and vowed not to resign if indicted.

Organizers said 120,000 demonstrators turned out on Tuesday evening. The scale of the protest recalled the Velvet Revolution demonstrations that ended communist rule in then-Czechoslovakia three decades ago.

Waving placards reading “We have had enough!” and “Resign!” the demonstrators also demanded that Babiš return EU funds that a preliminary European Commission audit found his Agrofert conglomerate had received illegitimately, according to a media report citing a leaked copy of the audit.

Sensing blood in the water, opposition politicians were quick to pounce, and demanded that Babiš propose a vote of confidence.

The findings, which were sent to Prague last week and made public by the daily Hospodářské noviny, concluded that Babiš had breached conflict-of-interest rules in connection with subsidies paid to the holding company.

One of the richest men in the Czech Republic, Babiš placed Agrofert — a business empire encompassing more than 200 companies — in a trust two years ago. However, both Transparency International, and apparently now the EU, have found that he remains the conglomerate’s beneficial owner.

If the Commission's findings are confirmed by the official report, to be submitted later this month, the Czech Republic may have to return €17.5 million to the EU.

The audit dominated Tuesday’s session of the lower house of the Czech parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. During the debate, Babiš told MPs that the report contains no evidence of wrongdoing and that he would not return any funds to Brussels.

“I would be crazy if I did,” he said.

He went on to accuse the Commission of producing a “dubious audit,"" describing it as ""an attack on the Czech Republic, an attack on the interests of the Czech Republic, destabilizing the Czech Republic.""

He also said the audit is not signed and that he could not determine who had written it.

Opposition on attack

Sensing blood in the water, opposition politicians were quick to pounce, and demanded that Babiš propose a vote of confidence. But he refused, and challenged opposition parties to launch the vote themselves.

Babiš’s ANO movement and his coalition partners, the Social Democrats (ČSSD), have 93 MPs in the 200-seat Chamber of Deputies. The minority government survives thanks to the support of the Czech Communists, who have 15 MPs.

The chairman of the center-right ODS party, Petr Fiala, told news service iDNES that the opposition would insist that companies associated with the prime minister stop receiving subsidies, a request seconded by the Social Democrats.

In addition, both the ČSSD and ODS demanded that no government members from the prime minister's ANO party be involved in the official Czech response to the Commission's audit.

“Being in a government with a criminally charged prime minister ... is not exactly an opportunity to win votes” — ČSSD MP Radek Hlaváček

“We are really worried,” Social Democrat Deputy Chairman Ondrej Veselý told Hospodářské noviny. “Otherwise it will be a biased response and the European Commission is not interested in that.""

The Social Democrats' position is the latest in a series of indications that the relationship between the prime minister and his coalition partner could be fraying.

The Social Democrats’ disastrous showing in last week’s European election, in which they received a mere 3.9 percent of the vote and no seats in the European Parliament, has some party members questioning whether they should stay in government.

ČSSD MP Radek Hlaváček told Czech television following the election, “Being in a government with a criminally charged prime minister, a government against which the streets are demonstrating, is not exactly an opportunity to win votes.”","Protesters suspect that Benešová, an old ally of the prime minister, will suppress or delay the case.

449,Rutte vs. Trump as visions clash in The Hague,David M. Herszenhorn,"THE HAGUE — Elaine Chao, the official emissary of the Trump administration to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, wants the world’s travelers to know she feels their pain.

“For those of you who think that the secretary of transportation of the United States has a private plane, that is so not true,” Chao, who in addition to being U.S. transportation secretary happens to be married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told the high-powered audience of business owners and investors in the Netherlands on Tuesday.

“I flew here early yesterday morning in a coach middle-class seat, and it was delayed. So this is emblematic of how the secretary of transportation understands the transportation needs of people around the world,” she said.

What some in the audience, including Dutch officials who co-sponsored the summit with the United States, were trying harder to understand, however, was why the world’s richest and most powerful country doesn’t have a serious infrastructure policy, and instead tolerates life with crumbling roads and bridges, dilapidated urban transit systems, and a dysfunctional, money-losing national railroad.

Many in the audience also wondered why the U.S. opposes government-run health care, can’t stop gun violence, and elected Donald Trump, but those were questions for another day — or at least a different conference.

The entrepreneurship summit, a three-day extravaganza held in The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government, was largely intended to connect venture-takers with venture capitalists, and to promote business and investment relations between the U.S. and the Netherlands — which share a mercantilist sensibility that traces back to the days of what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in his welcoming address described as “a little settlement called New Amsterdam.”

But the event also put the spotlight on a striking difference — the U.S. conviction that government is largely an enemy of private business, which owes its primary obligation to owners and investors, and a Dutch belief, shared by many across Europe, that government has a responsibility to create conditions that are fertile for business but also serve the interests of citizens and the common good.

“I want to spend a few minutes today talking about the principles that foster entrepreneurship in any society,” Pompeo said in his welcome address at the atrium of The Hague Town Hall. “How it is that government can get out of the way, so you can all do what it is you do that makes families here in the Netherlands and families in the United States thrive and grow.”

“Government has to stop strangling business,” Pompeo added later, before going on to boast about how the Trump administration had “slashed unnecessary regulations” and “reduced corporate taxes.”

“I would guess in at least half of the meetings, if not three out of four, the question comes up: Is the U.S. still committed to the EU?” — U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra

The message from Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who spoke immediately after Pompeo, could hardly have been more different in tone.

“The Global Entrepreneurship Summit has a long-standing tradition of building connections that make the world better and at the same time make a healthy profit — connecting doing good and doing well,” Rutte told the crowd, which sipped on wine and nibbled from huge platters of Dutch and Spanish cheeses and mini hamburgers.

“Given the major challenges the world faces — climate change, food production, connectivity, energy and health — it’s crystal clear that society is your next big client,” Rutte said. “It’s clear that sustainability is by far the biggest business case of our time. And that innovation is key.”

U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra, a former U.S. congressman from Michigan, said the different outlooks were clear from the outset of the summit planning process.

“As we developed nine months ago the Dutch were pushing much more about social good, solving global challenges and all of those type of things, and we’re much more talking about creating the environment for entrepreneurship, how important entrepreneurs are and all those kinds of things,” Hoekstra said in an interview.

“And I think in the end we kind of came to a place that we’re both very happy with, where we are talking about entrepreneurship, investment, risk-taking and those types of things, and at the same time, saying how can entrepreneurship help address what we all recognize are some global challenges.’

Hoekstra acknowledged that there is an undercurrent of unease running through the U.S.-Dutch relationship in the era of Trump — one that was evident in Pompeo’s meetings on Monday with top Dutch political and business leaders and other stakeholders.

“I would guess in at least half of the meetings, if not three out of four, the question comes up: Is the U.S. still committed to the EU,” Hoekstra said. “And the answer, it’s more powerful coming from the secretary, but it’s the same one I’ve been giving for the last 16 months that I have been here: Of course, we are still committed to the EU.”

Infrastructure issues

Anxiety over Trump notwithstanding, the stark difference in sensibility between the Americans and Europeans organizing the summit can be understood partly by answering the question about infrastructure.

As a candidate for president, Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, but with no tax increases and dependent largely on private investment. It was one of Trump’s few proposals that Democrats quickly embraced, though they insisted that it would require what the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called “a significant increase in federal spending.”

Chao, who served in senior posts during the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and as labor secretary during all of President George W. Bush’s time in office, could have had virtually any Cabinet position. But joining the Transportation Department came with an added benefit for her husband, McConnell: insuring that no bloated infrastructure bill would ever reach his Republican-controlled Senate.

Trump’s relationship with Democrats has soured to the point that it is difficult to imagine any infrastructure bill moving forward. But even amid the animosity, the size of a potential plan doubled to $2 trillion — a figure viewed as absurd by McConnell and other Republicans who typically oppose most increases in domestic spending other than on tax cuts and the military.

“We could just say stop, everybody don’t move and everybody is safe. Obviously that’s not the goal” — U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao

That talk of a huge infrastructure program would likely never move beyond talk was clear in Chao’s remarks in The Hague, which avoided reference to any concrete plans and instead focused on pie-in-the-sky — or rather pie-in-space — aspirations.

“All of us want to have less congestion on the roads, a smarter way in which to commute, work and live so that we can really pay attention to what is important to us — our families, our communities,” Chao said. “And as we talk about the transportation system of the future, I am very cognizant that we have got to do things in a smarter way.”

“This involves, as I just mentioned, automated vehicles drones … space,” Chao said. “We will soon be traveling by space.”

It was quite a bold proclamation for a country that can’t seem to rid its capital of potholes nor manage a subway system that isn’t plagued by breakdowns and delays.

Droning on

Chao used part of her prepared remarks to drone on about drones. “The potential of drones to save lives by doing jobs that would otherwise put human beings at risk and to deliver goods and services more efficiently is especially noteworthy,” she said, adding that the U.S. is working to allow drones “to fly at night, to fly over the heads of people under certain conditions, identifying the safety and security threats posed by drones and how to mitigate those threats to reap the most benefits.”

It was a filibuster that would make her senator husband proud.

At another point, Chao talked about the U.S. view toward regulation, which she described as an effort “to address legitimate public concerns about safety, security and privacy without hampering innovation.”

“We could just say stop, everybody don’t move and everybody is safe,” Chao said. “Obviously that’s not the goal.” (That reluctance to interfere was displayed recently when Trump hesitated to ground Boeing’s eight 737 MAX planes after two major crashes, even as other countries moved more swiftly to ban them from flying.)

U.S. citizens are unlikely to ever see a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, but the audience at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit got insight into the differences in U.S. and European thinking.

Chao did not talk about any government responsibility to address the concerns raised by Rutte. By contrast, Carlos Moedas, the European commissioner for research, science and innovation, who appeared on a panel with Chao, talked about the challenge that regulators face in staying ahead of technology.

“How can you regulate things that you don’t know yet?” Moedas asked. “How can you regulate the future? You have to leave space for regulation … not to regulate products, but to regulate principles.”

It is a question that much of the world has wrestled with as new social media platforms have been turned into weapons of disinformation and election-meddling.

But Chao, invoking American values, stressed a lighter touch. “We’re not top-down, we’re not command and control,” she said, adding: “The government is not in the business of picking technology winners and losers and aren’t you relieved.”

The audience, responding with silence, did not seem relieved at all.","THE HAGUE — Elaine Chao, the official emissary of the Trump administration to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, wants the world’s travelers to know she feels their pain.

450,Rutte vs. Trump as visions clash in The Hague,Tom-Jan Meeus,"THE HAGUE — Elaine Chao, the official emissary of the Trump administration to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, wants the world’s travelers to know she feels their pain.

“For those of you who think that the secretary of transportation of the United States has a private plane, that is so not true,” Chao, who in addition to being U.S. transportation secretary happens to be married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told the high-powered audience of business owners and investors in the Netherlands on Tuesday.

“I flew here early yesterday morning in a coach middle-class seat, and it was delayed. So this is emblematic of how the secretary of transportation understands the transportation needs of people around the world,” she said.

What some in the audience, including Dutch officials who co-sponsored the summit with the United States, were trying harder to understand, however, was why the world’s richest and most powerful country doesn’t have a serious infrastructure policy, and instead tolerates life with crumbling roads and bridges, dilapidated urban transit systems, and a dysfunctional, money-losing national railroad.

Many in the audience also wondered why the U.S. opposes government-run health care, can’t stop gun violence, and elected Donald Trump, but those were questions for another day — or at least a different conference.

The entrepreneurship summit, a three-day extravaganza held in The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government, was largely intended to connect venture-takers with venture capitalists, and to promote business and investment relations between the U.S. and the Netherlands — which share a mercantilist sensibility that traces back to the days of what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in his welcoming address described as “a little settlement called New Amsterdam.”

But the event also put the spotlight on a striking difference — the U.S. conviction that government is largely an enemy of private business, which owes its primary obligation to owners and investors, and a Dutch belief, shared by many across Europe, that government has a responsibility to create conditions that are fertile for business but also serve the interests of citizens and the common good.

“I want to spend a few minutes today talking about the principles that foster entrepreneurship in any society,” Pompeo said in his welcome address at the atrium of The Hague Town Hall. “How it is that government can get out of the way, so you can all do what it is you do that makes families here in the Netherlands and families in the United States thrive and grow.”

“Government has to stop strangling business,” Pompeo added later, before going on to boast about how the Trump administration had “slashed unnecessary regulations” and “reduced corporate taxes.”

452,The Yellow Jackets blinded by police weapons,Pauline Bock,"Franck Didron was on the phone with his mother when he was blinded in the right eye. It was December 1, three weeks after the Yellow Jackets movement erupted on the streets of France, and the 20-year-old was attending his first big march in Paris. “I turned my head and was shot,” he recalled. “Next thing I knew, I was on the ground.”

Didron’s eye was punctured by a rubber bullet fired from controversial launchers known as lanceurs de balles de défense — or, more commonly, LBDs — used by French police despite growing criticism from human rights groups. Seconds earlier, he had reassured his mother that everything was alright.

His is not an isolated case: Since the first Yellow Jackets protest last November, 24 people have been blinded in one eye and 283 sustained other head injuries as a result of police weapons, mostly LBD-fired bullets, according to David Dufresne, an independent journalist who keeps count of the injuries for the news site Médiapart. The French interior ministry, which does not keep individual counts of specific types of injury, said that as of May 13, 2,448 protesters and 1,797 police had been wounded.

Since the first protest six months ago, the Yellow Jackets movement has grown from a demonstration against a fuel tax raise into an at times violent revolt against President Emmanuel Macron and his economic policies. The scale of the protests eventually forced Macron to backtrack on the fuel tax and organize a “great national debate” for citizens to air their grievances. His attempts at dialogue were overshadowed by violence, however, as riots erupted on the Champs-Élysées and French police countered with a severe crackdown.

The heavy-handed police tactics sparked an outcry, and became a secondary driving force, along with economic discontent, for the weekly protests. While the police have been criticized for failing to stop the marches from spiralling out of control, many — including the country's human rights watchdog — see the police response, and the use of weapons such as LBDs, as disproportionate. As the number of serious injuries mounted, the issue of police violence became a mainstay of political debate in France.

“We urgently demand an in-depth investigation into the reports of excessive use of force [in France]"" — Michelle Bachelet, U.N. high commissioner for human rights

“Sixty people lost an eye to police violence in the last 20 years, 24 of them since November,” Dufresne said. “That’s a third in six months.” Until recently, the French police’s motto was to never get in contact with protesters, but they seems to have changed tactics, he added.

The interior ministry confirmed to POLITICO that the police had changed their approach. “The evolution of pacific protests into marches in which violent elements systematically try to provoke riots has led security forces to introduce new tactics: mobility, immediate dispersion of violent gatherings, arrests,” the ministry said, adding that police observed “the principles of absolute necessity and strict proportionality.”

The French police also use GLI-F4 tear-gas grenades, which contain 25 grams of TNT each. Their use in Yellow Jacket marches has led to five people losing a hand and caused the death of one elderly woman, after a grenade was thrown into her flat just as she was closing her window. France is the only European country to use such grenades for law enforcement and one of the few to use rubber-bullet launchers.

A number of human rights bodies — among them France’s Human Rights League and Défenseur des Droits, Amnesty International, the Council of Europe and the United Nations — have urged French authorities to stop using LBDs.

“We urgently demand an in-depth investigation into the reports of excessive use of force [in France],” the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in March.

‘My life is over’

In April, the French government responded to the U.N.: “At no time are LBD guns used against protesters, even passionate ones, if they do not commit physical violence towards the police or serious damages. If they do, then they are no longer protesters but participants in a violent and unlawful gathering.”

The 24 “mutilés” (“mutilated”) — as those who have lost their sight in one eye or a hand call themselves — beg to differ. Didron is adamant he was not behaving in a violent manner when he was hit, saying he was on the phone and barely had time to realize police were closing in around him.

He had made the trip to Paris from Haute-Marne in eastern France, where he used to work as a landscape gardener. Fired when the company went under, he has since taken on small jobs to make ends meet, albeit with difficulty. “I was marching to protect my future, everyone’s future,” he said. “Now I’m 20 and I’ve lost my eye. My life is over.”

All of the “mutilated” who spoke to POLITICO deny participating in violence, although some of them attended protests that later erupted in violence. David Breidenstein, a 40-year-old factory worker from Troyes in eastern France, said he was trying to walk away from a heavy cloud of tear gas at the March 16 Paris protest when he was hit in the head by a rubber bullet. “It felt like a block of concrete shot at point-blank range,” Breidenstein, now blind in his left eye, recalled.

Gwendal Leroy, 27, had just helped arrange an ambulance to pick up an injured Yellow Jacket at a protest in Rennes on January 19 and was crossing the street to leave the march when a tear-gas grenade exploded behind him. He is not sure whether his eye was hurt by the grenade or a simultaneous LBD shot. “The last thing I saw with my left eye is the explosion,” he said.

“We are not thugs, fascists, radicalized, as the government claims. We’re unemployed, workers, students, pensioners"" — Gwendal Leroy, 27, injured protester

Patrice Philippe, a 49-year-old hauler from Lons in southwestern France, had decided to come to Paris on December 8 to “support people who are struggling” even though he himself was not in any financial difficulty. He recounted walking toward police to ask them if he could leave the protest, which he said had turned “oppressive,” when he felt the shockwave of a grenade landing near him, right before a rubber bullet hit his eye.

“On that day I saw where our freedoms end,” Philippe said. It was his first-ever protest.

Along with others injured in the protests, they have formed a support group — called “Les mutilés pour l’exemple” (“mutilated to serve as an example”) — for victims of police violence. In their manifesto, they vow to “fight for justice and to ban these weapons of war.” That might sound extreme, but LBDs, when exported, fall under the same international classification as weapons of war, as the newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné reported.

The French interior ministry told POLITICO that LBDs are “weapons of intermediate force” and fall into a category that includes weapons “designed specifically for military use or law enforcement.”

Crowd control

“We are not thugs, fascists, radicalized, as the government claims,” Leroy said. “We’re unemployed, workers, students, pensioners. We’re just starving and trying to get heard, and they don’t care.”

With the Yellow Jackets determined to keep marching, there seems to be no end in sight for the weekly cycle of violence, which Philippe, the hauler, likes to call “the war on Saturdays.” He hopes the French government will clamp down on heavy-handed policing. “They hold all the cards,” he said. “Just let people march.”

The interior ministry said it has “always called for responsibility and exemplarity among police forces,” adding: “It has always been said that every injury, in the ranks of the police or the Yellow Jackets, was an injury too many and that if there was wrongdoing, a sanction should follow.”

Yet the French government has generally been coy about police violence, further enraging the Yellow Jackets. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner in particular has drawn protesters’ ire for playing down heavy-handed police tactics. In January, weeks after Didron and Philippe had lost an eye, Castaner said: “I know of no police officer who has attacked Yellow Jackets.”

In February, Castaner took part in a television show in which his role was to explain politics to school children. On a drawing of a human silhouette, he circled the body parts “allowed” as targets for police to shoot at for crowd control — arms, legs, never the head — and said there had been only “a dozen accidental occurrences” of people shot in the face. At the time, Dufresne’s count included 195 head injuries.

Last month — when Dufresne’s count had reached 23 lost eyes, five lost hands and 233 head injuries — Castaner said that “if there had been failings [on the police side], sanctions would follow,” but added that these failings had been only “marginal” so far.

A month later, the minister landed in hot water for claiming that protesters had “attacked” medical staff at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital during the Paris Labor Day march, which was later proven false: The protesters, it turned out, had entered the hospital to evade a “hoop net,” a police tactic that traps marchers within a certain perimeter.

Castaner later said he “should not have used” the word “attack,” adding: “I should have said ‘violent intrusion.’”

Mistrust

The French police’s harsh crowd-control methods predate the presidency of Emmanuel Macron: They were already applied in 2016, when his predecessor François Hollande’s government faced protests against its labor law reform.

“That’s when the current repressive system became visible, with the ‘hoop net’ tactic and the use of mutilating weapons, which weren’t used previously,” said Vincent Denis, a professor of modern French history at the Sorbonne, adding that the “hoop net” technique was counter-productive as it panicked protesters, leading to escalation.

Denis also criticized the police for distributing LBDs to “people who are not trained in their use.” Protesters report numerous LBD shots fired by the police’s anti-criminality brigade (BAC), which was among the police departments called in for reinforcement during protests.

The interior ministry said police undergo regular weapons tests and the deployment of LBD guns is “temporary, answers the demands of a specific mission, under hierarchic authority, handled under strict control” and “exclusive to active officers with individual weapon use clearance.”

The protesters’ mistrust of the police grew after several cases when footage from surveillance cameras that could have identified the officers responsible was found to be unusable — with recordings either missing, as in Didron’s case, or cameras filming at another angle, as in Leroy’s.

Didron sometimes feels anger toward the police, but mostly wants answers. “I wish the policeman who did this to me would explain why. Just so I understand,” he said.

Leroy said he was not angry at the policeman who injured him, explaining that he knew he would never be sanctioned so he’d “rather skip the hate stage” of coping with the incident. Despite his injury, he professed sympathy for the national police, the gendarmerie — whom many protesters consider more moderate — going as far as to call on them to join in the marches.

The members of the “mutilated” association try to help each other as best they can, but they say losing an eye is often an isolating experience, even with group support. “We meet the problem head on, but we all cry separately,” said Philippe.

“If the authorities want to stop violence, we can all sit at a table and talk. They admit their mistakes and we’ll admit ours"" — Patrice Philippe, 49, injured protester

The “mutilated” say they are grappling with severe migraines, low morale and a feeling of being trapped at home, as driving is prohibited for six months after such an injury and the remaining functional eye shows little tolerance to light. “I spend most of my days in the dark,” said Breidenstein, the factory worker, “because my other eye gets tired very quickly. I cannot do anything, it’s awful. I’m going crazy, alone in the house.”

When questioned about the police response, the government has pointed to violence by Yellow Jackets marchers who ransacked the Arc de Triomphe and torched luxury shops and the fancy Fouquet’s restaurant along the Champs-Élysées. In his New Year’s Day address, Macron denounced the protesters as “thugs.”

Most Yellow Jackets don’t condone these violent elements, nor do they deny that violence exists on their side too, but they consider the police response — and the lack of sanctions for police officers acting out of line — to be out of proportion.

Philippe, the hauler who lost an eye attending his first protest, described the violent groups as a necessary element to protect the marchers from the police — the movement’s “own armed forces,” he called them.

453,The Yellow Jackets blinded by police weapons,Sarah Wheaton,"Franck Didron was on the phone with his mother when he was blinded in the right eye. It was December 1, three weeks after the Yellow Jackets movement erupted on the streets of France, and the 20-year-old was attending his first big march in Paris. “I turned my head and was shot,” he recalled. “Next thing I knew, I was on the ground.”

Didron’s eye was punctured by a rubber bullet fired from controversial launchers known as lanceurs de balles de défense — or, more commonly, LBDs — used by French police despite growing criticism from human rights groups. Seconds earlier, he had reassured his mother that everything was alright.

His is not an isolated case: Since the first Yellow Jackets protest last November, 24 people have been blinded in one eye and 283 sustained other head injuries as a result of police weapons, mostly LBD-fired bullets, according to David Dufresne, an independent journalist who keeps count of the injuries for the news site Médiapart. The French interior ministry, which does not keep individual counts of specific types of injury, said that as of May 13, 2,448 protesters and 1,797 police had been wounded.

Since the first protest six months ago, the Yellow Jackets movement has grown from a demonstration against a fuel tax raise into an at times violent revolt against President Emmanuel Macron and his economic policies. The scale of the protests eventually forced Macron to backtrack on the fuel tax and organize a “great national debate” for citizens to air their grievances. His attempts at dialogue were overshadowed by violence, however, as riots erupted on the Champs-Élysées and French police countered with a severe crackdown.

The heavy-handed police tactics sparked an outcry, and became a secondary driving force, along with economic discontent, for the weekly protests. While the police have been criticized for failing to stop the marches from spiralling out of control, many — including the country's human rights watchdog — see the police response, and the use of weapons such as LBDs, as disproportionate. As the number of serious injuries mounted, the issue of police violence became a mainstay of political debate in France.

“We urgently demand an in-depth investigation into the reports of excessive use of force [in France]"" — Michelle Bachelet, U.N. high commissioner for human rights

“Sixty people lost an eye to police violence in the last 20 years, 24 of them since November,” Dufresne said. “That’s a third in six months.” Until recently, the French police’s motto was to never get in contact with protesters, but they seems to have changed tactics, he added.

The interior ministry confirmed to POLITICO that the police had changed their approach. “The evolution of pacific protests into marches in which violent elements systematically try to provoke riots has led security forces to introduce new tactics: mobility, immediate dispersion of violent gatherings, arrests,” the ministry said, adding that police observed “the principles of absolute necessity and strict proportionality.”

The French police also use GLI-F4 tear-gas grenades, which contain 25 grams of TNT each. Their use in Yellow Jacket marches has led to five people losing a hand and caused the death of one elderly woman, after a grenade was thrown into her flat just as she was closing her window. France is the only European country to use such grenades for law enforcement and one of the few to use rubber-bullet launchers.

A number of human rights bodies — among them France’s Human Rights League and Défenseur des Droits, Amnesty International, the Council of Europe and the United Nations — have urged French authorities to stop using LBDs.

“We urgently demand an in-depth investigation into the reports of excessive use of force [in France],” the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in March.

‘My life is over’

In April, the French government responded to the U.N.: “At no time are LBD guns used against protesters, even passionate ones, if they do not commit physical violence towards the police or serious damages. If they do, then they are no longer protesters but participants in a violent and unlawful gathering.”

The 24 “mutilés” (“mutilated”) — as those who have lost their sight in one eye or a hand call themselves — beg to differ. Didron is adamant he was not behaving in a violent manner when he was hit, saying he was on the phone and barely had time to realize police were closing in around him.

He had made the trip to Paris from Haute-Marne in eastern France, where he used to work as a landscape gardener. Fired when the company went under, he has since taken on small jobs to make ends meet, albeit with difficulty. “I was marching to protect my future, everyone’s future,” he said. “Now I’m 20 and I’ve lost my eye. My life is over.”

All of the “mutilated” who spoke to POLITICO deny participating in violence, although some of them attended protests that later erupted in violence. David Breidenstein, a 40-year-old factory worker from Troyes in eastern France, said he was trying to walk away from a heavy cloud of tear gas at the March 16 Paris protest when he was hit in the head by a rubber bullet. “It felt like a block of concrete shot at point-blank range,” Breidenstein, now blind in his left eye, recalled.

Gwendal Leroy, 27, had just helped arrange an ambulance to pick up an injured Yellow Jacket at a protest in Rennes on January 19 and was crossing the street to leave the march when a tear-gas grenade exploded behind him. He is not sure whether his eye was hurt by the grenade or a simultaneous LBD shot. “The last thing I saw with my left eye is the explosion,” he said.

“We are not thugs, fascists, radicalized, as the government claims. We’re unemployed, workers, students, pensioners"" — Gwendal Leroy, 27, injured protester

Patrice Philippe, a 49-year-old hauler from Lons in southwestern France, had decided to come to Paris on December 8 to “support people who are struggling” even though he himself was not in any financial difficulty. He recounted walking toward police to ask them if he could leave the protest, which he said had turned “oppressive,” when he felt the shockwave of a grenade landing near him, right before a rubber bullet hit his eye.

“On that day I saw where our freedoms end,” Philippe said. It was his first-ever protest.

Along with others injured in the protests, they have formed a support group — called “Les mutilés pour l’exemple” (“mutilated to serve as an example”) — for victims of police violence. In their manifesto, they vow to “fight for justice and to ban these weapons of war.” That might sound extreme, but LBDs, when exported, fall under the same international classification as weapons of war, as the newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné reported.

The French interior ministry told POLITICO that LBDs are “weapons of intermediate force” and fall into a category that includes weapons “designed specifically for military use or law enforcement.”

Crowd control

“We are not thugs, fascists, radicalized, as the government claims,” Leroy said. “We’re unemployed, workers, students, pensioners. We’re just starving and trying to get heard, and they don’t care.”

With the Yellow Jackets determined to keep marching, there seems to be no end in sight for the weekly cycle of violence, which Philippe, the hauler, likes to call “the war on Saturdays.” He hopes the French government will clamp down on heavy-handed policing. “They hold all the cards,” he said. “Just let people march.”

454,Trump’s method to the madness on trade,Luiza Ch. Savage,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump is not winging it.

Or at least he's not totally winging it.

However improvisational his daily machinations on trade — presented publicly as motivated by a random mix of mood and twitches of the news cycle, including the latest threat of tariffs against Mexico — Trump and his team are acting on a well-developed theory of the case, one that has been decades in the making.

In Trump's case, that strategy is intuitive. He's been saying since the 1980s — and by all evidence genuinely believes — that the United States is letting itself be played for the fool by foreign adversaries, on trade specifically and global competition generally. Strong nations robustly protect domestic industries and keep foreign competitors at heel. Back in the '80s his focus was more typically Japan; in recent years, but long before 2016, he's been focused on China.

In the case of his advisers, the theory of the case is more intellectual. They believe that the big bet free-trade advocates made in the 1990s — that welcoming China into the WTO would encourage it to integrate into a rules-based global economy — has proved to be a loser. China, by these lights, is happy to take advantage of the U.S. and other players' commitment to free trade and rules but will continue to steal and subsidize to advance its own interests.

""I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us"" — Michael Pillsbury, influential adviser to the Trump administration on China

This method to the apparent madness has emerged in interviews for the new Global Translations podcast — which launched Thursday — with people who have worked for Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

""I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us,"" said Michael Pillsbury, an influential adviser to the Trump administration on China and author of the book, ""The Hundred Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.""

""I finally woke up,"" he said. ""But I would not say everybody's awakened even at this point.""

The Trump doctrine marks a repudiation of decades of U.S. trade orthodoxy that reached its high point in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, and capitalism and liberalism appeared on the march. This ""End of History"" euphoria culminated in Clinton pushing past his party's populist instincts on trade and embracing the elite view that the world was becoming more integrated, more rules-based, and more prosperous, and that this meant good things both for America and the rest of humanity.

In 1993, he signed into law NAFTA, which had been negotiated by the Bush administration, and enabled China's accession into the WTO, stating in a 2000 speech: ""By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people — their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.""

That democratic dream now appears dead — and with it American patience to wait for China to reform itself.

The China hawks in the White House believe now is the best — and perhaps last — moment for the U.S. to take dramatic economic action against China, even at the cost of roiling markets and upending a strong U.S. economy.

And they have tethered the rest of U.S. trade policy — the demands of Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan — to an aggressive agenda of increasingly squeezing China out of global supply chains while pressing for structural change in Beijing. When U.S. business leaders have warned, cajoled, and pleaded about the economic risks of a trade war, they have been rebuffed with the argument that it is precisely the strong economy that has wedged open a historic window of opportunity to make the move.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has described China as an ""existential problem,"" wants to use U.S. economic leverage to demand serious structural changes in China — while the U.S. still has that leverage.

The urgency behind the strategy concerns technology: China's attempts to supercharge the growth of nascent tech industries by subsidizing them and forcing the handover of U.S. intellectual property. The goal is to leapfrog from its past status as a developing nation exporting cheap plastic wares to a leader in strategic emerging technologies that will define the next technological age — such as 5G and the next-generation internet, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

It's really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right"" — Dan Ujczo, trade lawyer

China has copied U.S. technology, sometimes by requiring joint ventures and the sharing of intellectual property and other times by outright theft. The end of these forced technological transfers is Lighthizer's central aim — even if they mean that soybean farmers will pay the price. If America fails to do so and becomes ""No. 2 in technology,"" he told a congressional hearing in February, ""then the world is going to look very different for our children.""

Pillsbury, the Trump adviser, said the administration fears not only losing a commercial rivalry — but enabling an Orwellian future in which an authoritarian Beijing controls global surveillance, directs online speech and embeds government control into the very plumbing of the internet.

""Their idea is the whole world will have this combination of [surveillance] cameras, your shopping patterns, what magazines you subscribe to, who your friends are, where you go based on your cell phone being geolocated,"" with the aim of creating a social credit score, he said. ""To what degree do you support the Communist Party of China? Have you ever criticized anything? And then when you apply to get a loan or to go to college or to do anything, your social credit score will tell how the government's going to treat you.""

""Everybody in the world will be under this kind of system,"" Pillsbury said of the authoritarian vision of the future.

Increasingly, the U.S. military is concerned, too. The 2018 national security strategy, signed by former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, asserts that China seeks ""regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.""

This big picture explains in part why the Trump administration has been willing to wrest open trade relations with allies in order to remake the terms of global trade — it's not just about a better bilateral deal for the U.S., but about a particular approach to China. Take the steel tariffs against Canada and Mexico that were aimed at ""closing the back door"" to subsidized steel from China, among other places; and the insertion of language in the new North American agreement that would expel a country from the agreement if it entered into a free-trade deal with a ""non-market economy,"" or new requirements aimed at reducing the share of Chinese parts in North America car production. Likewise, the administration will have China in mind as it opens talks with Japan and Europe.

In Trumpland, the long-term goals apparently outweigh the short-term chaos and pain.

Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, recalled a meeting with senior Trump administration officials and groups representing industries affected by tariffs, who argued that the effects of Trump's economic policies would be undone by a trade war. ""It was really one of the most brilliant presentations I've ever seen — PowerPoint graphics, the whole thing — that said, 'If you do this, administration, if you do what you're talking about doing on trade,"" he recalled, ""you're going to take back all the economic gains you've made from tax reform.""

""And everybody thought it was a mic drop moment, right? Aha! And everybody in the administration kind of looked at each other and said, 'We know. You think we don't know that?'""

Over two decades, 9/11, the wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis and recovery, made action too difficult, according to Ujczo — and the possibility of a next recession could close the window. ""If we don't do this now, when will we ever do this? It's really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right.""

While Democrats don't agree with all of Trump's tactics, long-standing concerns about China have been bipartisan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was an early opponent of China's entry into the WTO. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has long decried Chinese currency manipulation. Schumer recently tweeted, ""Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump. Don't back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.""

The Obama administration shared concerns about Chinese subsidies and technological theft but attempted to address them by negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a new agreement with 11 other nations. The idea was to encircle China by creating a free-trade zone with its neighbors and set high standards that China would eventually have to accept in order to join. In trying to sell the deal to a skeptical public in 2015, Obama said China had been ""putting out feelers"" about eventually joining the pact.

But the agreement lacked public and congressional support amid a backlash against globalization. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement after he was elected and has opted instead for an increasingly bilateral approach to confronting China — using threats, tariffs and negotiations with other nations as a way to influence China. In many ways, it was the administration's firmest rebuke of the international coalition-building approach of Republican and Democratic administrations that preceded it.

While critics of the TPP said it wasn't enough to force structural changes in China, supporters say Trump gave up a powerful tool.

""I think [it] is perhaps the most significant strategic blunder in recent American history,"" said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative under Obama. ""We've lost that position for the United States at least for now, and we have created a void, a vacuum that China is quite effectively filling at the moment.""

Trump's agenda doesn't necessarily mean an end to trade. But it does mean surrendering faith in gauzy principles and far-reaching trade protocols. Instead, go toe-to-toe with trade competitors at times and in sectors of one's own choosing — and know that adversaries won't respect you unless you prove on occasion that you are willing to inflict pain on others (and accept it yourself) to win a conflict.

And it leaves open the possibility that the confrontation with China could embolden hawks on both sides.

""Over the next year or two we're going to find out — can we have a trade deal? Can we have some kind of reconciliation with China?"" said Pillsbury. ""Or ... are we moving toward a new Cold War relationship?""","And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

The Trump doctrine marks a repudiation of decades of U.S. trade orthodoxy that reached its high point in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, and capitalism and liberalism appeared on the march. This ""End of History"" euphoria culminated in Clinton pushing past his party's populist instincts on trade and embracing the elite view that the world was becoming more integrated, more rules-based, and more prosperous, and that this meant good things both for America and the rest of humanity.

In 1993, he signed into law NAFTA, which had been negotiated by the Bush administration, and enabled China's accession into the WTO, stating in a 2000 speech: ""By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people — their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.""

That democratic dream now appears dead — and with it American patience to wait for China to reform itself.

The China hawks in the White House believe now is the best — and perhaps last — moment for the U.S. to take dramatic economic action against China, even at the cost of roiling markets and upending a strong U.S. economy.

And they have tethered the rest of U.S. trade policy — the demands of Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan — to an aggressive agenda of increasingly squeezing China out of global supply chains while pressing for structural change in Beijing. When U.S. business leaders have warned, cajoled, and pleaded about the economic risks of a trade war, they have been rebuffed with the argument that it is precisely the strong economy that has wedged open a historic window of opportunity to make the move.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has described China as an ""existential problem,"" wants to use U.S. economic leverage to demand serious structural changes in China — while the U.S. still has that leverage.

The urgency behind the strategy concerns technology: China's attempts to supercharge the growth of nascent tech industries by subsidizing them and forcing the handover of U.S. intellectual property. The goal is to leapfrog from its past status as a developing nation exporting cheap plastic wares to a leader in strategic emerging technologies that will define the next technological age — such as 5G and the next-generation internet, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

It's really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right"" — Dan Ujczo, trade lawyer

China has copied U.S. technology, sometimes by requiring joint ventures and the sharing of intellectual property and other times by outright theft. The end of these forced technological transfers is Lighthizer's central aim — even if they mean that soybean farmers will pay the price. If America fails to do so and becomes ""No. 2 in technology,"" he told a congressional hearing in February, ""then the world is going to look very different for our children.""

Pillsbury, the Trump adviser, said the administration fears not only losing a commercial rivalry — but enabling an Orwellian future in which an authoritarian Beijing controls global surveillance, directs online speech and embeds government control into the very plumbing of the internet.

""Their idea is the whole world will have this combination of [surveillance] cameras, your shopping patterns, what magazines you subscribe to, who your friends are, where you go based on your cell phone being geolocated,"" with the aim of creating a social credit score, he said. ""To what degree do you support the Communist Party of China? Have you ever criticized anything? And then when you apply to get a loan or to go to college or to do anything, your social credit score will tell how the government's going to treat you.""

""Everybody in the world will be under this kind of system,"" Pillsbury said of the authoritarian vision of the future.

Increasingly, the U.S. military is concerned, too. The 2018 national security strategy, signed by former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, asserts that China seeks ""regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.""

This big picture explains in part why the Trump administration has been willing to wrest open trade relations with allies in order to remake the terms of global trade — it's not just about a better bilateral deal for the U.S., but about a particular approach to China. Take the steel tariffs against Canada and Mexico that were aimed at ""closing the back door"" to subsidized steel from China, among other places; and the insertion of language in the new North American agreement that would expel a country from the agreement if it entered into a free-trade deal with a ""non-market economy,"" or new requirements aimed at reducing the share of Chinese parts in North America car production. Likewise, the administration will have China in mind as it opens talks with Japan and Europe.

In Trumpland, the long-term goals apparently outweigh the short-term chaos and pain.

Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, recalled a meeting with senior Trump administration officials and groups representing industries affected by tariffs, who argued that the effects of Trump's economic policies would be undone by a trade war. ""It was really one of the most brilliant presentations I've ever seen — PowerPoint graphics, the whole thing — that said, 'If you do this, administration, if you do what you're talking about doing on trade,"" he recalled, ""you're going to take back all the economic gains you've made from tax reform.""

""And everybody thought it was a mic drop moment, right? Aha! And everybody in the administration kind of looked at each other and said, 'We know. You think we don't know that?'""

Over two decades, 9/11, the wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis and recovery, made action too difficult, according to Ujczo — and the possibility of a next recession could close the window. ""If we don't do this now, when will we ever do this? It's really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right.""

While Democrats don't agree with all of Trump's tactics, long-standing concerns about China have been bipartisan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was an early opponent of China's entry into the WTO. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has long decried Chinese currency manipulation. Schumer recently tweeted, ""Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump. Don't back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.""

The Obama administration shared concerns about Chinese subsidies and technological theft but attempted to address them by negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a new agreement with 11 other nations. The idea was to encircle China by creating a free-trade zone with its neighbors and set high standards that China would eventually have to accept in order to join. In trying to sell the deal to a skeptical public in 2015, Obama said China had been ""putting out feelers"" about eventually joining the pact.

But the agreement lacked public and congressional support amid a backlash against globalization. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement after he was elected and has opted instead for an increasingly bilateral approach to confronting China — using threats, tariffs and negotiations with other nations as a way to influence China. In many ways, it was the administration's firmest rebuke of the international coalition-building approach of Republican and Democratic administrations that preceded it.

While critics of the TPP said it wasn't enough to force structural changes in China, supporters say Trump gave up a powerful tool.

""I think [it] is perhaps the most significant strategic blunder in recent American history,"" said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative under Obama. ""We've lost that position for the United States at least for now, and we have created a void, a vacuum that China is quite effectively filling at the moment.""

Trump's agenda doesn't necessarily mean an end to trade. But it does mean surrendering faith in gauzy principles and far-reaching trade protocols. Instead, go toe-to-toe with trade competitors at times and in sectors of one's own choosing — and know that adversaries won't respect you unless you prove on occasion that you are willing to inflict pain on others (and accept it yourself) to win a conflict.

And it leaves open the possibility that the confrontation with China could embolden hawks on both sides.

""Over the next year or two we're going to find out — can we have a trade deal? Can we have some kind of reconciliation with China?"" said Pillsbury. ""Or ... are we moving toward a new Cold War relationship?""","And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

456,Donald Trump plays Brexit kingmaker,Gabriella Orr,"LONDON — Donald Trump is using his U.K. state visit to anoint Brexit winners and losers.

The president on Tuesday fully cast his lot with political leaders pushing for Britain to crash out of the European Union — and in the process trampled on diplomatic norms that foreign leaders generally avoid meddling in domestic politics.

Britain is especially fragile at the moment, with Prime Minister Theresa May set to step aside in the coming days, casting doubt on how — or even if — the United Kingdom will leave the EU.

But Trump barreled into the Brexit quagmire on Tuesday. In just a matter of a few hours, he snubbed the leader of the opposition — who wants a close relationship with the EU after Brexit and if he can’t get it, advocates a second referendum on the options — in favor of meeting with two avid Brexiteers and chatting with a third.

Trump “is very interested as to who the next Conservative leader and prime minister is,” said Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, following his own meeting with the president Tuesday.

Asked about the comments at the press conference, Trump said Corbyn had asked him to meet, “and I told him no.”

But it’s not clear Trump’s pressure will win him the nationalist ally he craves in Europe.

For weeks, the discussion about May’s replacement has centered on Boris Johnson, the voluble Brexit leader and former foreign secretary who shares Trump’s penchant for headline-grabbing quotes. On Tuesday, however, it was Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who grabbed the spotlight.

Corbyn had turned down a visit to the lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace the night before saying that the U.S. president did not deserve the honor. Instead, he delivered an anti-Trump screed at a massive rally less than mile away from the president’s joint press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May.

The opposition leader said he would “fight with every last breath” to prevent American companies from carving up the U.K.’s state health system, the National Health Service. And, to cheers from the crowd, he attacked Trump over his policies on immigration, climate change, reproductive rights and international cooperation.

Asked about the comments at the press conference, Trump said Corbyn had asked him to meet, “and I told him no.”

“I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him, never spoke to him,"" Trump added. ""I think that he is ... somewhat of a negative force. I think that people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize.”

Regime change

The back-and-forth had both sides suddenly contemplating the potential U.S.-U.K. relationship under a Prime Minister Corbyn — a distinct possibility if a general election proves the only way to resolve the U.K.'s political impasse over Brexit.

The U.S. and the U.K. have long proclaimed a “special relationship” exists between the two countries. Trump used the phrase liberally and warmly during his remarks, proclaiming “the greatest alliance the world has ever known.”

But officials and diplomats quietly acknowledge these ties are fraying, strained by Brexit and Trump’s election. Corbyn’s rise to power would almost certainly further test the relationship’s strength still further.

Senior Labour officials war-gaming the prospect of Corbyn as prime minister with Trump still in the White House anticipate a rocky relationship, but not a total breakdown. A diplomatic visit like this week would still take place, one official said, but not with full state honors. Corbyn opposed the granting of a state visit and would continue to do so as prime minister.

“If he were president and Jeremy were prime minister they would find a way of working together. While of course simultaneously being a vocal critic,” the official said.

Trump allies have trouble envisioning Corbyn as prime minister, mainly because they don’t believe it will happen

Whether Corbyn would call the U.S. relationship “special” — a buzzword for post-war U.K. prime ministers — remains to be seen. He used the term in a 2017 conference speech, but did so with conditions. He warned that Trump had “threatened war and talked of tearing up international agreements.”

“If the special relationship means anything, it must mean that we can say to Washington: that way is the wrong way,” Corbyn added at the time.

Some of Labour’s criticisms of Trump — on the Iran nuclear deal, on climate change, on the importance of multilateral bodies like the United Nations — are shared by the Conservative government, and are making the transatlantic relationship more difficult.

Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies predicted the U.S.-U.K. relationship would face ""profound strain"" if Corbyn were to occupy No. 10 Downing. For one, the policies he has espoused over his lengthy political career are ""so dramatically different from what we've come to expect from the United Kingdom,"" she said.

""The more I think through what a Jeremy Corbyn premiership would look like, I think it would almost have some similar aspects to what it looked like when Trump became president,” Conley said. “You would really have a challenge for civil servants who wish to prevent dramatic shifts in policy.”

Corbyn as prime minister would add major new areas of divergence, particularly on military cooperation. Corbyn opposed last year’s airstrikes in Syria, as well as the 2011 Libya intervention. He can be counted on to maintain his lifelong opposition to U.S. foreign interventions if he became prime minister. It is also impossible to imagine Corbyn would be an ally, as May has been, in Trump’s push for NATO allies to spend more on defense.

“I imagine everybody would notice we have a tangible change. We have different policies and different priorities from the current government,” the Labour official said. Then again, the official added: “We could have Bernie.” The left-wing Democrat presidential hopeful would likely be a much more comfortable fit for a Corbyn premiership.

Trump allies have trouble envisioning Corbyn as prime minister, mainly because they don’t believe it will happen. Asked whether Trump would meet Corbyn at the negotiating table if he becomes prime minister, the White House declined to comment. Trump also did not provide a reason for rejecting Corbyn’s meeting request.

Leadership race

The president spent his time Tuesday engaging conservative politicians — one of whom, following the party’s leadership election, will become prime minister.

Trump spoke with Johnson for 20 minutes by phone Tuesday morning. They did not meet in person because of a clash with a leadership hustings among Tory MPs who will select the two nominees to replace May.

Johnson, one of the leaders of the official Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, further bolstered his hardline Brexit credentials when he resigned from May’s Cabinet in protest at her concessions to the EU. The president's team also requested a sit-down meeting with Environment Secretary Michael Gove, another leader of the official Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum.

But with Trump and Corbyn’s public spat on Tuesday, the president’s allies were forced to confront the possibility of a future Corbyn-led Britain.

May quickly pointed out that what was included in a scope of any deal would be the subject of negotiation

One ex-Trump aide suggested the Labour leader isn’t particularly popular within his own party after it suffered heavy losses in last month’s European Parliament election. “He’s as well-liked within his party as Hillary Clinton was with Democrats” in 2016, the ex-aide said.

The White House has been careful not to press too hard on issues where May’s successor — whether it’s Johnson, or a handful of other potential candidates — might diverge from Trump, like healthcare and climate change.

Trump was noticeably quiet on the latter issue during his press conference with May. He also didn’t make waves after discussing the topic over tea on Monday with Prince Charles, a major proponent of climate rules and the Paris climate accord.

On trade though, Trump was typically robust. “When you are dealing with trade everything is on the table, so NHS [National Health Service] or anything else… but everything will be on the table, absolutely,” he said.

May quickly pointed out that what was included in a scope of any deal would be the subject of negotiation.

459,Donald Trump plays Brexit kingmaker,David M. Herszenhorn,"LONDON — Donald Trump is using his U.K. state visit to anoint Brexit winners and losers.

The president on Tuesday fully cast his lot with political leaders pushing for Britain to crash out of the European Union — and in the process trampled on diplomatic norms that foreign leaders generally avoid meddling in domestic politics.

Britain is especially fragile at the moment, with Prime Minister Theresa May set to step aside in the coming days, casting doubt on how — or even if — the United Kingdom will leave the EU.

But Trump barreled into the Brexit quagmire on Tuesday. In just a matter of a few hours, he snubbed the leader of the opposition — who wants a close relationship with the EU after Brexit and if he can’t get it, advocates a second referendum on the options — in favor of meeting with two avid Brexiteers and chatting with a third.

Trump “is very interested as to who the next Conservative leader and prime minister is,” said Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, following his own meeting with the president Tuesday.

Asked about the comments at the press conference, Trump said Corbyn had asked him to meet, “and I told him no.”

But it’s not clear Trump’s pressure will win him the nationalist ally he craves in Europe.

For weeks, the discussion about May’s replacement has centered on Boris Johnson, the voluble Brexit leader and former foreign secretary who shares Trump’s penchant for headline-grabbing quotes. On Tuesday, however, it was Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who grabbed the spotlight.

Corbyn had turned down a visit to the lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace the night before saying that the U.S. president did not deserve the honor. Instead, he delivered an anti-Trump screed at a massive rally less than mile away from the president’s joint press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May.

The opposition leader said he would “fight with every last breath” to prevent American companies from carving up the U.K.’s state health system, the National Health Service. And, to cheers from the crowd, he attacked Trump over his policies on immigration, climate change, reproductive rights and international cooperation.

Asked about the comments at the press conference, Trump said Corbyn had asked him to meet, “and I told him no.”

“I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him, never spoke to him,"" Trump added. ""I think that he is ... somewhat of a negative force. I think that people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize.”

Regime change

The back-and-forth had both sides suddenly contemplating the potential U.S.-U.K. relationship under a Prime Minister Corbyn — a distinct possibility if a general election proves the only way to resolve the U.K.'s political impasse over Brexit.

The U.S. and the U.K. have long proclaimed a “special relationship” exists between the two countries. Trump used the phrase liberally and warmly during his remarks, proclaiming “the greatest alliance the world has ever known.”

But officials and diplomats quietly acknowledge these ties are fraying, strained by Brexit and Trump’s election. Corbyn’s rise to power would almost certainly further test the relationship’s strength still further.

Senior Labour officials war-gaming the prospect of Corbyn as prime minister with Trump still in the White House anticipate a rocky relationship, but not a total breakdown. A diplomatic visit like this week would still take place, one official said, but not with full state honors. Corbyn opposed the granting of a state visit and would continue to do so as prime minister.

“If he were president and Jeremy were prime minister they would find a way of working together. While of course simultaneously being a vocal critic,” the official said.

Trump allies have trouble envisioning Corbyn as prime minister, mainly because they don’t believe it will happen

Whether Corbyn would call the U.S. relationship “special” — a buzzword for post-war U.K. prime ministers — remains to be seen. He used the term in a 2017 conference speech, but did so with conditions. He warned that Trump had “threatened war and talked of tearing up international agreements.”

“If the special relationship means anything, it must mean that we can say to Washington: that way is the wrong way,” Corbyn added at the time.

Some of Labour’s criticisms of Trump — on the Iran nuclear deal, on climate change, on the importance of multilateral bodies like the United Nations — are shared by the Conservative government, and are making the transatlantic relationship more difficult.

Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies predicted the U.S.-U.K. relationship would face ""profound strain"" if Corbyn were to occupy No. 10 Downing. For one, the policies he has espoused over his lengthy political career are ""so dramatically different from what we've come to expect from the United Kingdom,"" she said.

""The more I think through what a Jeremy Corbyn premiership would look like, I think it would almost have some similar aspects to what it looked like when Trump became president,” Conley said. “You would really have a challenge for civil servants who wish to prevent dramatic shifts in policy.”

Corbyn as prime minister would add major new areas of divergence, particularly on military cooperation. Corbyn opposed last year’s airstrikes in Syria, as well as the 2011 Libya intervention. He can be counted on to maintain his lifelong opposition to U.S. foreign interventions if he became prime minister. It is also impossible to imagine Corbyn would be an ally, as May has been, in Trump’s push for NATO allies to spend more on defense.

“I imagine everybody would notice we have a tangible change. We have different policies and different priorities from the current government,” the Labour official said. Then again, the official added: “We could have Bernie.” The left-wing Democrat presidential hopeful would likely be a much more comfortable fit for a Corbyn premiership.

Trump allies have trouble envisioning Corbyn as prime minister, mainly because they don’t believe it will happen. Asked whether Trump would meet Corbyn at the negotiating table if he becomes prime minister, the White House declined to comment. Trump also did not provide a reason for rejecting Corbyn’s meeting request.

Leadership race

The president spent his time Tuesday engaging conservative politicians — one of whom, following the party’s leadership election, will become prime minister.

Trump spoke with Johnson for 20 minutes by phone Tuesday morning. They did not meet in person because of a clash with a leadership hustings among Tory MPs who will select the two nominees to replace May.

Johnson, one of the leaders of the official Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, further bolstered his hardline Brexit credentials when he resigned from May’s Cabinet in protest at her concessions to the EU. The president's team also requested a sit-down meeting with Environment Secretary Michael Gove, another leader of the official Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum.

But with Trump and Corbyn’s public spat on Tuesday, the president’s allies were forced to confront the possibility of a future Corbyn-led Britain.

460,Pompeo hits Berlin for make-up talks with Merkel,Joshua Posaner,"BERLIN — It took a long time, but Mike Pompeo finally made it back to Germany.

The U.S. secretary of state served as a U.S. Army officer in Berlin in the Cold War but the city has not been top of his list of places to visit since he took office, reflecting the chilly state of relations between the Trump administration and Germany.

Pompeo upset German officials further when he abruptly canceled what would have been his first visit to the country as secretary of state three weeks ago.

But on Friday, 13 months into the job, Pompeo landed in Berlin at last for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and set about trying to smooth ruffled feathers.

""I want to especially thank you and the German government for your understanding that I had to reschedule the earlier trip, and I want to thank you for allowing me to get here so quickly,"" he told Maas at a press conference at Villa Borsig, the German foreign ministry's lakeside retreat on the outskirts of Berlin.

""Many of the challenges we are facing can only be handled in cooperation with our U.S. friends"" — German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas

""I was a young tank commander stationed here and I patrolled the then East German-West German boundary. I remember it well,"" Pompeo added. ""The German people continue to show just how much they prize security and they prize freedom.""

But the cordial tone and bucolic setting masked a difficult time in U.S.-German relations. The two are at odds over everything from military spending and trade tariffs to how to deal with Russia and Iran and settling conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.

Those differences were plain to see as recently as Thursday when Merkel laid out a very un-Trumpian view of the world in a speech at Harvard University.

On Friday, however, Maas stressed that Berlin still wants to work together with Washington on international issues. ""Many of the challenges we are facing can only be handled in cooperation with our U.S. friends,"" he said.

Opposition politicians have not been so polite. ""The German-American relationship could not be worse,” said Jürgen Trittin, a Green MP who sits on the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, as Pompeo prepared to leave for Germany. “Plain language has to be spoken this time.”

Syria support

Pompeo wasn't in Berlin to trade barbs, but looking to eke out agreements on a number of issues — not least securing ongoing German support for operations in Syria and pushing Berlin to toe the U.S. line on Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Pompeo said he had asked Germany to support U.S. efforts to develop a ""buffer zone"" in northern Syria along the border with Turkey, something Maas said wa

is up to the Bundestag to decide later this year.

On Iran, Pompeo said Tehran is flouting international rules on stopping the financing of terrorism and that airline Iran Air is acting as a ""courier"" for the government while more needs to be done to stop the ""Iranian torrent of destruction.""

But he stopped short of directly criticizing efforts in Europe to maintain the nuclear accord with Iran, which the Trump administration has abandoned. Although Washington has reimposed sanctions on Iran, Pompeo noted that humanitarian goods could still legally be traded.

On China, the two sides have a lot in common. Pompeo backed Berlin's decision to take in Chinese dissidents, while gently pushing Maas to take a harder line against Huawei and ban it from operating 5G cellular networks.

The United States says allowing Huawei to run 5G networks poses a major security risk, potentially giving Beijing access to secret information. Huawei insists it operates independently from the Chinese state.

""The internet of the future must have Western values embedded in it,"" said Pompeo, adding that one of his missions is ""to educate our friends"" of the risks posed by Chinese cyber espionage.

The comments came as Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan also visited the German capital to meet with Maas later on Friday. Berlin has so far stopped short of banning Huawei from contracts to install the next generation of cellular technology, and Maas didn't offer a firm commitment on Friday.

""We share certain concerns with regard to China,"" he said.

463,Where the Tory leadership candidates stand on Brexit,Charlie Cooper,"LONDON — The race to be the U.K.'s next prime minister is in full swing and despite candidates' attempts to present a wide array of policy ideas, there's only one issue that's going to define the contest: Brexit.

Key to each candidate's chance of success with a heavily Euroskeptic party membership will be their attitude to a clean-break, no-deal Brexit. However, many Tory MPs, who will choose the final two to fight it out in the members' ballot, will also be looking for somebody who can find a compromise approach that stands a chance of uniting the party after the endless in-fighting during Theresa May's premiership.

Few of the candidates appear to have taken seriously EU warnings that May's Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated, and only one of them is advocating a second referendum or Remain position. But there are still significant differences in their stances, broadly splitting them into two camps: Brexit true-believers who are prepared to go for no deal on October 31, and compromisers seeking an unlikely renegotiation.

Here's where they all stand on Brexit:

Michael Gove

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? Has yet to clearly state his current stance but has not pulled his punches in the past about how damaging he thinks a no-deal Brexit would be, to the U.K.’s farming sector in particular. The Telegraph cited an anonymous source as saying Gove has told colleagues that leaving without a deal on October 31 is not feasible and he is prepared to delay Brexit until the end of 2020.

Prior Brexit experience: Was a leading light in the Vote Leave campaign, put forward to contest some of the key TV debates and was seen as a safer pair of hands than Boris Johnson, if not as much of a crowd-pleaser. Was relegated to the backbenches by Theresa May in 2016 but returned as environment secretary in 2017, promising a “green Brexit.” His Brexiteer credentials, combined with this agenda and his reluctance to embrace no deal, have seen him billed as a unity candidate for the party. He backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: ""Let no one be in any doubt how difficult and damaging [no deal] would be for British farming,"" he told the National Farmers Union conference in February.

Brexit believer rating: 4/5

Sam Gyimah

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal: The most pro-EU candidate in the contest by far. Says he entered the contest to ""broaden the race"" and wants to represent the ""broad sweep of opinion"" in the U.K. on how to deal with Brexit. If he wins, he has promised to legislate for a second referendum with Remain, no-deal and Theresa May's deal on the ballot paper.

Prior Brexit experience: Not much. Was a government aide to David Cameron when he was prime minister. Subsequently held a string of junior ministerial posts, culminating in a stint as universities and science minister. He resigned from that position in November in protest at May's Brexit deal.

Key quote: ""My plan will be a new referendum with a new set of questions — to bring us together and solve the impasse,"" he said on Twitter.

Brexit believer rating: 1/5

Matt Hancock

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Has set out the most detailed plan for how he would handle Brexit of any of the candidates, in a letter to Tory MPs. He says MPs will never allow a no-deal outcome, and therefore wants to get something like the existing deal through parliament. Acknowledges that the EU is unlikely to reopen the negotiation on the Withdrawal Agreement (Hancock says any candidates who says they can ""is not being straight with you"".) Has ruled out going for a general election before delivering Brexit because it would risk a Conservative defeat and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. And said that MPs could be persuaded to back a deal if the government focuses on “alternative arrangements” to the backstop but has not been clear about what this would mean. He has ruled out going for a second referendum.

Prior Brexit experience: As health secretary in Theresa May’s Cabinet, Hancock has had responsibility for preparing the National Health Service for Brexit, most notably via contingency plans to ensure the supply of medicines in the event of no deal. He backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: “We’ve got to be brutally honest about the trade-offs … required to get a deal through this parliament,” he told BBC Radio 4.

Brexit believer rating: 2/5

Mark Harper

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Wants to leave with a deal, but if a deal that satisfies MPs is not possible then the country should leave with no deal. He told Sky News that leaving with a deal on October 31 is not a ""credible promise"" and it could be necessary to renegotiate the deal with Brussels. His main pitch is that he is a clean pair of hands who has been out of government during the May era.

Prior Brexit experience: None. But he held various junior ministerial posts in David Cameron's government culminating in a stint as chief whip.

Key quote: ""I don't think we should take the people who were responsible for where we got to now and assume they've got the solutions for how we move forward,"" he told Sky News.

Brexit believer rating: 3/5

Jeremy Hunt

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal: Has come out firmly against no deal, saying on Tuesday that to go for it would be “political suicide” for the Tory Party. Wants to renegotiate May’s deal, chiefly the backstop, with a new team including Brexiteer MPs and has cited the role that technology could play to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Believes that going for no deal would lead to parliament bringing down the government. That would trigger a general election that Labour might win.

Prior Brexit experience: Has served as foreign secretary for nearly a year, in which time he has done his bit for Brexit diplomacy (not always successfully). Is one of a small number of senior ex-Remainers to say they have some regrets about the way they voted. Backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: “Trying to deliver no deal through a general election is not a solution; it is political suicide. That would delight Nigel Farage and probably put Jeremy Corbyn in No. 10 by Christmas,” he wrote in the Telegraph.

Brexit believer rating: 2/5

Sajid Javid

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Says that the Northern Ireland border has been the ""tail that wags the dog"" and pledged to focus on negotiating changes to the Irish backstop. In a BBC interview he pledged to build ""good will"" with Dublin by offering a ""grand gesture"" to pay for the upfront and running costs of what he called a ""digitized border."" In February he insisted that the U.K.’s security would not be seriously affected while acknowledging a “change in capability” in terms of access to EU databases.

Prior Brexit experience: As home secretary, Javid played a role in Brexit contingency planning and preparing for the post-Brexit immigration system. He backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: ""I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament — that was the withdrawal agreement with a change to the backstop,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.

Brexit believer rating: 2/5

Boris Johnson

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? Has been clear that no deal is very much an option, and that the U.K. will leave on October 31 one way or another. Aides say he will seek to renegotiate May’s deal, specifically to ensure that the backstop will not be indefinite. Despite becoming, for many, the face of Brexit, some Tory MPs consider him more likely to compromise than some of the other Brexiteer candidates.

Prior Brexit experience: Was the figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, but pulled out of the 2016 leadership race before it had formally begun. He was appointed foreign secretary by May after she took office and served for two years before resigning in protest at her “Chequers” proposals for the post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Voted against May’s deal twice before backing it at the third time of asking.

Key quote: “No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table,” he wrote in the Telegraph.

Brexit believer rating: 4/5

Andrea Leadsom

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? No deal is not Leadsom’s first priority, but she has insisted that it would be “not nearly as grim as many would advocate.” She has emphasized the depth of civil service preparations for the scenario. Like Johnson, she sees October 31 as a final date by which the U.K. must leave the EU, but has pledged to put “significant effort” into securing a deal that parliament could accept before then.

Prior Brexit experience: Was another leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, and served in May’s Cabinet from the beginning, first as environment secretary, then as leader of the House of Commons. She resigned from that post just two days before May announced her own departure.

Esther McVey

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? McVey's statements on the prospect of no deal have been the most bullish of the candidates. She has ruled out any more extensions, pledged to prepare the country for no deal and will only renegotiate the deal if the EU approaches the U.K. first.

Prior Brexit experience: McVey served in the Cabinet as work and pensions secretary from January 2018 until November that same year, when she quit in protest at May’s Withdrawal Agreement.

Key quote: “If they want to have a better deal that’s fine, we’ve always wanted a free-trade agreement but what we’ve got to do is not waste time, time is limited, we have to make sure that we are ready to leave,"" she told Sky News.

Dominic Raab

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? Has rejected suggestions from Hunt and Hancock that going for no deal would lead to a general election and refused to rule out, in an interview with the Spectator, proroguing parliament (i.e. suspending the legislature) to get no-deal through. He has said he would fight for a “fairer” Brexit deal but will leave without one in October if unsuccessful.

Prior Brexit experience: Had a short spell as Brexit secretary from July 2018 until November 2018 when he quit in protest at May’s Withdrawal Agreement.

Key quote: ""I’ll fight for a fairer deal in Brussels, with negotiation to change the backstop arrangements, and if not I will be clear we’d leave on [World Trade Organization] terms in October,” he told the BBC’s ""Andrew Marr Show.""

Rory Stewart

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Has been scathing about proponents of a no-deal exit, describing WTO terms as “the worst possible … the terms that Afghanistan has been trading on,” in an uncompromising interview with PoliticsJOE. He also agrees with Hunt and Hancock that no deal would not be approved by parliament. Wants to deliver Brexit “as quickly as possible” but with a deal, delivered via a citizens’ assembly, and believes a second referendum would likely be divisive.

Prior Brexit experience: Had kept his hands relatively clean of Brexit until the leadership contest, serving as a junior minister in May’s government until May this year when he was appointed international development secretary.

Key quote: “You need a Brexit deal to last for 40 years — the danger of revoke or no deal is that you end up in a very unstable situation,” he told the Guardian.

464,Where the Tory leadership candidates stand on Brexit,James Randerson,"LONDON — The race to be the U.K.'s next prime minister is in full swing and despite candidates' attempts to present a wide array of policy ideas, there's only one issue that's going to define the contest: Brexit.

Key to each candidate's chance of success with a heavily Euroskeptic party membership will be their attitude to a clean-break, no-deal Brexit. However, many Tory MPs, who will choose the final two to fight it out in the members' ballot, will also be looking for somebody who can find a compromise approach that stands a chance of uniting the party after the endless in-fighting during Theresa May's premiership.

Few of the candidates appear to have taken seriously EU warnings that May's Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated, and only one of them is advocating a second referendum or Remain position. But there are still significant differences in their stances, broadly splitting them into two camps: Brexit true-believers who are prepared to go for no deal on October 31, and compromisers seeking an unlikely renegotiation.

Here's where they all stand on Brexit:

Michael Gove

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? Has yet to clearly state his current stance but has not pulled his punches in the past about how damaging he thinks a no-deal Brexit would be, to the U.K.’s farming sector in particular. The Telegraph cited an anonymous source as saying Gove has told colleagues that leaving without a deal on October 31 is not feasible and he is prepared to delay Brexit until the end of 2020.

Prior Brexit experience: Was a leading light in the Vote Leave campaign, put forward to contest some of the key TV debates and was seen as a safer pair of hands than Boris Johnson, if not as much of a crowd-pleaser. Was relegated to the backbenches by Theresa May in 2016 but returned as environment secretary in 2017, promising a “green Brexit.” His Brexiteer credentials, combined with this agenda and his reluctance to embrace no deal, have seen him billed as a unity candidate for the party. He backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: ""Let no one be in any doubt how difficult and damaging [no deal] would be for British farming,"" he told the National Farmers Union conference in February.

Brexit believer rating: 4/5

Sam Gyimah

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal: The most pro-EU candidate in the contest by far. Says he entered the contest to ""broaden the race"" and wants to represent the ""broad sweep of opinion"" in the U.K. on how to deal with Brexit. If he wins, he has promised to legislate for a second referendum with Remain, no-deal and Theresa May's deal on the ballot paper.

Prior Brexit experience: Not much. Was a government aide to David Cameron when he was prime minister. Subsequently held a string of junior ministerial posts, culminating in a stint as universities and science minister. He resigned from that position in November in protest at May's Brexit deal.

Key quote: ""My plan will be a new referendum with a new set of questions — to bring us together and solve the impasse,"" he said on Twitter.

Brexit believer rating: 1/5

Matt Hancock

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Has set out the most detailed plan for how he would handle Brexit of any of the candidates, in a letter to Tory MPs. He says MPs will never allow a no-deal outcome, and therefore wants to get something like the existing deal through parliament. Acknowledges that the EU is unlikely to reopen the negotiation on the Withdrawal Agreement (Hancock says any candidates who says they can ""is not being straight with you"".) Has ruled out going for a general election before delivering Brexit because it would risk a Conservative defeat and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. And said that MPs could be persuaded to back a deal if the government focuses on “alternative arrangements” to the backstop but has not been clear about what this would mean. He has ruled out going for a second referendum.

Prior Brexit experience: As health secretary in Theresa May’s Cabinet, Hancock has had responsibility for preparing the National Health Service for Brexit, most notably via contingency plans to ensure the supply of medicines in the event of no deal. He backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: “We’ve got to be brutally honest about the trade-offs … required to get a deal through this parliament,” he told BBC Radio 4.

Brexit believer rating: 2/5

Mark Harper

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Wants to leave with a deal, but if a deal that satisfies MPs is not possible then the country should leave with no deal. He told Sky News that leaving with a deal on October 31 is not a ""credible promise"" and it could be necessary to renegotiate the deal with Brussels. His main pitch is that he is a clean pair of hands who has been out of government during the May era.

Prior Brexit experience: None. But he held various junior ministerial posts in David Cameron's government culminating in a stint as chief whip.

Key quote: ""I don't think we should take the people who were responsible for where we got to now and assume they've got the solutions for how we move forward,"" he told Sky News.

Brexit believer rating: 3/5

Jeremy Hunt

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal: Has come out firmly against no deal, saying on Tuesday that to go for it would be “political suicide” for the Tory Party. Wants to renegotiate May’s deal, chiefly the backstop, with a new team including Brexiteer MPs and has cited the role that technology could play to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Believes that going for no deal would lead to parliament bringing down the government. That would trigger a general election that Labour might win.

Prior Brexit experience: Has served as foreign secretary for nearly a year, in which time he has done his bit for Brexit diplomacy (not always successfully). Is one of a small number of senior ex-Remainers to say they have some regrets about the way they voted. Backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: “Trying to deliver no deal through a general election is not a solution; it is political suicide. That would delight Nigel Farage and probably put Jeremy Corbyn in No. 10 by Christmas,” he wrote in the Telegraph.

Brexit believer rating: 2/5

Sajid Javid

How they voted: Remain

Deal or no deal? Says that the Northern Ireland border has been the ""tail that wags the dog"" and pledged to focus on negotiating changes to the Irish backstop. In a BBC interview he pledged to build ""good will"" with Dublin by offering a ""grand gesture"" to pay for the upfront and running costs of what he called a ""digitized border."" In February he insisted that the U.K.’s security would not be seriously affected while acknowledging a “change in capability” in terms of access to EU databases.

Prior Brexit experience: As home secretary, Javid played a role in Brexit contingency planning and preparing for the post-Brexit immigration system. He backed May’s deal and continues to serve in the Cabinet.

Key quote: ""I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament — that was the withdrawal agreement with a change to the backstop,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.

Brexit believer rating: 2/5

Boris Johnson

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? Has been clear that no deal is very much an option, and that the U.K. will leave on October 31 one way or another. Aides say he will seek to renegotiate May’s deal, specifically to ensure that the backstop will not be indefinite. Despite becoming, for many, the face of Brexit, some Tory MPs consider him more likely to compromise than some of the other Brexiteer candidates.

Prior Brexit experience: Was the figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, but pulled out of the 2016 leadership race before it had formally begun. He was appointed foreign secretary by May after she took office and served for two years before resigning in protest at her “Chequers” proposals for the post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Voted against May’s deal twice before backing it at the third time of asking.

Key quote: “No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table,” he wrote in the Telegraph.

Andrea Leadsom

How they voted: Leave

Deal or no deal? No deal is not Leadsom’s first priority, but she has insisted that it would be “not nearly as grim as many would advocate.” She has emphasized the depth of civil service preparations for the scenario.

465,The path to power for the UK’s next prime minister,Annabelle Dickson,"LONDON — Theresa May's authority has been draining away for weeks, but the U.K. prime minister only officially becomes a lame duck on Friday.

After first saying she would resign if she got her Brexit deal through parliament; then promising to announce her resignation at some future date; and finally setting a date for when she would actually, formally resign, the U.K. prime minister will finally step down as Conservative Party leader on June 7.

Here's what happens next:

May steps down

Don't expect any pomp and ceremony. May will remain prime minister and acting leader until her successor is chosen, meaning she will still have to face MPs at Prime Minister's Questions time each Wednesday, and represent the U.K. on the world stage. That will very likely mean heading to the European Council in Brussels and the G20 summit in Osaka later this month.

The contest

May's departure formally triggers a contest that in truth is already underway in earnest. By Monday there were 13 candidates in the running — much higher than in previous races — including serving Cabinet ministers and backbenchers who have not held ministerial office for years. By Tuesday evening two had already dropped out.

Starting gun

MPs who want to stand in the race must submit their nomination papers to the 1922 committee, the backbench grouping of Tory MPs that is running the race, between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday, June 10. Each candidate must have the backing of eight MPs to stand — a proposer, a seconder and six other MPs.

This is a change from previous contests where MPs needed only a proposer and seconder, making it easier for candidates to get up and running. The large field in this race prompted the 1922 committee to announce the rule change to pare back the field more quickly. It was backed by the Conservative Party board on Tuesday.

Whittling the field down

MPs will hold a sequence of secret ballots over the following two weeks to cut the number of contenders down to a shortlist of two. The first ballot — to be held on Thursday, June 13 between 10 a.m. and noon local time — will require candidates to win 5 percent of votes (17 MPs), while the second ballot will require 10 percent of votes (33 MPs). This is another change to the rules to speed up the process. Last time a leadership election was fought, in 2016, only the lowest placed candidate was eliminated.

This phase will start on June 13 with three more ballots scheduled on June 18, 19 and 20. The returning officers for the parliamentary stage of the leadership election are 1922 executive committee members Cheryl Gillan and Charles Walker.

Hustings

The BBC announced it would hold two televised debates with the candidates. All of the candidates in the race by mid-June will be invited to a hustings event on BBC One, and the final two will go head-to-head in a ""Question Time Special."" ITV and Sky News are also holding talks with candidates about televised hustings.

There will also be membership hustings, with the first planned on June 22. The 2005 race involved 11 regional hustings meetings for Tory members.

Head-to-head

The final two candidates selected by MPs are then put to around 124,000 Tory Party members (the last publicly available figure from 2018) on a ""one member, one vote"" basis. This stage of the process will be completed in the week beginning July 22.

In 2005, the last time the leadership was put to the members, it was conducted through a postal ballot.

New leader

Once a new leader has been selected by the Tory membership, Queen Elizabeth II will ask them to form a new administration. If they accept, they will ""kiss hands"" (the constitutional terminology for formal appointment to ministerial office) upon their appointment as prime minister and first lord of the treasury. There is no requirement for confirmation by parliament, but the new prime minister will need to quickly shore up the alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party, which provides the Conservatives with a majority.

If the winner looks like they do not have the support of MPs (some Tories have said they would leave the party if a hard Brexiteer were elected, for example) then opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn is very likely to call a no-confidence vote. That could bring down the new government and precipitate a general election.","LONDON — Theresa May's authority has been draining away for weeks, but the U.K. prime minister only officially becomes a lame duck on Friday.

468,US takes aim at the UK’s National Health Service,Helen Collis,"Few issues trigger such a national outcry in the U.K. than attacks on the country’s sacred National Health Service.

Yet the U.S. has chosen that fight.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that everything including the NHS would be on the table in a trade deal with the U.K.

In a press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump said: “I think we’re going to have a great and comprehensive trade deal.” When asked if this would include the NHS, he said: “When you’re dealing in trade everything’s on the table, so NHS or anything else… but everything will be on the table, absolutely.""

May responded quickly to state: “The point about making trade deals is of course that both sides negotiate and come to agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future,” she said.

“A trade agreement with the United States will not force the U.K. government to privatize any service"" — US official

Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has thrown his hat into the Tory leadership contest, tweeted in response to Trump’s statement: “Dear Mr President. The NHS isn’t on the table in trade talks — and never will be. Not on my watch.”

Ahead of Trump’s state visit, U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Woody Johnson said a post-Brexit trade deal would require giving the U.S. access to the U.K.'s health sector.

Cue the health secretary, foreign secretary, other politicians and numerous health care organizations coming out in defense of the U.K.’s social health care system and the need to protect it from U.S. privatization.

But with American companies already providing some services in the NHS, what does the U.S. actually want?

There are a couple of issues at play here. Brits fear more American companies bidding to provide health care services in the U.K. will lead to privatization of the NHS. But American companies can and do already bid to provide NHS services. Like all firms, they need a local subsidiary and must be registered with the care watchdog, the Care Quality Commission.

They are also working with the NHS in other ways: HCA (Health Corporation America) is a big U.S. firm running some private services from NHS hospitals and in return providing extra beds, for example.

However, it seems few U.S. companies are aware of these opportunities, in part because the rules around tendering are so complicated and opaque, according to Catherine Davies, managing partner at health care advisory consultancy Monticle.

There are fears a U.S. trade deal would shine a light on the issue, and American companies could sue the NHS if services are not put out to tender; fears that played out in the U.K. as the EU sought to secure a trade deal with the U.S. in 2016.

Niall Dickson, head of NHS Confederation, representing NHS managers and providers, said Americans are pushing for access to the NHS because they “don’t understand the social health care system.” He told the BBC Radio 4 ""Today"" program this morning that privatization won’t happen. “I think it is a fuss about nothing,” he said.

A U.S. official told POLITICO: “A trade agreement with the United States will not force the U.K. government to privatize any service, or prevent the U.K. government from expanding the range of services it supplies to the public.""

The second issue concerns U.S. pharmaceutical companies failing to get their products approved for NHS reimbursement (like Vertex and its cystic fibrosis drugs). Britons fear that U.S. meddling in processes that limit the amount the NHS pays for medicines — health technology assessments that compare the added benefit of drugs versus their cost before paying out — could hit the U.K.’s drugs bill hard.

Many other countries have also either copied the U.K. or directly rely on Britain’s assessments for their own decisions on state-financed drug reimbursements.

“The U.S. has long taken issue with the fact that the NHS’s approach to drug procurement… pulls down prices worldwide,” said Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, in an op-ed.

“The U.S. wants to put this issue on the table"" — Holger Hestermeyer, trade lawyer at King’s College London

The U.S.’s objectives for a U.K. trade deal published in February explicitly mention the U.S. would “seek standards to ensure that government regulatory reimbursement regimes … provide procedural fairness … and provide full market access for U.S. products.”

This means the U.S. would take aim at these assessments. “The U.S. wants to put this issue on the table,” said Holger Hestermeyer, a trade lawyer at King’s College London.

With pharma reps accounting for 20 percent of the 10 executives invited for a special, closed-door breakfast with Trump this morning, it seems medicines is indeed a hot-button topic.

Brown/AFP via Getty Images Austria’s bid to end online anonymity triggers crackdown fears Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has left office, but his government’s plan to end online anonymity is expected to live on.

VIENNA — Austria is coming for your hidden online identity.

Before the country's government collapsed, its ruling parties were moving ahead with a plan to fight hate speech by forcing social media users and online commenters to provide details about their real identity.

In April, the government presented a federal draft legislation, dubbed “the digital mask ban,” which would require users to register on platforms and forums by providing their names and addresses before being able to post a single comment.

The text triggered an uproar among civil society groups, corporations, opposition parties and one prominent newspaper, all of which argue that the move is a worrying step back for online freedoms that will encourage authoritarian behavior.

Now, with polls showing former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservative party on course to win reelection in September, critics fear the law is on its way back, amid broader European moves from France to the United Kingdom to restrict anonymity online.

“We have had the debate on online anonymity for several years, and now we’re moving to a phase where governments start to regulate.” — Ingrid Brodnig, Austrian digital expert

“The 'digital mask ban' is a threatening gesture towards smaller, rather government-critical online forums and a showpiece of unnecessary data retention,” said Stephanie Cox, a member of the Austrian Parliament from JETZT, a small opposition party.

Since the legislation was first put forward in April, Austria has undergone a major political crisis.

In late May, Kurz lost a confidence vote after a leaked video emerged in which the former Vice Chancellor and leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party Heinz-Christian Strache offered to trade government contracts for campaign donations from a supposed Russian millionaire. Before being ousted, Kurz called a new election in the fall.

While the composition of the future government is uncertain, there are signs the digital mask ban could survive the turmoil.

Kurz's Austrian People's Party is widely expected to win the September election. Last week, it achieved the best European election result in its history with nearly 35 percent — more than 10 percentage points ahead of its Social Democrat rivals.

“I am pretty confident that the law will come back soon after the next elections,” said Maximilian Schubert, the secretary-general of Internet Service Providers Austria, a lobby group representing Google and Facebook.

Before Kurz was ousted by the Austrian parliament, reports emerged the government was willing to go forward with the project despite the ongoing political crisis.

""The appraisal phase ended last week,"" a spokesperson for the culture ministry said in late May. ""We will look at the comments in detail and include them in our considerations.""

Kurz's party was the brains behind the project while its former coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party, was less enthusiastic, several Austrian insiders said. (Far-right parties are traditionally wary of legislation that could limit free speech.)

“The political party that drives this proposal is the conservative party, which will be aiming for continuity after this unintended snap election,” said Thomas Lohninger, the executive director of digital rights NGO epicenter.works.

Anonymity online

Whether or not this legislation survives Austria's political crisis, the project reflects a growing trend in Europe to challenge online anonymity.

In the U.K., a so-called porn block will come into effect in mid-July, requiring websites hosting pornographic material to check the users' age with official identification documents such as passports or driver's licences to ensure they are aged 18 or above.

The issue of anonymous accounts online came up during the European election campaign, when Manfred Weber, the European People Party’s candidate for the Commission top job, said he wanted users to disclose their real names on social media.

“We have had the debate on online anonymity for several years, and now we’re moving to a phase where governments start to regulate. Austria is not the only country where this is an issue,” said Ingrid Brodnig, an Austrian digital expert and the country's Digital Champion for the European Commission. She questions the efficiency of ending anonymity to tackle hate speech online.

Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said he wants to end anonymity on the internet, but stopped short of actually pushing forward legislation going in that direction.

Following in Germany’s footsteps, France’s draft text on hate speech online focuses on content moderation rather than identifying users.

By contrast, Austria’s draft legislation requires users to provide their real identities to the platforms and online forums, which are then responsible for verifying the information.

People would be allowed to use pseudonyms when posting online, but platforms could be forced to hand out the users’ private information to third parties, including private persons, seeking prosecution for defamation or other crimes.

“The chilling effect for freedom of speech is real,” said Thomas Lohninger.

“The private address of people criticizing right-wing politicians could be in the hands of whomever they have spoken about,” he said. “In an already fragile democracy, it’s another step in the Orbán direction,” he added, referring to Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

There are also concerns about whether the legislation may be in conflict with EU law.

In a contribution made during the consultation phase, which ended in late May, the country’s Supreme Court questioned whether the draft was compliant with the European Court of Justice's banning of bulk and indiscriminate data retention.

‘Convenient side effect’

The text’s critics see the project as part of a worrying trend, after Austria's parliament passed a law requiring people to provide personal details to buy pre-paid SIM cards.

The Austrian executive came up with the idea of the “digital mask ban” after the case of Sigi Maurer, a former Green MP who was sexually harassed on Facebook, made headlines in the country.

“The government always claimed it was about my case,” Maurer said, “but it has nothing to do with it.”

Critics argue that Der Standard, a prominent daily newspaper that often opposes the government, is directly targeted because of the text’s thresholds in terms of audience and revenues.

""When the government announced the legislation, we thought they were targeting Google and Facebook, like Macron and everyone else,"" ISPA’s Maximilian Schubert said. ""But when the act later surfaced, the thresholds were surprisingly close to one commercial newspaper: Der Standard.""

To fall into the legislation's scope, platforms must have more than 100,000 registered users and an annual revenue exceeding €500,000. There is an additional criteria for media companies: They are covered by the legislation if they have received more than €50,000 in press subsidies.

“Der Standard is a convenient side effect,” Maurer added.

Der Standard hosts one of the biggest online forums in Austria. If the law is adopted, the media company would be responsible for verifying the identity of every single user posting on the platform or commenting on articles, or face fines.

According to the newspaper's interpretation, the proposal is a direct attack on them and the press.

“The law is consistent with the global trend among right-wing and populist politicians, who are doing all they can to foment distrust of independent journalism and public debate,” Der Standard’s editor in chief wrote when the legislation was put forward in April.

The government rejected such accusations.

“For us, it is a matter of bringing the rule of law to a breakthrough in the digital world as a whole. All daily newspapers are covered by the law,” the spokesperson for the culture minister said.

For ISPA’s Schubert, the government’s actions are taking the country in a worrying direction.

“Austria wants to be a little Silicon Valley in the heart of Europe, but right now we are more moving towards becoming a little China,” he said.","The Austrian government presented a federal draft legislation, dubbed “the digital mask ban,” which would require users to register on platforms and forums before being able to post a comment | Frederic J.

Critics argue that Der Standard, a prominent daily newspaper that often opposes the government, is directly targeted because of the text’s thresholds in terms of audience and revenues.

""When the government announced the legislation, we thought they were targeting Google and Facebook, like Macron and everyone else,"" ISPA’s Maximilian Schubert said. ""But when the act later surfaced, the thresholds were surprisingly close to one commercial newspaper: Der Standard.""

To fall into the legislation's scope, platforms must have more than 100,000 registered users and an annual revenue exceeding €500,000. There is an additional criteria for media companies: They are covered by the legislation if they have received more than €50,000 in press subsidies.

“Der Standard is a convenient side effect,” Maurer added.

Der Standard hosts one of the biggest online forums in Austria. If the law is adopted, the media company would be responsible for verifying the identity of every single user posting on the platform or commenting on articles, or face fines.

According to the newspaper's interpretation, the proposal is a direct attack on them and the press.

“The law is consistent with the global trend among right-wing and populist politicians, who are doing all they can to foment distrust of independent journalism and public debate,” Der Standard’s editor in chief wrote when the legislation was put forward in April.

The government rejected such accusations.

“For us, it is a matter of bringing the rule of law to a breakthrough in the digital world as a whole. All daily newspapers are covered by the law,” the spokesperson for the culture minister said.

For ISPA’s Schubert, the government’s actions are taking the country in a worrying direction.

“Austria wants to be a little Silicon Valley in the heart of Europe, but right now we are more moving towards becoming a little China,” he said.","The Austrian government presented a federal draft legislation, dubbed “the digital mask ban,” which would require users to register on platforms and forums before being able to post a comment | Frederic J.

474,Europe’s record offers cautions for a US battle with Google,Mark Scott,"The U.S. Justice Department's potential antitrust investigation of Google has brought cheers from Silicon Valley’s critics on both sides of the Atlantic — but European regulators' years of battling the search giant show how hard it would be to change the company's behavior.

European Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager has exacted significant penalties from Google over the past three years, levying a combined €8.3 billion in fines on the company for unfairly favoring some of its search, mobile software and online advertising services over those of rivals. Google is appealing all three decisions.

Brussels’ decadelong pursuit of Google, combined with investigations into heavy hitters like Facebook, Amazon and Apple, has laid down a step-by-step guide for others to follow. It has also offered cause for some optimism among lawmakers and the wider public from San Francisco to Singapore about stemming Silicon Valley's growing control over everything from social media to online advertising — a model many hope the U.S. is finally ready to follow.

""Google mines and monetizes data from each facet of our lives,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, wrote on Twitter on Saturday following the news of the DOJ’s possible antitrust probe. ""Its apparent predatory practices – exploiting its behemoth power — stifle innovators and crush competitors, harming consumers.""

Still, the Justice Department has not yet said it will investigate Google. And even if it did, the outcome would probably fall well short of the demands by some critics, such as Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, for breaking up the big tech companies.

Android, the popular Google mobile software that was at the center of a record €4.3 billion EU antitrust fine last year, also is still used in roughly four out of every five smartphones worldwide.

For now, the DOJ has merely claimed jurisdiction over a possible Google probe, in an arrangement that also gives the U.S. Federal Trade Commission oversight of any potential actions involving Amazon, people close to the case have confirmed to POLITICO. (The Washington Post first reported on the Amazon development late Saturday.) Both agencies, as well as Google and Amazon, declined to comment on the matter.

Yet anyone in Washington looking to the European Union for a regulatory playbook to tackle Google will probably be disappointed.

Despite Brussels’ success in levying multibillion-euro fines against the search giant, those sanctions have not offered much help to other companies seeking to compete in the digital world where Google still dominates. The collective fines also represent a mere rounding error in the $136 billion of revenues the company generated last year — Google’s quarterly profits alone were enough to cover all of Europe's penalties combined.

Confronted with these limits, EU regulators have imposed legal obligations on Google to promote rivals in some of its search results. But Google still remains by far the largest player in the online search market in both the U.S. and Europe, with tentacles stretching across the web into flight bookings, restaurant reservations and online shopping.

It similarly continues to dominate the online advertising world — another focus of European scorn — with an expected market share of almost 40 percent by the end of this year, according to eMarketer, an analytics firm. (Silicon Valley rivals like Facebook and Amazon are also expanding aggressively into online advertising.)

Android, the popular Google mobile software that was at the center of a record €4.3 billion EU antitrust fine last year, also is still used in roughly four out of every five smartphones worldwide, based on industry figures.

In recent months, EU officials have tried to boost competition by forcing Google to offer its users alternatives to its popular search engine and other digital services when they use the company's online app store. But the company’s rivals say such tactics won't stop Google's overall dominance.

Legal experts say that any future DOJ antitrust case may be even more difficult to win than the ones in Europe because of the higher burdens of evidence required in the U.S. to prove that a company’s actions have led to specific harm to consumers.

“There’s a lot of public pressure in the United States to act,” said Ioannis Lianos, professor of global competition law and public policy at University College London. “But case law is more demanding for the plaintiff to bring evidence of consumer harm compared to in Europe.”

Some tech industry critics in the U.S. also remain skeptical that the Justice Department is willing to take on an aggressive antitrust fight, despite the Trump administration’s attempted court battle to prevent the merger between AT&T and Time Warner.

“Holding dominant platforms accountable for anti-competitive conduct is imperative, but I don’t have a lot of faith that President Trump’s Justice Department will stand up for working people against powerful corporations like Google and Facebook,"" said U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, in a statement Saturday. Cicilline has said his House judiciary subcommittee will hold hearings on tech and antitrust.

In previous statements, Google has said that its digital services are widely used by consumers worldwide and helped to support a thriving digital economy of app developers.

Another cause for skepticism is U.S. regulators’ weak track record compared with their EU counterparts. During the Obama administration, for example, the FTC shut down an antitrust probe into Google in 2013 after the company agreed to alter some of its advertising practices. A leaked document later showed that some FTC officials had wanted to pursue a case against the search giant.

In contrast, Vestager swung into action after taking over the competition file in Brussels a year later, wielding blockbuster fines, savvy marketing and an argument the tech industry was harming consumers. That included accusing Google of abusing its dominant position in the online search and advertising markets to push out rivals, tilt the table in favor of its own digital services, and force others to rely on Google’s products.

In previous statements, Google has said that its digital services are widely used by consumers worldwide and help to support a thriving digital economy of app developers.

Some of Google’s rivals have credited Europe’s aggressive stance with giving Washington a model to follow, particularly the role played by Vestager, whose antitrust tenure in Brussels will soon end.

“We wouldn’t be here without Vestager,” said Luther Lowe, vice president of public policy at Yelp, the online listing service that has been a vocal critic of Google’s online tactics in the U.S. and Europe, and whose antitrust case against the search giant is under review by officials in Brussels.

“We now see a situation where European consumers are better protected than U.S. consumers,"" he added. ""I’m not surprised we’re seeing renewed scrutiny in the U.S.""

476,The EU’s 7 post-election green priorities,Kalina Oroschakoff,"The European election didn't produce a decisive winner when it comes to political groupings — it's a different story when it comes to climate policy issues.

It's pretty clear that issues that had once been considered marginal, like imposing a fuel tax on aviation to reduce demand for flying; or very hard to achieve, like agreeing to make the bloc climate neutral by 2050, got a shot in the arm thanks to the election.

POLITICO took a look at seven environmental issues likely to benefit from the ""green wave"" and that are likely to see movement during the next Parliament and Commission:

1. Climate neutrality: Climate change was a big subject across the political spectrum. That will put pressure on EU policymakers and member countries to speed up efforts to adopt a new long-term emissions strategy and a 2050 climate objective — the outgoing European Commission proposed a goal of climate neutrality, meaning the bloc would absorb as much greenhouse gases as it emits.

The issue is now being discussed by EU countries and will be on the agenda of a European Council in June as well as in the fall and winter. It will be up to the next Commission to propose detailed legislation to implement the bloc’s mid-century goal once leaders sign off on the broad direction.

EU countries might not agree on how to reduce emissions in shipping, but they have edged closer to a consensus that it needs to happen — soon.

Under the Paris Agreement, the EU will have to submit its long-term emissions strategy in 2020, as well as communicate new or existing climate commitments.

As part of its pledge under the Paris Agreement, the EU promised to slash emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030. But that's not enough to meet the agreement's goal of limiting global warming, and now environmental campaigners, Green parties and some governments such as the Netherlands and Finland want to up the target. That's likelier to happen now that climate and environmental concerns are forcing the political mainstream — especially the European People’s Party — to boost their climate efforts.

2. Shipping and aviation emissions: The sectors are outside the Paris Agreement and were marginal to all but the staunchest climate activists. But shipping and aviation emissions are now firmly on the agenda.

EU countries might not agree on how to reduce emissions in shipping, but they have edged closer to a consensus that it needs to happen — soon. The EU is demanding action to cut maritime emissions by 2023; if not by the International Maritime Organization, then by the EU itself, putting it on the map for the next Commission.

In aviation, the Netherlands was long alone in its push for an EU-wide tax on flying — whether through a tax on airline tickets, flights or jet fuel. Rather than wait for the rest of the bloc, the country went ahead and forged plans for a €7 levy on every passenger. The Dutch said they'd drop the tax if other EU countries agreed to a bloc-wide levy. That now looks more likely.

In pre-election interviews with POLITICO, only the European Conservatives and Reformists opposed a tax on airplane fuel. But the EPP’s Manfred Weber, the S&D’s Frans Timmermans and the Liberals’ Margrethe Vestager all backed the scheme. In a debate with Timmermans, Weber said “only a few right weirdos” would deny the need for a climate policy.

3. Carbon taxes: Whether a carbon tax at Europe’s border, as proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, or a tax on dirty energy imports, as floated by Spain, or an aviation tax as advocated by the Dutch, everybody is talking about green taxes as an essential tool to slash emissions by generating a shift to renewable energy, sustainable transport and changing consumption patterns.

The outgoing Commission agrees. “The element that we are missing in our toolbox is a modern framework for energy taxation that corresponds to our level of ambition,” Energy and Climate Action Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete said in April.

But EU countries would need to give their unanimous consensus for such a tax — something the Commission is trying to change, but it will face an uphill struggle. Yet there is growing political momentum on the issue. During the campaign, both Timmermans and Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent liberal voice, backed a carbon tax — not to speak of the Greens, who have long been calling for EU-wide green taxation.

""Why are we not taxing kerosene? We are taxing the fuel in cars and trains, but not airplanes. Unacceptable,"" Timmermans said during a candidates' debate.

“The big battle will be what to do with transport and agriculture under the pressure of the climate crisis” — Benedek Jávor, departing Green lawmaker

4. Sustainable finance: Europe needs €180 billion a year in investments over the next decade to deliver on its Paris Agreement climate goals. To get that sort of cash, Brussels is seeking to shift the financial sector to more sustainable investments.

“I could well imagine sustainable finance being among the new Commission's priorities,"" said Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis back in March.

The first step will be interinstitutional negotiations on the so-called taxonomy, or definition of what counts as sustainable investment in the EU, which a new, greener Parliament could seek to strengthen. The Commission’s financial policy department is already at work on the next sustainable legislative options for the new Commission.

5. Greening agriculture: The surge of Green MEPs in the European Parliament could spur wholesale change in the EU’s reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.

Some Greens would like the Parliament’s environmental committee to share oversight over the CAP, along with the agricultural committee. Green Party officials say they want positions chairing committees that legislate reforms in farming.

”In general, climate change will become a more important issue,” said Benedek Jávor, a departing Green lawmaker from Hungary. “The big battle will be what to do with transport and agriculture under the pressure of the climate crisis.”

Jávor said that the push to cap big payments, implement strict eco-schemes and redistribute payments to smaller farmers would increase in the next Parliament.

6. Climate and trade: The strong showing by parties with strong environmental agendas in core EU countries means MEPs will demand a trade policy that factors in more safeguards on labor rights and the environment.

Only a day after the European election, French Trade Minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said that a deal with South America's Mercosur block would need safeguards against deforestation.

Until now, ""sustainable trade"" provisions in EU trade have so far come without enforcement. EU trade chief Cecilia Malmström even argued against enforcing such provisions, saying partner countries would ask for concessions in exchange.

That may change.

Another push for green trade will come from French President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance list. These new MEPs share many of the Greens’ ambitions on making sustainable trade chapters enforceable and taking environmental aspects of trade fully into account. Leading the list is French ecologist Pascal Canfin, a former Green politician who could lead the shift toward greener trade.

“Bayer and Monsanto, here we come again” — Aide to Socialist MEP Eric Andrieu following his reelection

In the Council, France and Spain are making clear they want the EU to bring its trade policy in line with its wider climate objectives. Macron’s idea of a carbon tax at Europe’s borders is also sure to attract much more attention in the coming months.

7. Pesticide clampdown: A greener European Parliament will mean greater pressure to reduce the use of pesticides across Europe — and louder protests from farmers and the chemicals industry that no real alternatives exist.

The license for glyphosate, the controversial and widely used herbicide, expires in December 2022 but the fight over whether it should be renewed will begin long before.

Key to that debate will be Socialist MEP Eric Andrieu, who chaired the pesticides committee in the last Parliament and has already stated his firm intention to battle agrichemical giant Bayer in the next five years. “Bayer and Monsanto, here we come again,” said one of Andrieu’s aides shortly after he was reelected.

If the Commission decides to tinker with the EU’s pesticides legislation, Greens will almost certainly launch a flurry of their own proposals.

“Bayer and Monsanto, here we come again” — Aide to Socialist MEP Eric Andrieu following his reelection

In the Council, France and Spain are making clear they want the EU to bring its trade policy in line with its wider climate objectives. Macron’s idea of a carbon tax at Europe’s borders is also sure to attract much more attention in the coming months.

7. Pesticide clampdown: A greener European Parliament will mean greater pressure to reduce the use of pesticides across Europe — and louder protests from farmers and the chemicals industry that no real alternatives exist.

The license for glyphosate, the controversial and widely used herbicide, expires in December 2022 but the fight over whether it should be renewed will begin long before.

Key to that debate will be Socialist MEP Eric Andrieu, who chaired the pesticides committee in the last Parliament and has already stated his firm intention to battle agrichemical giant Bayer in the next five years. “Bayer and Monsanto, here we come again,” said one of Andrieu’s aides shortly after he was reelected.

If the Commission decides to tinker with the EU’s pesticides legislation, Greens will almost certainly launch a flurry of their own proposals.

478,The EU’s 7 post-election green priorities,Eddy Wax,"The European election didn't produce a decisive winner when it comes to political groupings — it's a different story when it comes to climate policy issues.

It's pretty clear that issues that had once been considered marginal, like imposing a fuel tax on aviation to reduce demand for flying; or very hard to achieve, like agreeing to make the bloc climate neutral by 2050, got a shot in the arm thanks to the election.

POLITICO took a look at seven environmental issues likely to benefit from the ""green wave"" and that are likely to see movement during the next Parliament and Commission:

1. Climate neutrality: Climate change was a big subject across the political spectrum. That will put pressure on EU policymakers and member countries to speed up efforts to adopt a new long-term emissions strategy and a 2050 climate objective — the outgoing European Commission proposed a goal of climate neutrality, meaning the bloc would absorb as much greenhouse gases as it emits.

The issue is now being discussed by EU countries and will be on the agenda of a European Council in June as well as in the fall and winter. It will be up to the next Commission to propose detailed legislation to implement the bloc’s mid-century goal once leaders sign off on the broad direction.

EU countries might not agree on how to reduce emissions in shipping, but they have edged closer to a consensus that it needs to happen — soon.

Under the Paris Agreement, the EU will have to submit its long-term emissions strategy in 2020, as well as communicate new or existing climate commitments.

As part of its pledge under the Paris Agreement, the EU promised to slash emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030. But that's not enough to meet the agreement's goal of limiting global warming, and now environmental campaigners, Green parties and some governments such as the Netherlands and Finland want to up the target. That's likelier to happen now that climate and environmental concerns are forcing the political mainstream — especially the European People’s Party — to boost their climate efforts.

2. Shipping and aviation emissions: The sectors are outside the Paris Agreement and were marginal to all but the staunchest climate activists. But shipping and aviation emissions are now firmly on the agenda.

EU countries might not agree on how to reduce emissions in shipping, but they have edged closer to a consensus that it needs to happen — soon. The EU is demanding action to cut maritime emissions by 2023; if not by the International Maritime Organization, then by the EU itself, putting it on the map for the next Commission.

In aviation, the Netherlands was long alone in its push for an EU-wide tax on flying — whether through a tax on airline tickets, flights or jet fuel. Rather than wait for the rest of the bloc, the country went ahead and forged plans for a €7 levy on every passenger. The Dutch said they'd drop the tax if other EU countries agreed to a bloc-wide levy. That now looks more likely.

In pre-election interviews with POLITICO, only the European Conservatives and Reformists opposed a tax on airplane fuel. But the EPP’s Manfred Weber, the S&D’s Frans Timmermans and the Liberals’ Margrethe Vestager all backed the scheme. In a debate with Timmermans, Weber said “only a few right weirdos” would deny the need for a climate policy.

3. Carbon taxes: Whether a carbon tax at Europe’s border, as proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, or a tax on dirty energy imports, as floated by Spain, or an aviation tax as advocated by the Dutch, everybody is talking about green taxes as an essential tool to slash emissions by generating a shift to renewable energy, sustainable transport and changing consumption patterns.

The outgoing Commission agrees. “The element that we are missing in our toolbox is a modern framework for energy taxation that corresponds to our level of ambition,” Energy and Climate Action Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete said in April.

But EU countries would need to give their unanimous consensus for such a tax — something the Commission is trying to change, but it will face an uphill struggle. Yet there is growing political momentum on the issue. During the campaign, both Timmermans and Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent liberal voice, backed a carbon tax — not to speak of the Greens, who have long been calling for EU-wide green taxation.

""Why are we not taxing kerosene? We are taxing the fuel in cars and trains, but not airplanes. Unacceptable,"" Timmermans said during a candidates' debate.

“The big battle will be what to do with transport and agriculture under the pressure of the climate crisis” — Benedek Jávor, departing Green lawmaker

4. Sustainable finance: Europe needs €180 billion a year in investments over the next decade to deliver on its Paris Agreement climate goals. To get that sort of cash, Brussels is seeking to shift the financial sector to more sustainable investments.

“I could well imagine sustainable finance being among the new Commission's priorities,"" said Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis back in March.

The first step will be interinstitutional negotiations on the so-called taxonomy, or definition of what counts as sustainable investment in the EU, which a new, greener Parliament could seek to strengthen. The Commission’s financial policy department is already at work on the next sustainable legislative options for the new Commission.

5. Greening agriculture: The surge of Green MEPs in the European Parliament could spur wholesale change in the EU’s reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.

Some Greens would like the Parliament’s environmental committee to share oversight over the CAP, along with the agricultural committee. Green Party officials say they want positions chairing committees that legislate reforms in farming.

”In general, climate change will become a more important issue,” said Benedek Jávor, a departing Green lawmaker from Hungary. “The big battle will be what to do with transport and agriculture under the pressure of the climate crisis.”

Jávor said that the push to cap big payments, implement strict eco-schemes and redistribute payments to smaller farmers would increase in the next Parliament.

6. Climate and trade: The strong showing by parties with strong environmental agendas in core EU countries means MEPs will demand a trade policy that factors in more safeguards on labor rights and the environment.

Only a day after the European election, French Trade Minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said that a deal with South America's Mercosur block would need safeguards against deforestation.

Until now, ""sustainable trade"" provisions in EU trade have so far come without enforcement. EU trade chief Cecilia Malmström even argued against enforcing such provisions, saying partner countries would ask for concessions in exchange.

Another push for green trade will come from French President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance list. These new MEPs share many of the Greens’ ambitions on making sustainable trade chapters enforceable and taking environmental aspects of trade fully into account. Leading the list is French ecologist Pascal Canfin, a former Green politician who could lead the shift toward greener trade.

“Bayer and Monsanto, here we come again” — Aide to Socialist MEP Eric Andrieu following his reelection

In the Council, France and Spain are making clear they want the EU to bring its trade policy in line with its wider climate objectives. Macron’s idea of a carbon tax at Europe’s borders is also sure to attract much more attention in the coming months.

7. Pesticide clampdown: A greener European Parliament will mean greater pressure to reduce the use of pesticides across Europe — and louder protests from farmers and the chemicals industry that no real alternatives exist.

The license for glyphosate, the controversial and widely used herbicide, expires in December 2022 but the fight over whether it should be renewed will begin long before.

Key to that debate will be Socialist MEP Eric Andrieu, who chaired the pesticides committee in the last Parliament and has already stated his firm intention to battle agrichemical giant Bayer in the next five years. “Bayer and Monsanto, here we come again,” said one of Andrieu’s aides shortly after he was reelected.

If the Commission decides to tinker with the EU’s pesticides legislation, Greens will almost certainly launch a flurry of their own proposals.

482,Europe’s populists can’t be defeated — but they can be contained,Maciej Kisilowski,"The European election confronts us with a somber reality: Right-wing populism is now a major force in Europe — and it is here to stay.

Forget the doomsday predictions about the end of the Continent’s liberal order, or dreams of a miraculous return of the “end of history.” Those are as overblown as they are prevalent.

The liberal order can be protected from populism — using a strategy that’s already proved successful against a powerful ideological threat. Right-wing populism can’t be rolled back, but it can be contained.

After World War II, Western democracies squared off against communism with the strategy of containment. There’s no reason they can’t do the same again with right-wing nationalism. That will mean forgoing futile feel-good attempts to roll back populist advances, in exchange for an approach that keeps up the pressure until the opponents of the liberal order collapse under their own contradictions.

The logic of containment, first outlined in the famous 1946 cable by U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan, runs counter to the instincts of many of populism’s fiercest opponents. Countless commentators have criticized the European Union for its inability to bring Polish, Hungarian and Italian nationalists to heel. In some quarters, especially in France, some have called for politicians to aggressively punish the United Kingdom for its populist-inspired vote to leave the EU.

In practice, we should waste no opportunity to up the cost of illiberal politics, but we need to do so selectively and proportionally.

In both cases, however, EU leaders are wise not to pick fights they can’t win. Just as Kennan’s containment doctrine pushed back against those attempting to needlessly escalate the fight with the Soviet Union, it also points to a more realistic way forward today.

Containment is about separating our assessment of the political reality from the outcome we morally desire. Today, the facts speak for themselves: Populists have seized more than a quarter of seats in the European Parliament and run governments representing more than a quarter of the (post-Brexit) EU population.

Support for populists is also far from fleeting. Hungary has had an illiberal government for almost a decade now. In France, Marine Le Pen’s nationalists, who came out ahead of the beleaguered French President Emmanuel Macron’s liberals, have posed a serious threat since the 2002 presidential election. Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which took power in 2015, trounced the opposition this weekend, with over 40 percent of the vote. And, one year into its government, Italy’s League is successfully eating up the support of the relatively more moderate 5Star movement and shows no signs of slowing down.

That’s another parallel to the containment effort against communism. Just as post-World War II Europe had to contend with the existence of a robust alternative to liberal democracy, Europe’s liberal leaders today need to understand that the illiberal right will remain a major political force for the foreseeable future. Practically speaking, mainstream pro-European parties will sometimes have to work with the populists in order to achieve consensus on key issues such as the new EU budget and the Union’s negotiating position in Brexit talks.

What this does not mean is that they have to agree with populist leaders on a moral level or accept them as “normal.” On the contrary: The Cold War doctrine of containment diverged greatly from the type of appeasement proposed by those who wanted to accept communism as just “another way of life.” We must be similarly firm in refusing to compromise the moral superiority of equality over bigotry and of democracy and the rule of law over authoritarianism.

In practice, we should waste no opportunity to up the cost of illiberal politics, but we need to do so selectively and proportionally. The EU’s decision to open Article 7 proceedings against Poland and Hungary for breaches in the rule of law set a positive example. To be sure, the Commission may not have the votes in the European Council to enforce sanctions against either government. But that does not render these measures meaningless. The proceedings have sent a clear signal to Hungarian and Polish societies and weakened the legitimacy of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński.

In time, irrational political projects collapse under their own weight. In the case of communism, it took decades of patient and carefully calibrated actions for that prediction to materialize.

There are signs that the paradoxes inherent in right-wing populism are even more startling than those of Soviet communism. You cannot “keep migrants out” and pay for the growing number of pensioners. As a mid-sized nation-state, you cannot both “take back control” and strengthen your position in the global economy. You cannot make government more accountable to “the people” at the same time as you destroy independent institutions. And you cannot build an innovative economy while stifling critical thinking.

Brexit is perhaps the best example of how those contradictions play out, and how quickly that can happen. Less than three years after the triumphant jubilation of populists and xenophobes following the 2016 British referendum, last week we all witnessed the utter, teary humiliation of a prime minister forced to admit she had failed to find a viable solution for taking Britain out of the EU.

Europe’s democrats needn’t panic. Instead, they should focus on supporting good governance in the majority of EU countries they still control.

There are signs of weakness elsewhere as well. Austria’s Freedom Party is going through yet another collapse of its leadership. Poland’s PiS is under attack on a number of fronts, including its close relationship with a Catholic Church mired in scandals, its ham-handed educational reforms and loose fiscal policy. In Italy, while the far-right League party continues to gain support, its coalition partner the 5Star Movement is faltering in places where it scored its first victories, most notably in the city government of Rome.

Carl von Clausewitz, the Prussian strategy guru, rightly observed that a defensive posture offers important advantages. Europe’s democrats needn’t panic. Instead, they should focus on supporting good governance in the majority of EU countries they still control. Showcasing positive examples of how the liberal state can deal with the challenges of globalization is worth far more than any amount of moral outrage.

To be sure, the Commission may not have the votes in the European Council to enforce sanctions against either government. But that does not render these measures meaningless. The proceedings have sent a clear signal to Hungarian and Polish societies and weakened the legitimacy of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński.

In time, irrational political projects collapse under their own weight. In the case of communism, it took decades of patient and carefully calibrated actions for that prediction to materialize.

There are signs that the paradoxes inherent in right-wing populism are even more startling than those of Soviet communism. You cannot “keep migrants out” and pay for the growing number of pensioners. As a mid-sized nation-state, you cannot both “take back control” and strengthen your position in the global economy. You cannot make government more accountable to “the people” at the same time as you destroy independent institutions. And you cannot build an innovative economy while stifling critical thinking.

Brexit is perhaps the best example of how those contradictions play out, and how quickly that can happen. Less than three years after the triumphant jubilation of populists and xenophobes following the 2016 British referendum, last week we all witnessed the utter, teary humiliation of a prime minister forced to admit she had failed to find a viable solution for taking Britain out of the EU.

Europe’s democrats needn’t panic. Instead, they should focus on supporting good governance in the majority of EU countries they still control.

There are signs of weakness elsewhere as well. Austria’s Freedom Party is going through yet another collapse of its leadership. Poland’s PiS is under attack on a number of fronts, including its close relationship with a Catholic Church mired in scandals, its ham-handed educational reforms and loose fiscal policy. In Italy, while the far-right League party continues to gain support, its coalition partner the 5Star Movement is faltering in places where it scored its first victories, most notably in the city government of Rome.

Carl von Clausewitz, the Prussian strategy guru, rightly observed that a defensive posture offers important advantages. Europe’s democrats needn’t panic. Instead, they should focus on supporting good governance in the majority of EU countries they still control. Showcasing positive examples of how the liberal state can deal with the challenges of globalization is worth far more than any amount of moral outrage.

487,Europe’s populists can’t be defeated — but they can be contained,Matthew Karnitschnig,"The European election confronts us with a somber reality: Right-wing populism is now a major force in Europe — and it is here to stay.

Forget the doomsday predictions about the end of the Continent’s liberal order, or dreams of a miraculous return of the “end of history.” Those are as overblown as they are prevalent.

The liberal order can be protected from populism — using a strategy that’s already proved successful against a powerful ideological threat. Right-wing populism can’t be rolled back, but it can be contained.

After World War II, Western democracies squared off against communism with the strategy of containment. There’s no reason they can’t do the same again with right-wing nationalism. That will mean forgoing futile feel-good attempts to roll back populist advances, in exchange for an approach that keeps up the pressure until the opponents of the liberal order collapse under their own contradictions.

The logic of containment, first outlined in the famous 1946 cable by U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan, runs counter to the instincts of many of populism’s fiercest opponents. Countless commentators have criticized the European Union for its inability to bring Polish, Hungarian and Italian nationalists to heel. In some quarters, especially in France, some have called for politicians to aggressively punish the United Kingdom for its populist-inspired vote to leave the EU.

In practice, we should waste no opportunity to up the cost of illiberal politics, but we need to do so selectively and proportionally.

In both cases, however, EU leaders are wise not to pick fights they can’t win. Just as Kennan’s containment doctrine pushed back against those attempting to needlessly escalate the fight with the Soviet Union, it also points to a more realistic way forward today.

Containment is about separating our assessment of the political reality from the outcome we morally desire. Today, the facts speak for themselves: Populists have seized more than a quarter of seats in the European Parliament and run governments representing more than a quarter of the (post-Brexit) EU population.

Support for populists is also far from fleeting. Hungary has had an illiberal government for almost a decade now. In France, Marine Le Pen’s nationalists, who came out ahead of the beleaguered French President Emmanuel Macron’s liberals, have posed a serious threat since the 2002 presidential election. Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which took power in 2015, trounced the opposition this weekend, with over 40 percent of the vote. And, one year into its government, Italy’s League is successfully eating up the support of the relatively more moderate 5Star movement and shows no signs of slowing down.

That’s another parallel to the containment effort against communism. Just as post-World War II Europe had to contend with the existence of a robust alternative to liberal democracy, Europe’s liberal leaders today need to understand that the illiberal right will remain a major political force for the foreseeable future. Practically speaking, mainstream pro-European parties will sometimes have to work with the populists in order to achieve consensus on key issues such as the new EU budget and the Union’s negotiating position in Brexit talks.

What this does not mean is that they have to agree with populist leaders on a moral level or accept them as “normal.” On the contrary: The Cold War doctrine of containment diverged greatly from the type of appeasement proposed by those who wanted to accept communism as just “another way of life.” We must be similarly firm in refusing to compromise the moral superiority of equality over bigotry and of democracy and the rule of law over authoritarianism.

In practice, we should waste no opportunity to up the cost of illiberal politics, but we need to do so selectively and proportionally. The EU’s decision to open Article 7 proceedings against Poland and Hungary for breaches in the rule of law set a positive example. To be sure, the Commission may not have the votes in the European Council to enforce sanctions against either government. But that does not render these measures meaningless. The proceedings have sent a clear signal to Hungarian and Polish societies and weakened the legitimacy of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński.

490,Trump’s fake fight against real news,Jack Shafer,"U.S. President Donald Trump | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Fourth Estate Trump’s fake fight against real news The White House is losing its public relations battle with journalists.

U.S. President Donald Trump must spend hours and hours of his executive time thinking up new ways to tease and taunt the press.

He has stirred hatred for reporters by calling them the “enemy of the people” and describing their accounts as “fake news.” He has singled out individual reporters — Jim Acosta, Peter Alexander, April Ryan, Abby Phillip, Yamiche Alcindor, and others — for direct, vocal abuse. He has threatened the New York Times with a libel suit. He continues to employ a mendacious press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has reduced the frequency of official press briefings from daily to less than monthly. (She hasn’t held one in 58 days, a modern White House record.) And most notably last November, his administration yanked CNN reporter Acosta’s White House press pass.

The White House returned Acosta’s pass after he sued, but the president continues to prospect new frontiers in press hazing. On Wednesday, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank reported that the White House had revoked his “hard pass,” the credential that makes it simpler for journalists to access the grounds to report on the administration. Milbank had held a hard pass for 21 years.

I won’t say Trump’s micro-aggressions against the press are harmless, but they’re hardly the savaging of the First Amendment or the defenestration of the White House press corps some (not Milbank) would make them out to be. That Trump continues to toss pebbles rather than heaving cannonballs is a better indicator that the president is losing his campaign with the press than winning. A harassment campaign like this one is vintage Trump, like a slap-fight in a bar, something that gives the illusion that he’s a tough guy when he’s closer to a pushover.

To trust Sanders — and I don’t — Milbank isn’t being punished for anything he wrote. He’s a victim of a new set of rules, promulgated in March. Journalists can qualify for renewal of their hard passes if they visit the White House, on average, every other day in the half-year since their last renewal, the Post’s Paul Farhi reported. Sanders told Farhi that the new hard pass rules were designed to improve White House security, not to punish the press. In addition to Milbank, seven Post White House reporters lost their hard passes under the new requirements, but unlike Milbank they qualified for “exemptions” and had them reinstated.

Why pick on Milbank? “I strongly suspect it’s because I’m a Trump critic,” he wrote in his column. “The move is perfectly in line with Trump’s banning of certain news organizations, including the Post, from his campaign events and his threats to revoke White House credentials of journalists he doesn’t like.”

The White House’s new attendance-based rules are a farce no matter how you look at them. If applied consistently, Sanders, who rarely meets the press for official briefings, should have to give up her White House credentials, too! Nor is security an issue, as Sanders alleges in a conversation with Farhi. The Secret Service completes a security check — including an FBI background investigation — for all hard pass applicants. Milbank, who has cleared these bars, poses no security threat to Trump unless routinely fracturing the president’s fragile ego in his column can be considered a threat.

The administration’s cheap-jack tactics won’t exclude Milbank or other reporters from the White House. As Farhi notes, the hard pass is good for two years, but reporters who don’t hold hard passes can still apply for daily, weekly, or six-month passes for White House visits. The new rules merely inconvenience the White House reporters by forcing them to keep attendance records and to jump through the administration’s bureaucratic hoops if they miss too many days. The rules, writes Milbank, leave many in the White House press corps credentialed under “exceptions,” which means they’re serving “at the pleasure of press secretary Sarah Sanders.”

What’s next on the Trump administration’s agenda, Sanders taking daily attendance for the White House press corps? Truancy notes to editors? As many have noted, it’s not as if the president dislikes the press. He loves to take reporters’ questions on the White House lawn, or as they shout them out as he boards Marine One, or when a foreign dignitary comes to visit, or when he turns a White House event into a wild, impromptu news conference as he did Thursday afternoon. He lives to talk to supplicants on “Fox & Friends” or the Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity shows. As long he controls the terms of engagement and can stop tough queries in a decent interval, the president blooms with delight.

It’s hard to interpret the new hard pass rules as anything but Trump’s payback for his face-losing loss in the Acosta contretemps. He lost so badly in that round that White House carpenters had to build a special weeping room in the residential quarter for him to decant his tear ducts. These new rules — unlike his arbitrary and capricious treatment of Acosta — seem safe from being challenged or overturned. As acts of retaliation go, it’s minor, but it must have brought great cheer to the president, who loves to stick it in and break it off. I’ll bet he inhaled Milbank’s column like it was two scoops of ice cream nestled on a slice of chocolate cream pie.

The new rules put the Trump offense back on the field and presage at least two more years of similar tiny insults and inconveniences for the White House press corps. Think of him as the 11-year-old sociopath who, after getting bitten by ants, saw no recourse but to kick the anthill. Unless that 11-year-old wants to resort to napalm, it’s a fight he’ll never win.

496,European election’s winners and losers,Ryan Heath,"This European election was not a contest with an overarching continental narrative, but a series of national and regional battles.

For the two main party groupings in the European Parliament (each losing seats and with less than a quarter of the vote), there will be relief that the results were not worse than they turned out. Here's POLITICO's guide to the biggest winners and losers:

Turnout

Voter turnout rose dramatically, making the voting process the biggest winner, after 40 years of declining participation. Champagne corks will be popping in Brussels if national election authorities confirm Monday that the magic 50 percent turnout figure was reached (currently it is projected to hit 50.95 percent).

The main parties

The center-right European People’s Party fell below 25 percent of the vote for the first time since 1989, and the Socialists are hovering at about 20 percent. That's their worst performance since European Parliament direct elections began in 1979.

The bright spots for the big parties came in Italy, where the Democratic Party pushed past the 5Star Movement to take second place and 19 seats. In Spain too, the Socialist party won a clear victory and grew to 18 seats. In Greece, the EPP-aligned New Democracy will win nine seats. By convincingly beating the far-left governing party Syriza, it has prompted Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call a national election in June.

Salvini's crew

Of the parties that grew, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s alliance is doing best — essentially doubling in size to 70-75 seats, but getting nowhere close to dominance in Parliament. His League colleagues will be lucky to lead the fourth-biggest group in Parliament. The liberal ALDE alliance also gained about 35 seats, thanks mostly to Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche movement, to hit 100-105 seats and take a clear third place.

Green wave

The EU's ""Green wave"" is both real and geographically limited. Green parties finished second and third in countries including Germany, France, Finland and Luxembourg. Yet Green parties have won no seats in Southern and Eastern Europe. They won only two seats in Central Europe, from Austria, itself a decline on the 2014 Austrian result. Even so, a surge in support for the Greens in the U.K. means the group is likely to beat Salvini's alliance.

Euroskeptic march

Euroskeptic parties had their best showing in Hungary where Viktor Orbán's ruling Fidesz party scored 53 percent, enough for 13 seats. Euroskeptics won 62 percent overall there. Fidesz will now need to decide whether to moderate and stay within the EPP, or to branch out and join a Euroskeptic party group. The outcome may affect the EPP’s bargaining power for top jobs like European Commission president. In Poland, Euroskeptics captured 53 percent of the vote. And across the Parliament, Euroskeptic parties look set to end the night with 235 seats.

Leave and Remain

In the U.K., Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, which wants the country to get out of the EU with or without a deal, took first place nationally, raking in close to a third of the votes cast. But that win was counterbalanced by strong surges for unequivocally pro-Remain parties, most notably the Liberal Democrats, who look to be on course for second place with around a fifth of the vote.

Voter disapproval

Scandal-prone parties tended to pay a heavy price. The ruling Romanian Social Democratic Party lost more than one-third of their vote share, and seven of their 16 seats, punishment in part for playing fast and loose with rule of law in the country. Romanian expats lined up for hours to cast ballots against a party many said was a reason for leaving Romania.

Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) lost support after the so-called Ibiza scandal in which secretly recorded footage emerged showing Heinz-Christian Strache — then vice chancellor and FPÖ leader — attempting to trade public contracts for campaign support. The party came third with 17.2 percent, down 3 percentage points on the party's 2017 general election showing.

The Danish People’s Party, whose members were regularly caught up in investigations over misspending EU money in the last five years, lost more than half of their votes and two of their three seats. One of Salvini's key allies, Anders Primdahl Vistisen, lost his seat.

In Estonia, the far-right Conservative People’s Party hasn’t even made it through a month of government before being punished at the polls, beaten by even the tiny social democrats, and winning only one seat.

Narrow win

Marine Le Pen’s National Rally was the winner in France on vote share, but it was a hollow victory: Her party lost support compared to 2014. That’s despite coming second in the 2017 French presidential election and the golden opportunity presented by an electorate angry at President Macron’s policies and governing style.

Macron’s so-called Renaissance list suffered the humiliation of finishing second in France, but could still act as a kingmaker in coming months; either by dominating the Parliament’s Liberal bloc or forming a small new progressive front that acts as a balance of power in Council, Commission and Parliament votes.","This European election was not a contest with an overarching continental narrative, but a series of national and regional battles.

498,Populist tide rises but fails to flood EU,Matthew Karnitschnig,"BERLIN — Phew. Turns out the bark of Europe’s far right is worse than its bite.

Yes, illiberal parties did well in France and Italy, Poland, Hungary and beyond. But overall no better than expected, and in some cases worse so.

Bottom line: The populists’ finish isn’t that much stronger than in 2014.

That’s good news for Europe’s democratic parties and even better news for the European Union. The strategy of Europe’s centrists, from Merkel to Macron, to cast the election as a question of “Europe’s destiny” helped drive voters to polling stations.

Throughout the campaign, pro-EU parties warned that the scourge of Euroskeptic populism, in the guise of France’s National Rally, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Italy’s League and many others, threatens to undo decades of European integration.

Even in France and Italy, where the populists did the best on the Continent, the results are below some expectations.

Europeans heeded those calls and turned out to vote in large numbers, with voter participation across Europe at about 51 percent, compared to 43 percent in 2014.

The strong participation helped temper the results for the Euroskeptics, who tend to benefit from low turnout because they're good at getting their own voters to cast a ballot.

In Germany and Austria, the far-right populists finished below their results in national elections in 2017, down by 1.8 and 3.3 percentage points respectively.

Though the AfD was quick to note its result is up by more than 50 percent compared to the last European election in 2014 — from 7.1 to 10.8 percent — the comparison is problematic because the party has undergone a dramatic metamorphosis since then. Five years ago, the AfD was still focused on its opposition to eurozone bailouts; its hard-right lurch and focus on migration came only later.

The German-speaking far right’s reversal of fortune might have been influenced by the recent “Ibiza affair” in Austria, but there were signs of weakness elsewhere too.

The anti-immigration Danish People’s Party won only one seat in the European Parliament, compared to four last time out. In the Netherlands, far-right parties performed worse than many of their opponents feared. In Spain, the populist Vox party managed to win only about 6 percent of the vote. Estonia’s far-right EKRE party, which recently joined the country’s governing coalition, finished only third in Sunday’s European election.

Though Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party did well in the U.K., capturing first place, it’s unlikely to play much of a role in the next Parliament without membership in one of the main alliances, which seems unlikely.

Even in France and Italy, where the populists did best on the Continent, the results are below some expectations. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally recorded a strong 23.5 percent of the French vote, finishing first — but that is still slightly below the party’s 2014 result. Her rebranded party is on course to have two seats fewer in the European Parliament this time around.

Salvini's League party appears to have performed strongly in Italy, winning more than 33 percent of the vote. But his dreams of forming the biggest group in the European Parliament will remain just that. POLITICO's projections suggest his group will have around 70 seats in the 751-member chamber.

Salvini has been laying the groundwork for a new populist alliance that is expected to include the AfD, the National Rally, Austria’s Freedom Party and possibly Viktor Orban’s Fidesz, which may leave the center-right European People's Party soon.

With or without Orbán, there are big questions over just how cohesive the planned populist grouping will be. While the parties share a basic aversion to migration and an illiberal, anti-democratic ethos, they don’t have much else in common.

Salvini, for example, thumbs his nose at European rules regarding budgetary discipline, a position that’s anathema to the AfD and Austria’s Freedom Party. The Italian leader also wants other European countries to take in many of the refugees now stranded in Italy, something Orbán rejects outright.

While such divisions aren’t new, they illustrate the advantage the centrist parties — a group expected to control a majority of the new parliament’s seats — will have vis-à-vis the populists.

By definition, the populists pursue a nationalist agenda at odds with coalition-building at the European level. That means the mainstream parties don’t have to try to divide and conquer them. The populists will do it themselves.","Even in France and Italy, where the populists did the best on the Continent, the results are below some expectations.

500,Nigel Farage’s new Brexit revolution,Tom Mctague,"LONDON — The Tories cannot shake Nigel Farage.

Having all-but retired from politics after the EU referendum in 2016, the former UKIP leader-turned-Brexit Party frontman is back with a vengeance, more influential than ever before.

With a third of the vote, Farage’s Brexit Party comfortably topped the European poll in the U.K. Though the win builds on UKIP's victory over the established parties in 2014, it still marks a stunning result for a party that did not exist at the turn of the year. It has no MPs, no members and no policies other than taking Britain out of the European Union.

The Conservative Party was crushed, suffering its worst result in 200 years. Labour also emerged bloody and bruised, slipping into third place behind the avowedly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats.

Farage’s triumph is another significant moment for British politics and its seemingly never-ending soap opera over Brexit.

Farage was certainly keen to keep his foot on Tory throats Sunday night.

The result, in which parties seeking compromise Brexit positions were trashed in favor of those making clear pure Leave or Remain pitches, reveals the dramatically changing electoral calculus for both main political parties. And it further ramps up the pressure on both to confront the choice they have long sought to avoid: no-deal or no Brexit?

It sets up a winner-takes-all battle for control of an increasingly polarized country, cleaving along new fault lines created by the 2016 referendum.

That vote — remember — was supposed to “settle” the question of Britain’s EU membership once and for all. Instead, it has unleashed a political revolution that threatens to destroy both main parties or, at least, the electoral coalitions that sustained them for much of the post-war period.

Farage’s power lies not in his potential to sweep into Westminster — Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system makes that extremely hard — but in his ability to force the Conservatives and Labour to shed the last vestiges of Brexit ambiguity. The Brexit Party's success, and that of the Lib Dems (slogan: ""Bollocks to Brexit"") is reshaping British politics along the Remain vs. Leave fault line that both have desperately sought to avoid.

Farage was certainly keen to keep his foot on Tory throats Sunday night. “If we don’t leave on October 31st then the scores you’ve seen today for the Brexit Party will be repeated in a general election,” he said.

And Tories appeared to get the message Monday morning. Brexit Minister James Cleverly tweeted: ""We need to deliver Brexit in order to be believed and listened to.""

Health Secretary Matt Hancock, a candidate to succeed May, echoed that analysis. ""Deliver Brexit, not defined by Brexit,"" he wrote in the Times.

Brexit gale

A note of caution. Farage’s UKIP topped the polls in the 2014 European elections, but failed to win a single seat a year later in the 2015 general election. His party was then all-but destroyed in Theresa May's ill-fated snap election in 2017.

A European election is not a British general election, where bread-and-butter issues of health, education and state spending usually dominate.

Yet, the seemingly unstoppable Brexit gale is gusting through British politics, uprooting previously solid assumptions in a way few in Westminster are comfortable with.

Those close to Theresa May believe that in an all-or-nothing contest — no deal or no Brexit — the failure to strike a compromise deal will only prolong the political crisis. May herself was arguing Monday that the result showed the need for compromise: ""It shows the importance of finding a Brexit deal, and I sincerely hope these results focus minds in Parliament,"" she tweeted.

Attempts to force a no deal on the U.K.'s Brexit deadline of October 31, which a majority in the House of Commons oppose, could precipitate a general election if enough Tory MPs vote against their government in a confidence motion.

What is certain from the European election results is that Britain remains as divided by Brexit as ever.

That could pave the way for a no-deal crash out of the EU and the remaking of the British economy, risking a second independence referendum in Scotland and moves toward Irish unification. Equally, it could also propel Labour's Jeremy Corbyn to power and increase the likelihood of a second referendum, which may only prolong the crisis further.

For the Conservative Party, having swelled its support base in 2017 on a promise to deliver Brexit, failure to do now looks potentially fatal — the final act of a party unable to stay above water in the tide of events set off by the 2016 vote.

May’s resignation Friday now seems all but certain to propel a no-deal Tory leader into power. That will force moderate Tory MPs who are opposed to no-deal into a tricky position.

“The Tory party embracing no deal in the hope that it saves its political fortunes will backfire,"" said one Tory MPs. ""The electorate will see through it and rightly blame the Tories for everything that goes wrong.”

Yet, with the Brexit Party now outpolling the Conservative Party in even some national polls, the pressure to pursue a no-deal Brexit may prove impossible for any Tory leader to ignore.

Of the leadership contenders jockeying for position, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, former Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey have all indicated they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Of those who backed Remain in 2016, Hancock and the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt have also echoed the “no deal is better than a bad deal” mantra.

In the current climate, however, even Johnson may prove too “soft” on Brexit to stave off Farage’s new movement. In his regular Telegraph column Monday, Johnson declares: ""No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table.""

But having voted for May’s deal on the final time of asking on March 29, Farage has branded him untrustworthy.

Pressure on Corbyn

Equally, for Labour, the structural weakness of the political scaffolding it built to shore up its electoral coalition by committing to Brexit but pushing for the softest possible version, has been exposed.

Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, was speaking for many in the party when on election night she attacked the leadership's attempt at Brexit triangulation.

“We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,” she said. “We should have said, quite simply, that any deal that comes out of this government should be put to a confirmatory referendum, and that Remain should be on the ballot paper, and that Labour would campaign to Remain.”

Corbyn attempted to inch his position along this road Sunday. ""This issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote,” he said. By the morning, the line had evolved slightly further. ""I think we do have a responsibility to listen to what everyone has to say and ensure that there is an agreement made and that is then put to a public vote,"" he told Sky News Monday.

It remains to been if that is enough for activists and supporters who watched as they were beaten into third place by the Lib Dem surge.

What is certain from the European election results is that Britain remains as divided by Brexit as ever.

“It’s best read as approximating a draw,” the BBC’s polling expert John Curtice said, when asked if Leave or Remain had come out on top. “This election has demonstrated just how polarized the public are on this. We are a deeply divided country, and that’s one of the reasons this Brexit impasse is going to be very, very difficult to resolve.”

And with Brexit dragging on, Nigel Farage isn't going anywhere.","With a third of the vote, Farage’s Brexit Party comfortably topped the European poll in the U.K.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock, a candidate to succeed May, echoed that analysis. ""Deliver Brexit, not defined by Brexit,"" he wrote in the Times.

Brexit gale

A note of caution. Farage’s UKIP topped the polls in the 2014 European elections, but failed to win a single seat a year later in the 2015 general election. His party was then all-but destroyed in Theresa May's ill-fated snap election in 2017.

A European election is not a British general election, where bread-and-butter issues of health, education and state spending usually dominate.

Yet, the seemingly unstoppable Brexit gale is gusting through British politics, uprooting previously solid assumptions in a way few in Westminster are comfortable with.

Those close to Theresa May believe that in an all-or-nothing contest — no deal or no Brexit — the failure to strike a compromise deal will only prolong the political crisis. May herself was arguing Monday that the result showed the need for compromise: ""It shows the importance of finding a Brexit deal, and I sincerely hope these results focus minds in Parliament,"" she tweeted.

Attempts to force a no deal on the U.K.'s Brexit deadline of October 31, which a majority in the House of Commons oppose, could precipitate a general election if enough Tory MPs vote against their government in a confidence motion.

What is certain from the European election results is that Britain remains as divided by Brexit as ever.

That could pave the way for a no-deal crash out of the EU and the remaking of the British economy, risking a second independence referendum in Scotland and moves toward Irish unification. Equally, it could also propel Labour's Jeremy Corbyn to power and increase the likelihood of a second referendum, which may only prolong the crisis further.

For the Conservative Party, having swelled its support base in 2017 on a promise to deliver Brexit, failure to do now looks potentially fatal — the final act of a party unable to stay above water in the tide of events set off by the 2016 vote.

May’s resignation Friday now seems all but certain to propel a no-deal Tory leader into power. That will force moderate Tory MPs who are opposed to no-deal into a tricky position.

“The Tory party embracing no deal in the hope that it saves its political fortunes will backfire,"" said one Tory MPs. ""The electorate will see through it and rightly blame the Tories for everything that goes wrong.”

Yet, with the Brexit Party now outpolling the Conservative Party in even some national polls, the pressure to pursue a no-deal Brexit may prove impossible for any Tory leader to ignore.

Of the leadership contenders jockeying for position, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, former Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey have all indicated they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Of those who backed Remain in 2016, Hancock and the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt have also echoed the “no deal is better than a bad deal” mantra.

In the current climate, however, even Johnson may prove too “soft” on Brexit to stave off Farage’s new movement. In his regular Telegraph column Monday, Johnson declares: ""No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table.""

But having voted for May’s deal on the final time of asking on March 29, Farage has branded him untrustworthy.

Pressure on Corbyn

Equally, for Labour, the structural weakness of the political scaffolding it built to shore up its electoral coalition by committing to Brexit but pushing for the softest possible version, has been exposed.

Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, was speaking for many in the party when on election night she attacked the leadership's attempt at Brexit triangulation.

“We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,” she said. “We should have said, quite simply, that any deal that comes out of this government should be put to a confirmatory referendum, and that Remain should be on the ballot paper, and that Labour would campaign to Remain.”

Corbyn attempted to inch his position along this road Sunday. ""This issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote,” he said. By the morning, the line had evolved slightly further. ""I think we do have a responsibility to listen to what everyone has to say and ensure that there is an agreement made and that is then put to a public vote,"" he told Sky News Monday.

It remains to been if that is enough for activists and supporters who watched as they were beaten into third place by the Lib Dem surge.

What is certain from the European election results is that Britain remains as divided by Brexit as ever.

“It’s best read as approximating a draw,” the BBC’s polling expert John Curtice said, when asked if Leave or Remain had come out on top. “This election has demonstrated just how polarized the public are on this. We are a deeply divided country, and that’s one of the reasons this Brexit impasse is going to be very, very difficult to resolve.”

502,Nigel Farage’s new Brexit revolution,Charlie Cooper,"LONDON — The Tories cannot shake Nigel Farage.

Having all-but retired from politics after the EU referendum in 2016, the former UKIP leader-turned-Brexit Party frontman is back with a vengeance, more influential than ever before.

With a third of the vote, Farage’s Brexit Party comfortably topped the European poll in the U.K. Though the win builds on UKIP's victory over the established parties in 2014, it still marks a stunning result for a party that did not exist at the turn of the year. It has no MPs, no members and no policies other than taking Britain out of the European Union.

The Conservative Party was crushed, suffering its worst result in 200 years. Labour also emerged bloody and bruised, slipping into third place behind the avowedly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats.

Farage’s triumph is another significant moment for British politics and its seemingly never-ending soap opera over Brexit.

Farage was certainly keen to keep his foot on Tory throats Sunday night.

The result, in which parties seeking compromise Brexit positions were trashed in favor of those making clear pure Leave or Remain pitches, reveals the dramatically changing electoral calculus for both main political parties. And it further ramps up the pressure on both to confront the choice they have long sought to avoid: no-deal or no Brexit?

It sets up a winner-takes-all battle for control of an increasingly polarized country, cleaving along new fault lines created by the 2016 referendum.

That vote — remember — was supposed to “settle” the question of Britain’s EU membership once and for all. Instead, it has unleashed a political revolution that threatens to destroy both main parties or, at least, the electoral coalitions that sustained them for much of the post-war period.

Farage’s power lies not in his potential to sweep into Westminster — Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system makes that extremely hard — but in his ability to force the Conservatives and Labour to shed the last vestiges of Brexit ambiguity. The Brexit Party's success, and that of the Lib Dems (slogan: ""Bollocks to Brexit"") is reshaping British politics along the Remain vs. Leave fault line that both have desperately sought to avoid.

Farage was certainly keen to keep his foot on Tory throats Sunday night. “If we don’t leave on October 31st then the scores you’ve seen today for the Brexit Party will be repeated in a general election,” he said.

503,The euthanasia that wasn’t,Naomi O'Leary,"It was a story too horrible to be true: A 17-year-old victim of sexual assault had been euthanized in the Netherlands.

And indeed, it wasn’t true. Noa Pothoven, a sufferer of anorexia and other mental illnesses, had previously sought euthanasia at a clinic without telling her parents — but she had been refused.

The teenager died at the weekend, several days after she began to refuse all fluids and foods. Her parents and doctors agreed not to force feed her or compel her into treatment against her will.

Was it euthanasia?

“No no no no, you can't speak of active euthanization,” said Paul Bolwerk, a journalist at local newspaper the Gelderlander who has followed Pothoven’s struggles with mental illness and spoken with her parents about their battles to find an effective treatment.

In the months since Pothoven’s visit to the euthanasia clinic, the increasingly desperate family sought to secure electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment, but this was not authorized for a minor, Bolwerk told POLITICO.

Dutch media did not report that Pothoven died of euthanasia. But the English-language reporting of the story did

“During the last months she had undertaken several attempts to commit suicide,” he said.

“She got depressed more and more, and said, ‘Well, OK, now I press on the button. Now I say I will stop with all treatments.’ And that was very stressful for everyone, including the parents, the doctors, the psychiatrists,” he added. “So she stayed at home and decided not to eat and drink, and it was very hard to accept that for everyone.”

Pothoven had been repeatedly hospitalized for her mental illnesses, which she blamed on experiences of sexual assault recounted in her award-winning book “Winning or Learning.”

On Sunday, the Gelderlander reported she had died in a hospital bed set up in the living room of her family’s home in Arnhem.

A lie that traveled around the world

Days before, she had published a post to the 10,000 followers of her Instagram account, announcing she would die.

“A sad last post,” Pothoven wrote in the post, which has since been made private.

“I’ll get straight to the point: within a maximum of 10 days I will die. After years of fighting and struggling it is over. I have stopped eating and drinking for a while now, and after many conversations and reviews it has been decided that I will be let go because my suffering is unbearable. It is finished. For so long I have not really been living, I have been surviving, and even that not really. I have not really been alive for so long, I am surviving, and even that not really. I breathe but I am no longer alive.”

Some stories explicitly made the false claim that Pothoven was given euthanasia by a clinic, leaping ahead of the facts based on her prior request for euthanasia and her Instagram post

Dutch media did not report that Pothoven died of euthanasia. But the English-language reporting of the story did, even as they cited Dutch news reports that did not speak of euthanasia.

The simple falsehood spread around the world at lightning speed, as news organizations copied and republished the story without stopping to check the facts.

Some stories explicitly made the false claim that Pothoven was given euthanasia by a clinic, leaping ahead of the facts based on her prior request for euthanasia and her Instagram post.

The headline on the website of the Daily Mail, one of the most popular English-language sites in the world, read “Dutch girl, 17, who was sexually abused at 11 and raped as a 14-year-old is legally euthanized at her home by ‘end-of-life’ clinic.”

A report by Euronews read: “Originally the clinic said she was too young … But legally minors are eligible under certain circumstances. Pothoven wrote on Instagram last week that after many 'conversations and reviews' it had been decided.”

The truth is clear: Pothoven sought euthanasia, and she was refused

The deeply shocking story on such a controversial issue was irresistible, and became a top news item all over the world overnight. Pothoven’s name was soon trending on Twitter in Italy. News reports repeating the false claims were published from Australia to India to the United States. The story featured on Wednesday's edition of Britain’s top current affairs radio program, BBC Radio 4’s Today.

What is euthanasia?

Some might argue that while the cause of Pothoven’s death does not meet the technical definition of euthanasia, her family’s decision not to intervene might meet some people’s interpretation of the word.

This is a deeply contentious area of medicine and ethics, and norms differ around the world, but the answer is no.

The common understanding of euthanasia is that it involves deliberately giving a patient drugs that will end their life.

In the Netherlands, euthanasia is explicitly defined as an active intervention to cause death. According to the Royal Dutch Medical Association, “Euthanasia is defined as the active termination of life at a patient’s voluntary and well-informed request.” There are strict legal limits on when it can be performed.

Situations such as sedating the terminally ill as they approach the end of their life, or deciding on balance that it is not in the patient’s interest to receive further treatment, can be contentious, but are not normally considered euthanasia.

Health services around the world have different guidelines on how patients and doctors can decide whether to continue treatment, and when it might be appropriate to, for example, withdraw life support.

Such decision-making processes take into account factors such as the best interests of the patient, their capacity to make a decision, and the wishes of their family.

504,Trump to Ireland: Post-Brexit border ‘wall’ will work out well,James Randerson,"U.S. President Donald Trump holds a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport on June 5, 2019 in Shannon, Ireland | Pool/Getty Images Trump to Ireland: Post-Brexit border ‘wall’ will work out well US president says Brexit ‘should be good’ for Ireland.

Donald Trump wished Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar well with his country's border ""wall"" after Brexit, ahead of a one-to-one meeting between the two leaders.

The U.S. president flew to Ireland from a D-Day commemoration ceremony in Portsmouth on the south coast of England Wednesday — the culmination of his state visit to the U.K.

During a brief exchange before his meeting with Varadkar at Shannon Airport, near Ireland's west coast, Trump said to Varadkar: ""Probably you'll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very involved with Brexit.""

""I think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,"" Trump added before drawing parallels with the U.S. southern border with Mexico. ""We have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it's going to work out very well here.""

Varadkar replied, ""I think one thing we want to avoid, of course, is a wall or border between us.""

The Irish border has proved a major sticking point in finding a resolution to Brexit. The backstop solution contained in the Withdrawal Agreement signed off by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's government in November was rejected by MPs three times.

""I know that's a big point of contention with respect to Brexit,"" said Trump. ""I'm sure it's going to work out very well. I know they're focused very heavily on it.""

In response to a question about whether Brexit would be bad for Ireland, Trump said, ""I think it should be good.""

At the Portsmouth event, Trump and 15 other world leaders — including May, Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron — signed a proclamation marking the sacrifice of those killed and injured and pledging to promote shared values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law.

""We commit to work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully,"" the proclamation reads.","U.S. President Donald Trump holds a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport on June 5, 2019 in Shannon, Ireland | Pool/Getty Images Trump to Ireland: Post-Brexit border ‘wall’ will work out well US president says Brexit ‘should be good’ for Ireland.
