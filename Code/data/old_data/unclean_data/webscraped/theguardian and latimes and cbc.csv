0,Inquiry into oil tanker attacks stops short of blaming Iran,Patrick Wintour,"An unidentified state actor has been blamed for attacks on four oil tankers in the Gulf last month, according to an inconclusive inquiry that stopped short of explicitly pointing the finger at Iran.

The UAE along with Saudi Arabia and Norway presented the preliminary findings during a private briefing to members of the UN security council, which will also receive the final results of the inquiry and consider a possible response.

The US has accused Iran of almost certainly being behind the attacks on the four oil tankers off the Emirati coast, but the brief report, while providing evidence of the sophistication of the attack, goes nowhere near identifying the culprit.

The UAE may be waiting on whether other intelligence agencies can provide evidence that Iran directed surrogate groups, or possibly Houthi rebels, to carry out the attack.

The four vessels – two Saudi-flagged, a Norwegian-flagged and an Emirati-flagged – were damaged by explosions in UAE territorial waters, off the port of Fujairah.

The UAE is convinced Iran was behind the attacks and that they were designed to send a clear message to the US and the Gulf States about its capacity to wreak havoc on oil shipping, including through the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran is battling the effects of US sanctions, including on its ability to export oil, the lifeblood of its economy.

The initial findings showed that it was “highly likely” that four limpet mines, which are magnetically attached to a ship’s hull under the waterline, were used in the attacks. The report said they had been placed by trained divers deployed from fast boats. The mines were placed soon after the ships were anchored.

The UAE believes the attacks required high-level intelligence in order to identify the four oil tankers as targets, one of which – a Saudi ship – was at the opposite end of the anchorage area at Fujairah from the three other tankers.

The report also said that detailed knowledge of the ships’ designs was required to detonate the mines without sinking the tankers. The mines were sequenced to explode within an hour of each other.

Despite the ambiguous findings, Saudi Arabia continued to blame its arch-enemy, Iran. Tehran has denied involvement.

“We believe the responsibility for this attack lies on the shoulders of Iran,” Saudi Arabia’s UN ambassador, Abdallah al-Mouallimi, said after the briefing.

Saudi Arabia maintains that the attacks affect the safety of international navigation and the security of world oil supplies, requiring a response from the security council.

Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Vladimir Safronkov, said after the closed-door briefing that no evidence had been presented linking Iran to the attacks. “We shouldn’t jump to conclusions,” Safronkov said. “This investigation will be continued.”

Tehran reacted coolly to the findings, saying the UAE was determined to blame it as part of an effort to escalate the situation and press the US into a war with Iran.

In an attempt to calm tensions the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is due to visit Tehran next week as an unlikely mediator between the US and Iran. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, is also due to visit Tehran before Abe’s trip.

Germany remains a signatory to the nuclear deal signed in 2015 from which Donald Trump withdrew in May 2018.

Trump then pursued a policy of strong economic sanctions on Iran but he has dialled down his bellicose rhetoric in the last week, waiting to see if any of the mediators can find a basis for setting up direct talks between him and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president. Iran will demand the lifting of economic sanctions as a precondition of talks.

On Friday Tehran again ruled out extending the nuclear deal to cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme, something the French president, Emmanuel Macron, suggested should be addressed this week.

France, Germany and the UK have stood by the nuclear deal but have largely failed to find a financial mechanism that protects European companies from the threat of US sanctions if they trade with Tehran. Iran’s oil exports have plummeted and there is a lively debate in Tehran on whether it is tenable to hold out against talks.

Iran is due to show reporters around its heavy water reactor in an attempt to show the implications of the measures it is taking to increase the level of enriched uranium. In response to the US economic pressure, Tehran says it is taking steps to extricate itself from the deal, with the next steps on uranium enrichment due in 30 days.

Germany and Japan are certain to urge Iran to hold back from taking any steps that could be interpreted as abandoning the deal.","An unidentified state actor has been blamed for attacks on four oil tankers in the Gulf last month, according to an inconclusive inquiry that stopped short of explicitly pointing the finger at Iran.

1,"Iran backed down in Gulf due to US 'deterrence', says American general",Associated Press,"Head of central command says he remains concerned about ‘very real’ threat and Tehran’s potential for aggression

Iran backed down in Gulf due to US 'deterrence', says American general

Iran has chosen to “step back and recalculate” after making preparations for an apparent attack against US forces in the Gulf region, but it is too early to conclude the threat is gone, the top commander of American forces in the Mideast said on Thursday.

In an interview with three reporters accompanying him to the Gulf, General Frank McKenzie, the head of US central command, said he remained concerned by Iran’s potential for aggression, and he would not rule out requesting additional US forces to bolster defences against Iranian missiles or other weapons.

“I don’t actually believe the threat has diminished,” McKenzie said. “I believe the threat is very real.”

Tensions between the US and Iran have worsened since Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and several world powers, and reinstated sanctions on Tehran. Last month, in response to what American officials characterised as an imminent threat, the US announced it would rush an aircraft carrier and other assets to the region.

The US also blamed Iran for last month’s attacks on oil tankers in a United Arab Emirates port.

On Thursday, United Nations ambassadors from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Norway told UN security council members that investigators believe those attacks were led by a foreign state using divers on speed boats who planted mines on the vessels. They did not name Iran.

Earlier, the Saudi ambassador to the UN, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, said Saudi Arabia also blamed Iran for the sabotage.

In Baghdad, McKenzie told reporters that US redeployments to the Gulf have “caused the Iranians to back up a little bit, but I’m not sure they are strategically backing down.”

The general said the US is showing enough force to “establish deterrence” without “needlessly” provoking its longtime adversary. “We’re working very hard to walk that line.”

He said: “We’ve taken steps to show the Iranians that we mean business in our ability to defend ourselves,” referring to the accelerated deployment to the Gulf area of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, four Air Force B-52 bombers and additional batteries of Army Patriot air-defence systems.

Trump, speaking beside French president, Emmanuel Macron, in French city of Caen, France, said US sanctions were crippling Iran’s economy, possibly yielding a diplomatic opening.

“And if they want to talk, that’s fine,” the US president Trump said. “We’ll talk. But the one thing that they can’t have is they can’t have nuclear weapons.”

Speaking at the Baghdad headquarters of the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, McKenzie said he also has repositioned surveillance aircraft to more closely monitor the situation in the Gulf and in Iraq, where the U.S. has 5,200 troops on the ground, and has given Iran a “new look” by introducing more aerial patrols by land- and carrier-based fighters.

“Cumulatively, all of these have caused them to sort of step back and recalculate the course that they apparently were on,” he said.","“I don’t actually believe the threat has diminished,” McKenzie said.

2,Peterborough byelection result: Labour scrapes past Brexit party to hold seat,Rajeev Syal,"Labour has held on to the marginal seat of Peterborough, overturning predictions that the contest could deliver a first byelection victory for Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.

The victorious Labour candidate, Lisa Forbes, told her supporters after the count early on Friday: “Tonight’s result is significant because it shows that the politics of division will never win.”

Forbes won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party’s Mike Greene, who took 9,801 votes, a margin of 683. The Conservatives were beaten into third place with 7,243 votes. Turnout was 48%.

Farage left the count through a backdoor minutes before the result was announced.

After the result, Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories had been pushed to the margins because of the government cuts and its disastrous handling of Brexit.

“This result shows that in spite of the divisions and deadlock over Brexit, when it comes to a vote on the issues that directly affect people’s lives, Labour’s case for real change has strong support across the country. I look forward to welcoming Lisa to parliament next week,” he said.

Greene said the Brexit party had made a significant breakthrough, despite not winning. “We have shaken up British politics with none of the data that is necessary to win a parliamentary election,” he said. “We’ve had two parties ruling for decades, that’s not happening any more.”

Speaking on Friday morning, Farage insisted his party had done well. “Whichever way you cut it, we’ve come from nowhere, produced a massive result,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We haven’t quite got over the line but we’re pretty buoyed by this.”

He added: “Here’s the important thing – eight weeks ago today the Brexit party launched. And I think what you’ve seen from this result last night is that British politics has fundamentally changed. It’s no longer just two parties contesting.”

Farage said the relatively high Conservative vote was the key factor: “There are now seats like this, over the country, where voters are going to start to realise that if you vote Conservative you’re going to finish up with a Corbyn government. Once that gets through we’ll begin to see tactical voting.”

Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, told BBC1’s Breakfast that the party had “won against the odds, and I’m absolutely delighted”.

He said: “It’s a very good night for Labour. And there’s really no other way to try to spin this. We were supposed to lose – we won.”

Stewart Jackson, the former Conservative MP for Peterborough, said the Tories suffered because of the failings of the parliamentary party. “There has been no leader and Brexit policy has been a shambles. Once we deliver Brexit, and get a new leader in place, I think this seat will be back in contention,” he said.

The Liberal Democrats came fourth in the byelection with 4,159 with the Greens fifth with 1,035 votes.

Brexit party insiders said Labour’s reliance upon a mainly Pakistani vote in inner-city wards had been the difference between the parties.

Labour dismissed the theory a “racist trope”.

The result is a setback for Farage’s fledgling party, which argues for a no-deal departure from Europe and made a strong showing in last month’s European elections, securing the largest share of the vote and winning 29 seats. This was the first Westminster constituency it has contested since it was founded four months ago.

Although an opposition party is expected to win byelections, Labour was seeking victory in a seat where 60% of people voted to leave the EU.

Labour activists acknowledged they also had to combat anger over the party’s selection of Fiona Onasanya as its last candidate. She was forced to stand down following a recall petition after lying to police about a speeding ticket.

The victory will help Corbyn in his fight with critics within the party who have tried to persuade the Labour leader to change course over Brexit. Shadow cabinet members such as Emily Thornberry have urged him to strongly campaign for a second referendum.

Other senior figures, such as the party chair Ian Lavery, have argued that Labour will be decimated in parts of northern England and Wales if it attempts to run another referendum.","Labour has held on to the marginal seat of Peterborough, overturning predictions that the contest could deliver a first byelection victory for Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.

4,High court quashes bid to prosecute Boris Johnson over false referendum claim about cost of EU - live news,Kate Lyons,"10:25

The Peterborough byelection result confirms that the issue of Brexit has turned the UK’s two-party system into a four-party system, Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain’s most respected psephologist, told the Today programme this morning.

Labour’s Lisa Forbes won the byelection with 30.9% of the vote over the Brexit party, which got 28.9%. The Conservative, who held the seat for 12 years until 2015, came third with 21.4%, and the Liberal Democrats fourth on 12.3%.

Curtice said that in the last general election in 2017 the two traditional main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, shared 95% of the vote in Peterborough, but got only 52.3% in the byelection. He told Today:

Brexit has become such an important issue that rather than our traditional system of two-party politics, at the moment at least, we’ve got a system of four party politics. The two traditional parties, that are much happier talking about issues other than Brexit, have been joined by two parties: the Brexit party at one end of the spectrum; and the Liberal Democrats on the other, who are quite happy to carry on talking about Brexit. That’s the issue on which they are united and on which they seem to be winning votes.

Labour’s share of the vote in Peterborough was up nine percentage points compared to it disastrous showing in the European election. But Curtice said senior Labour figures could not pretend that the party was not losing support over Brexit.

The idea, that the Labour party has been coming at this morning, that this all goes to show that the whole argument about Brexit and the legacy of the European election can be ignored, is wrong.

The Peterborough result was consistent with recent opinion polls, he said and added: “Not as dramatic as the European elections but still more than enough to disrupt our usual politics.”

He pointed out that Labour’s vote in Peterborough represented the “smallest share of the vote that has ever been sufficient to win a general election in postwar British politics.”

Meanwhile, the Conservatives lost more than half the vote share they won in 2017, Curtice said:

Some of the immediate pressure on both the Conservative and Labour Party will be thought to be eased, but if anybody comes away from this and thinks, ‘Oh, actually, you know, the impact that Brexit is having on our politics is beginning to disappear and dissipate’. Well, maybe it will eventually. But it certainly isn’t doing so yet on the evidence this byelection. Unless and until the Conservative party can deliver Brexit, it is going to be in trouble. And it remains the case that it looks as though the Labour party’s position on Brexit is not anything like adequate for the Labour party to be able to retain the kinds of support they had in the 2017 election.","Labour’s Lisa Forbes won the byelection with 30.9% of the vote over the Brexit party, which got 28.9%.

7,Russian TV to air its own patriotic retelling of Chernobyl story,Andrew Roth,"Russian version will revolve around role of a CIA agent before the nuclear accident

Russian state TV is set to air its own drama about the deadly 1986 Chernobyl disaster – but unlike the HBO series, which has transfixed viewers around the world, this version will claim that a CIA spy was present for the worst nuclear accident in history.

Chernobyl, which will air on Russia’s NTV channel, appears to fulfil a demand from tabloid columnists and state TV news for a more patriotic retelling of the story.

Chernobyl: horrifying, masterly television that sears on to your brain Read more

Craig Mazin, the director of the HBO series, famously obsessed over minor details such as shoelaces and telephones, and adopted first-hand accounts of survivors to authentically recreate the Soviet Union of the 1980s.

NTV’s Chernobyl, filmed in Belarus, takes far more liberties. A description of the show says that the plot revolves around a CIA agent dispatched to Pripyat to gather intelligence on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the Russian counterintelligence agent sent to track him down.

If it sounds like fiction, that’s because it is. But the director, Alexey Muradov, said the show “will tell viewers about what really happened back then”.

“There is a theory that the Americans had infiltrated the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and many historians do not deny that on the day of the explosion an agent of the enemy’s intelligence services was present at the station,” Muradov told the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, which said the show “proposes an alternative view on the tragedy in Pripyat”.

State-run television and Russian tabloids have accused the HBO series of bias by papering over the heroic acts of Soviet emergency workers, the so-called “liquidators”.

“Chernobyl did not show the most important part – our victory,” ran one headline in Komsomolskaya Pravda, the country’s most popular daily.

Another article by the prominent war correspondent Dmitry Steshin in the same paper claimed the show was filmed in order to sabotage overseas sales of nuclear energy technology by the Russian state company Rosatom.

8,Eiffel Tower revamp to turn roads into garden in heart of Paris,Kim Willsher,"A garden stretches for a mile, free of cars with one of the world’s most recognisable monuments at its centre. Crossing the river on a tree-lined and lawned bridge, the roar of traffic has been replaced by the sound of water from fountains.

Such is the vision for the Eiffel Tower, which is at the centre of a major makeover project to transform one of Paris’s most visited districts.

At the heart of the revamp is a pedestrian-friendly plan to create the city’s largest garden. The landscape design, drawn up by a London-based company, will also turn a nearby bridge, the Pont d’Iéna, into a grassy, tree-lined walkway linking riverside gardens either side of the Seine with pools, fountains and mini-parks.

The first stage of the project, financed by the company that operates the Eiffel Tower, should be completed by 2024 in time for the Olympics.

It is the latest element in a concerted campaign led by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to reduce the number of vehicles in the French capital. Hidalgo, who faces re-election in 2020, has already closed long stretches of both riverside highways to vehicles. She has also revamped seven of the city’s major squares, restricting roads and giving more space to pedestrians, cyclists and scooters. She says she wants Paris to become a city “where you can let go of your child’s hand”.

“We’re really aiming for a high pedestrian target. We’re going to have a splendid garden where we can hear the birds sing,” she said when she announced the Eiffel Tower project last month. “It’s a place that will become a space for walking, strolling and breathing … Nature will take its place once more alongside this exceptional heritage.”

Mary Bowman, of Gustafson Porter + Bowman, which won a competition to redesign the area around the Eiffel Tower, said the aim was to unify the site from the Trocadéro to the École Militaire via the Palais de Chaillot, the Pont d’Iéna and the Champ de Mars to create a “biodiverse corridor”.

“This is a fantastic project to be working on as a landscape architect. The iconic nature of the site make it a once-in-a-lifetime chance for us, and an honour and privilege,” Bowman told the Guardian.

The Eiffel Tower has about 7 million visitors a year, though many millions more go to stand and look at the Dame de Fer, one of the most recognisable symbols in the world and an object of engineering beauty. The area around it, however, is less inspiring, comprising busy highways and the neat but soulless Champ de Mars, which has never quite shaken off its former use as a military parade ground.

The project plans to surround the tower with a mix of picturesque gardens and what the designers call “hard plazas” that could be used for a variety of public events throughout the year.

“Paris is the name of the climate agreement and to have a 54-hectare site in the middle of it that can show how one can begin to create a more green space in the heart of a major city and have it available and accessible to everyone, not just millions of tourists, is fantastic,” Bowman said.

“One of the things Anne Hidalgo mentioned about four of the shortlisted schemes was that they reinforced the idea of creating a pedestrian site so you could have this connection between the right and left banks. There is a phased approach. Creating pedestrian areas was a very strong part of our project.

“We would like to restrict private cars and turn it back to nature, but we are just beginning to enter into a period of discussions with the city and the traffic people about how that can be done.”

The Pont d’Iéna would be covered with lawns and the pavements either side would be turned into passages for public transport and emergency vehicles. The project includes the creation of facilities for tourists to drop off luggage in front of the Eiffel Tower.

The second stage, which will begin after the 2024 Olympics, is expected to be completed by 2030.

A public consultation has opened into the €72m (£64m) project and work is due to start at the end of next year or the beginning of 2021.

The lobby group 40 Million Motorists, however, has accused Hidalgo of wanting to turn Paris into a “museum city” after she announced plans to turn the four central arrondissements into a “restricted zone” for cars.

“Paris is not a museum. It is an economic heartland, where millions of people come, sometimes from far away, to work every day and need to do so easily … where will the mayor’s obsession with eradicating cars end?” it said in a statement.

It said the pedestrianisation of swathes of the city did not improve air quality but pushed pollution elsewhere. “All of this is just ideology,” it added.

Jean-Louis Missika, a Paris deputy mayor, said that city hall was determined to press ahead with schemes to reduce road traffic. He said cars took up half the public space, but only 13% of journeys were made in them and most spent 95% of their time in garages or parking spaces.

“All we’re doing is rebalancing the public space given to cars,” he said.

Missika said the city was working on introducing a car-sharing scheme following on from its pioneering bike rental scheme, Vélib’, and more recently, electric scooters.

“We have a lack of green spaces in Paris, which is a very dense city,” he said, adding that city hall aimed to create more public spaces from tens of thousands of square metres currently used for parking.

He said initial public reactions to the Eiffel Tower project were encouraging. “People seem to like it. A lot.”

Bowman added: “It’s a fantastic project also for raising the profile of landscape architects who should be leading the climate debate.”","Such is the vision for the Eiffel Tower, which is at the centre of a major makeover project to transform one of Paris’s most visited districts.

Mexico tightens southern border security as another day passes with no tariff deal

As Donald Trump’s deadline for new tariffs on Mexican imports draws near, Mexico has stepped up security along its porous border with Guatemala – deploying police and soldiers to its southern frontier and arresting prominent migration activists.

Trump last week pledged to impose 5% tariffs on Mexican products on 10 June unless Mexico stops Central American migrants from travelling through its territory.

US and Mexican officials met for a second day on Thursday to avert the tariffs, but have not reached an agreement.

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, said in Pennsylvania on Thursday that the US was “encouraged” by Mexico’s latest proposals but that, so far, tariffs still were set to take effect on Monday.

He added that it would be “for the president to decide” whether Mexico was doing enough to head off the tariffs.

Pence said that, among other issues, negotiators had been discussing a potential agreement to make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the US. Mexico has long resisted that request.

The Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, took office six months ago promising to protect migrants’ rights and avoid doing the “dirty work” of any foreign government.

Migrant arrests by US border patrol hit highest level since 2007 Read more

But as US officials reiterated Trump’s threats this week, their counterparts south of the border have made a show of taking steps to stem the flow of migrants streaming out of Central America.

Mexican immigration officials and navy marines corralled a caravan of Central American migrants on Wednesday, less than a day after it crossed into the country and marched up the highway under the scorching hot sun.

The column of men women and children had barely walked 12km on Mexican soil before it was stopped; previous caravans have successfully travelled nearly 4,000km across the length of the country to the US border.

“We have the full right to do it, we’re a sovereign country, we have migratory laws, which we have to apply and have to be respected,” said the interior minister, Olga Sánchez Cordero.

On the same day, police arrested two members of the migrants’ rights organisation Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Borders), which coordinates caravans crossing Mexico.

Pueblos Sin Frontera said the detentions followed a pattern of harassment from the authorities in both countries against individuals assisting migrants and an attempt at “criminalising” the caravans.

On Thursday the finance ministry’s financial intelligence unit announced it had blocked the accounts of 26 people for “their probable link with human trafficking and illicit support of migrant caravans”.

Recent weeks have already seen a proliferation of immigration checkpoints in southern Mexico and police raids on migrant centers.

A string of caravans – some of them as many as 5,000 people – have set out from Central America over the past year. Caravan members have told reporters that large numbers offer safety from bandits and corrupt police officers and that the groups coalesced organically, often after they were promoted on social media.

But the Mexican government fears Trump’s tariffs will damage the manufacturing-for-export economy.

Figures released this week showed arrests at the US-Mexico border reached their highest level in a decade.

Observers say Mexico prefers not to mix issues such as trade and immigration in its dealings with the US, but the Trump administration is attempting to push ever increasing responsibility for stopping migrants to its southern neighbour.

“They want Mexico to stop migrants by all means possible,” said Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the Strauss Center at the University of Texas. “They want to outsource both enforcement and asylum processing, it seems.”

In the negotiations on Thursday in Washington, Mexico reportedly offered to send 6,000 members of its newly formed national guard – a militarised police with immigration enforcement powers – to its southern border.

US negotiators also proposed returning detained Guatemalans to Mexico and sending asylum seekers from El Salvador and Honduras back to Guatemala, according to the Washington Post.

Mexico’s foreign ministry spokesman, Roberto Velasco Álvarez, tweeted on Thursday that no agreement had been reached, but added: “The US position is focused on migratory control measures. Ours is on development.”

López Obrador has promoted development in Central America as the solution to slowing migration, though analysts say such plans would take decades to unfold.

Meanwhile, the factors driving migrants from Central America – hunger, climate change, unemployment, crime and violence – remain in place.

“People don’t stop leaving their countries of origins,” said Salva Lacruz, coordinator with the Fray Matías de Córdova Human Rights Centre in Tapachula.

11,Exclusive: US homeopaths claim 'therapies' prevent measles and 'cure' autism,Ed Pilkington,"Thousands of American children are being put on homeopathic alternatives to vaccination by practitioners who claim they can prevent measles and “cure” autism, the Guardian has learned.

At least 200 homeopaths in the US are practicing a controversial “therapy” known as Cease that falsely asserts that it has the power to treat and even cure autism. The acronym stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression.

The “therapy” relies in part on administering high doses of vitamin C. Advocates falsely say it repairs the harm caused by vaccination – a double untruth as most vaccines are safe and there is no link between vaccines and autism, a condition for which there is no cure.

In addition 250 homeopaths, some of whom also practice Cease, are promoting “homeoprophylaxis” that advertises itself as an “immunological education program”. More than 2,000 American children have been put on the program which claims to build natural immunity against infectious diseases, though there is no scientific evidence that it works.

Parents who opt to follow Cease or homeoprophylaxis are potentially exposing their children, as well as others around them, to life-threatening illness. The implicit message behind both therapies is that vaccines are harmful and should be avoided.

The spread of such ideas, amplified through the proliferation of anti-vaxxer theories on social media, has begun to have a profound impact on public health in the US. Last month the number of measles cases reached a 25-year peak.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,001 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in more than 20 states this year alone.

Scientists and public health experts warn that the eruption of measles is clearly connected to the proliferation of “vaccine hesitancy” – an unwillingness by parents to have their children vaccinated that was recently listed by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 threats to global health.

More than 100 hotspots in which large numbers of children are now going unvaccinated have been identified across the nation. Of those, 15 are in urban areas. Seven of the 15 have experienced measles outbreaks in 2019.

“These measles outbreaks were both predicted and predictable as the anti-vaccine movement starts to affect public health in this country,” said Peter Hotez, professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. “This is just the beginning – it is a harbinger of a new normal in America.”

Hotez, who has an autistic daughter and who has written a book debunking the false link between vaccines and autism, said of the claims propagated by homeoprophylaxis and Cease: “There are no alternatives to vaccination against measles and there is no cure to autism – so it’s all made up.”

A leading advocate of both programs is Kate Birch, a homeopath based in Minnesota who said she imported homeoprophylaxis into the US in 2008 having learnt about it in Cuba. She has trained 250 practitioners in its thinking, 80 of whom she still supervises.

She added that there are now some 2,000 children across America under their direction.

Birch’s organization, Free and Healthy Children, is constituted as a 501(c)3 public education charity, allowing it to operate free of federal tax. On its website it clearly states its anti-vaccine ideology, proclaiming that its members “are concerned about the alarming incidence of immune system disturbances and developmental delays affecting so many children as a result of the current-day vaccination programs”.

An associated website run by Birch, vaccinefree, claims that “homeopathic remedies can be used preventatively for measles”.

In an interview with the Guardian, Birch said that homeoprophylaxis strengthened children’s immunity to infectious diseases using “nosodes” – homeopathic remedies made from “pathological disease tissue”. They are taken orally in diluted form.

She claimed nosodes were regulated in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In fact, the FDA can and does take action against specific homeopathic manufacturers for putting patients at risk, but it does not approve homeopathic products.

The Guardian put it to Birch that the anti-vaccination message of homeoprophylaxis and Cease was contributing to a public health crisis manifested by the spread of measles. She said her work was dedicated to the “betterment of public health by strengthening children’s immune system to infectious disease”.

She added that in her opinion exposing children to infectious disease by leaving them unvaccinated was a good thing. “We need infectious disease,” she said. “The best immunity to childhood infectious disease is through natural exposure and then you have lifelong immunity”.

The last time that the American public relied on “natural exposure” to measles – that is, before the US measles vaccination program began in 1963 – the disease caused untold human suffering. Up to 4 million Americans contracted it each year, of whom almost 50,000 were hospitalized and 500 died annually.

The Guardian asked the FDA to state its current position on both Cease and homeoprophylaxis. The agency did not comment on the two programs specifically, but said in a statement that the “FDA has warned about the use of products labeled as homeopathic because of concerns that they have not been shown to offer clinical benefits in treating serious and/or life-threatening medical conditions, and that they also may cause serious harm.”

The FDA added: “It deeply concerns us when we see preventable diseases such as measles – a life-threatening infection we thought we had eliminated in the US in 2000 – now making a tragic comeback and threatening our communities, despite having a vaccine available that is safe and highly effective. A factor contributing to the measles outbreak is inaccurate and misleading information about vaccines rather than the reliance on accurate, scientific-based information.”","Thousands of American children are being put on homeopathic alternatives to vaccination by practitioners who claim they can prevent measles and “cure” autism, the Guardian has learned.

12,Israeli tycoon 'hired intelligence firm to influence tax policy',Press Association,"An Israeli investigative TV show has claimed that one of the country’s richest men hired the Israeli intelligence firm Black Cube to dig up dirt on a cabinet minister. Black Cube denied the allegations.



Idan Ofer allegedly hired the firm in 2014 to investigate the then-finance minister Yair Lapid and other top officials, Uvda reported, as part of his efforts to influence tax policy on natural gas finds at the time.



Ofer, a billionaire with vast holdings in the shipping, drilling and mining industries, paid Black Cube to help him undermine an advisory panel appointed by Lapid that was aiming to raise taxes on his lucrative natural resources company, according to the TV investigation. The idea was to smear Lapid and the arbitrators in order to continue evading high taxes on his profits after Israel discovered a large offshore natural gas field.



Black Cube, a company of former Israeli intelligence agents, has drawn international attention for allegedly working to discredit officials within the former US president Barack Obama’s administration who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement, as well as to protect the reputation of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Thursday’s investigation also explored Black Cube’s ties to former president of the Democratic Republic of Congo Joseph Kabila, who reportedly used the company’s services to suppress opposition activists.



Black Cube denied the allegations, saying it never met with Ofer or targeted politicians, judges or regulators. The company said it was suing the TV show and its anchor in a British court for £15m. A clerk at Britain’s Royal Courts of Justice confirmed that a lawsuit had been filed but said he was barred from providing further details.



A spokesman for Ofer confirmed he had contracted the agency for a brief period, but said Ofer ended up not using Black Cube’s intelligence. He stressed the company gathered evidence only from public sources.



Lapid, now co-leader of the opposition Blue and White party, said nothing influences his decisions and he would “keep working without fearing anyone”.","An Israeli investigative TV show has claimed that one of the country’s richest men hired the Israeli intelligence firm Black Cube to dig up dirt on a cabinet minister.

13,"Sleep apps backfire by causing anxiety and insomnia, says expert",Hannah Devlin,"Smartphone sleep-tracking apps are making people so anxious and obsessed about their sleep that they are developing insomnia, a leading neurologist has said.

Speaking at the Cheltenham science festival, Dr Guy Leschziner, a sleep disorder specialist and consultant at Guy’s hospital in London, said a growing preoccupation with getting enough sleep was backfiring.

“We’ve seen a lot of people who have developed significant insomnia as a result of either sleep trackers or reading certain things about how devastating sleep deprivation is for you,” Leschziner said before his talk.

A high proportion of patients seeking treatment for insomnia turn up at his clinic with data about their sleep patterns and are often reluctant to delete the app, he said. “It’s rather difficult to dissuade them from using it.”

Most apps have not been clinically validated and only track movement, so do not provide insight into the quality of sleep, he added.

“My view of sleep trackers is fairly cynical. If you wake up feeling tired and you’ve had an unrefreshing night’s sleep then you know you’ve got a problem,” he said. “If you wake up every day and feel refreshed, are awake throughout the day and are ready to sleep at the same time every night then you’re probably getting enough sleep for you and you don’t need an app to tell you that.”

Similar concerns were highlighted in a series of case studies published last year by a team in Chicago that described patients whose micromanagement of sleep using apps had led to a disorder called orthosomnia.

Research shows that for most people the optimum amount of sleep is around eight hours, but this varies widely across the population. For people who naturally need less sleep, being alerted to the fact that they are not sleeping “enough” could result in the nocebo effect, where the expectation of negative symptoms leads to people actually feeling worse.

Speaking in the same session at the festival, Stephanie Romiszewski, a sleep psychologist based in Exeter, said: “Everybody sleeps differently and can have a different duration. And therefore if you take a generic sleep tracker and it [says] you haven’t had the right amount of sleep, that can start to worry you.”

Some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) apps, however, have been found to be effective in treating insomnia in trials.

The festival was told that people should also take a relaxed approach to advice on caffeine consumption and blue light exposure before bedtime. “Caffeine is only applicable if caffeine disrupts your sleep,” said Leschziner. “There are genes that influence how your brain processes caffeine and so there are many people who drink two or three cups of espresso before they go to bed and not have any impact at all on their sleep.”

Genetics also influence the extent to which blue light disrupts the evening peak in the sleep hormone, melatonin. “If your sleep is a really good quality and you can sit there and watch Netflix until 11 o’clock at night, close your computer and then drift off to sleep and have a great night’s sleep then you don’t need to worry about it,” he said. “We know that sensitivity to blue light various tremendously.”

Leshchziner said measuring sleep was part of a broader tendency to “metricise our lives” using technology to count how many steps we have taken, how many online friends we have and how we spend our money. With sleep, this trend is particularly problematic, he said. “If you’re measuring your steps and you realise you’re not walking as far as you should you just do a bit more exercise. When you get into that obsessive state about sleep it makes sleep even more difficult.”","Smartphone sleep-tracking apps are making people so anxious and obsessed about their sleep that they are developing insomnia, a leading neurologist has said.

14,Fourteen lions escape from Kruger park in South Africa,Jason Burke,"Authorities in South Africa have warned residents living close to the Kruger park after 14 lions escaped from the world-famous reserve.

The state government of Limpopo said the pride of lions had been seen near the town of Phalaborwa, close to the borders with Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It warned members of the public to be “alert at all times” until the animals were recaptured.

“We want to assure the public that they need not panic as the situation is under control,” Zaid Kalla, a provincial government spokesperson, told local media.

It was not clear how the lions had escaped from the park, which is surrounded by fences designed to protect animals and local communities.

Local authorities said the lions would be returned to the park after recapture despite criticism from a spokesman for the Kruger who said the plan was not “feasible”.

The lions “will continually break out as other dominant lions will chase them out,” a spokesman, Ike Phaahla, told South African state television.

“We need to identify a park where they can be taken and establish their own area … There is the possibility of wildlife-human conflict, so people have to be careful,” he said.

It was not clear how long the lions had been at large. Experts say the fence around the park is in good condition but that it can never stop all movements by animals.

The Kruger park covers nearly 2m hectares and is home to over 500 bird species, 147 mammal species. An estimated 2,000 lions live in the park.

A suspected rhino poacher was trampled by elephants then eaten by a pride of lions in the Kruger in April. Earlier this week, a leopard killed a two-year-old boy inside a fenced-off staff compound in the Kruger.

A team of rangers shot dead two leopards to avoid the risk of further attacks.","Authorities in South Africa have warned residents living close to the Kruger park after 14 lions escaped from the world-famous reserve.

15,"When in Rome, don't dress as a centurion, say city authorities",Angela Giuffrida,"Messy eating near monuments and singing on public transport are also banned by new rules

Dressed as a gladiator, Remi Sanz, a visitor from Spain, was unaware that his outfit might land him in trouble as he hung around Rome’s famous Trevi Fountain on Friday morning.

Authorities in the Italian capital have now enforced a slew of rules, updated from legislation drafted in 1946, as they seek to clamp down on uncouth behaviour that has long been a source of frustration. One of the measures is a permanent ban on modern-day centurions – men who dress up in tunics and leather breastplates, wielding plastic swords – and make money by posing for photos.

Sanz is not a centurion – he is in Rome with a group of friends for his stag do – but he might be mistaken for one.

“We just dressed up like this for fun,” he said. “So long as I don’t make a disturbance, I guess I’ll be OK. The bad thing would be to get drunk while dressed like this. I can understand such rules and I’m glad to know about them now.”

But it wasn’t just Sanz. The Trevi Fountain area was full of people unwittingly committing transgressions, particularly those flouting the ban on “messy” eating near monuments.

“This is against the law now?” asked Giuseppe, a visitor from central Italy, as he tucked into pizza while standing by a church opposite the fountain. “I didn’t know, but I think it’s a good thing. They have a similar law in Venice. You shouldn’t be eating by monuments and making a mess.”

Clara Jankovitch, a tourist from Hungary, was perched on the steps of the church enjoying an ice-cream.

“I can understand pizza and sandwiches, but surely an ice-cream is OK? Look around, everyone is eating one,” she said.

It is unclear whether people will be served a penalty for such infractions or simply get a ticking off from the tourist police patrolling historic sites, but Rome authorities have promised “severe fines” for those caught taking a dip in the city’s fountains – a frequent occurrence during the summer.

Other rules include bans on wheeled suitcases and buggies being dragged down historic staircases, walking around bare-chested, and pub crawls. The authorities are also taking aim at “nuisance drunks” or people who sing on public transport, as well as those who wrap their mouths around the nozzles of the city’s drinking fountains. Illegal street trading and ticket touting outside tourist sights have also been banned, as has the Roman custom of hanging laundry out to dry between neighbouring buildings.

“Old regulations have been updated to adapt to the needs of a modern society,” said Marco Cardilli, deputy chief of staff and security delegate at Rome’s council.","Authorities in the Italian capital have now enforced a slew of rules, updated from legislation drafted in 1946, as they seek to clamp down on uncouth behaviour that has long been a source of frustration.

'The last fight for Hong Kong': activists gear up over extradition law

It has been called “the nail in Hong Kong’s coffin”, a bill that activists say will “legitimise Chinese abduction” from the city. But the city’s legislators are pushing ahead with the controversial extradition law that will give mainland China the right to request the transfer of alleged criminals.

Opponents have geared up for a fight, with a rally on Sunday expected to draw up to half a million people onto the city’s streets. The demonstration is supported by human rights and legal groups and the leaders of Hong Kong’s movement to preserve its tenuous grip on democracy.

They fear the law, which will have its second reading before the legislature next week, will be used by Beijing to target its political enemies. It has prompted despair from many, who worry it heralds the effective end of the city’s independence from China.

In its current form, the legislation would allow for case-by-case extraditions to mainland China and eliminate some oversight roles of the chief executive’s cabinet and the city’s legislative body. The legislature is seeking to pass it before the summer break in July.

Hong Kong's push to allow extraditions to China prompts protests Read more

“All they need is a witness statement saying you committed some crime 20 years ago,” says Martin Lee QC, a barrister, former legislator and leading pro-democracy figure. “That is enough, and then you’ll be tried according to Chinese law in a Chinese court. And who can trust that system?”

Critics have accused the Hong Kong administration, led by Carrie Lam, of being “Beijing’s puppet”. But Lam’s administration claims the bill closes a legal loophole. It says the law – and the rush to pass it – is justified because of the case of a Taiwanese man wanted for the murder of his girlfriend.

Eroding automony

Hong Kong’s independent legal system was protected under the laws governing the territory’s return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago and is seen by the financial hub’s business and diplomatic communities as its strongest remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing.

But the city’s independence – which is supposedly guaranteed until 2047 – has been slowly eroding, particularly since Xi Jinping took over as leader of the Communist Party in 2012.

Last year, six members of the Pan Democratic party were expelled from parliament and pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from by-elections. Leaders and organisers of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that occupied parts of the city for almost three months have been jailed.

These watershed moments, plus attempts to bring in national security laws, have created a citizenry hostile to any further encroachments from the mainland. The extradition bill appears to be the last straw. In Hong Kong’s parliament disagreements over the issue have led to literal blows.

‘The little boat is sinking’

Critics say the law heralds the end of the “one country, two systems” policy, under which Hong Kong has prospered as an international business and finance hub.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has expressed “serious reservations”, saying such measures “would undermine perceptions of Hong Kong as a safe and secure haven for international business operations.”

Observers also worry about politically motivated arrests of foreigners. Following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada, two Canadians were quickly detained in China.

In a joint statement, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said they were worried about the potential effect of the proposals on the “large number of UK and Canadian citizens in Hong Kong”.

Hong Kong extradition bill is 'terrible blow' to rule of law, says Patten Read more

The former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has warned that the law would be the “worst thing” to happen in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover. The law would “remove the firewall between Hong Kong’s rule of law and the idea of law which prevails in communist China” Patten said in video commentary posted online on Thursday. “An idea of law where there aren’t any independent courts, where the courts and the security services and the party’s rule, which are sometimes pretty obscure, are rolled all together,” he said, referring to China’s ruling Communist party.

Ray Wong, an independence activist now living in Berlin, this week said it was “the nail in Hong Kong’s coffin.”

“Because if this law is passed the legal system in Hong Kong will be destroyed. Hong Kong will be just another city in China,” he said.

Claudia Mo, legislator and member of the Pan Democratic party, agrees: “They are trying to integrate Hong Kong so much into the mainland to the point that Hong Kong is to be disappeared,” she says. “The little boat of Hong Kong is sinking fast.”

China’s history of targeting dissidents on unrelated charges is well documented. In 2015, five booksellers who published salacious fictional material about China’s leaders from Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay disappeared from their homes only for some to reappear in mainland China confessing to non-political crimes like 13-year-old traffic offences.

In 2008, journalist Cheong Ching was released after more than 1,000 days in jail for spying, in what he believes was retribution for writing an article critical of the Chinese Communist party.

Ching says had they admitted the article was the motivation, there would have been an “uproar”.

“[So] when the Hong Kong government says they aren’t going to send political prisoners to China, the problem is if China is making a request it will never be on political grounds.”

Lee, who has been referred to as Hong Kong’s “father of democracy”, is an internationally recognised campaigner for the political freedom the city was promised after 1997.

He predicts many businesses who have based themselves inside Hong Kong’s protective borders will pack up and go.

“How can you do business in China by observing all the laws in China? There are too many restrictions, so you cut corners and pay bribes,” he says.

But Pro-Beijing government members are resolute, and accuse the opposition of fear-mongering.

Regina Ip, a legislator and cabinet member, and a former secretary of security, says the bill is intended to fight crime across borders, and that mainland China is Hong Kong’s most important crime-fighting partner because of high cross-border traffic by offenders.

Ip has accused opponents of spreading “lies and falsehoods” about the new law and has dismissed concerns Beijing would abuse the system.

“We’re not facing a situation where any ordinary Hong Kong person, because of some past dispute in mainland China, can be whisked across the border,” she says.

“All the human rights guarantees are there.”

Ip is adamant that the international outcry and the protest on Sunday – no matter how big – will have no impact. “If you cave in because of mass protest, that will encourage people to organise more protests on all sorts of China-sensitive issues,” she says.

But opponents of the bill also believe losing the battle is not an option. “This is now I think the last fight for Hong Kong,” says Lee.

26,El Chapo: what the rise and fall of the kingpin reveals about the war on drugs,Jessica Loudis,"Just after midday on Tuesday 12 February, word came down that the verdict was ready in what had been widely described as the trial of the century. “United States of America v Joaquín Guzmán Loera” had lasted approximately three months – it took prosecutors that long to present what they described as “an avalanche” of evidence, which had taken more than a decade to compile. The government called 56 witnesses, the defence called only one: an FBI agent, who finished testifying within an hour.

There was little expectation that Guzmán would mount a convincing defence. The diminutive 61-year-old (his nickname, El Chapo, means “shorty” in Spanish) was known around the world as a leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, and the most high-profile drug kingpin since Pablo Escobar. In addition to smuggling thousands of tonnes of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic narcotics across the US-Mexico border, he had successfully pulled off two dramatic escapes from prisons in Mexico. He has been the subject of dozens of books, two popular TV series and, in 2009, was included in Forbes magazine’s list of billionaires. The following year, that same magazine named Guzmán one of the world’s most-wanted fugitives, second to only Osama bin Laden. As Guzmán’s lawyers liked to tell anybody who would listen, even before their client set foot in Brooklyn, he had already been convicted in the court of public opinion.

When he was captured by Mexican marines on 8 January 2016, Guzmán became the prize feather in the cap of the country’s law enforcement. Barack Obama called Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto to congratulate him on the arrest, and in a move that could be interpreted either as a parting gift to Obama or a peace offering to his successor, Guzmán was extradited to New York on 19 January 2017, a day before Trump took office. Jack Riley, a retired Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) chief who recently published a book about his role in Guzmán’s arrest, told me that in the view of US authorities, catching El Chapo was an important warning to criminals around the world. Regardless of where you are, if you are breaking American laws, “eventually, we’re going to get you”.

Americans spend around $109bn on illegal drugs each year, and Bloomberg estimates that the Sinaloa cartel makes at least $11bn in annual sales to the US. But while Mexican cartels regularly appear in the US media, most people are unfamiliar with the circumstances that contributed to their rise. It is not common knowledge that Mexico launched its own war on drugs in the mid-2000s, or that the biggest cartels are sophisticated operations worth billions of dollars. Nor are many people aware that cartels are increasingly responsible for fentanyl, a form of synthetic heroin, entering the US. In an address to the media after the verdict was handed down, US government officials emphasised this point and the role of illegal fentanyl in perpetuating the opioids crisis.

While the workings of his business may be a mystery, Americans have heard of El Chapo. By the time he appeared in court in 2018, he was a late-night TV punchline, a symbol of extreme wealth and an escape artist with a talent for leaving law enforcement with their hands empty.

At the trial, Guzmán was found guilty of all charges against him, including the most serious – having engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise. He will be sentenced at the end of June, and is almost certain to be jailed for life. His lawyers are seeking a retrial on the basis of jury misconduct, but the chances of that happening are slim.

When I was in Mexico City this spring, a month after the verdict, talk of the trial had already died down. Guzmán’s image had mostly disappeared from the magazine covers on display at the news kiosks that dot the streets of the capital. While people could still name the Sinaloa cartel’s leaders and lieutenants, they were more interested in the newer cartels, such as Jalisco Nueva Generación or the local La Unión. Many people didn’t want to discuss El Chapo at all. “Narco fatigue” – the exhaustion that comes with being oversaturated by news and pop culture about the drug trade – had long ago set in. Over the past 13 years, Mexico’s internal war on drugs has dominated the media, resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and failed to stop narcotrafficking.

Guzmán’s arrest did not magically rid Mexico, or the US, of violence or drugs. Above all, his trial demonstrated how disposable any single person is in the larger machinations of the narco-state. There has never been a clear definition of what exactly constitutes a cartel, and as smaller, more transient gangs replace larger organisations, going after leaders like Guzmán seems increasingly pointless. Rather than reducing the levels of violence and trafficking in Mexico, that approach – the so-called kingpin strategy, employed by Mexico and the US – has enabled new forms of crime to flourish. As Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, Chapo’s longtime partner, said in 2010 in a rare interview with the Mexican news magazine El Proceso, the problem of narcos isn’t going away: “As soon as capos are locked up, killed or extradited, their replacements are already around.”

Since the early 1990s, the US has targeted cartels via their leaders. It is a fairly straightforward idea: take out the head of an illegal organisation and the rest will collapse. The approach was developed to bring down the Colombian cartels, and in that case, it had some success. When Pablo Escobar was shot to death by Colombian police in 1993, his cartel went down with him.

But even as the structures of organised crime have evolved, US law enforcement has generally stuck to this top-down model. If they are not killing drug lords, they are using the American judicial system to make examples of them. Since 2001, when Mexico’s supreme court agreed to allow the extradition of criminals so long as they would not face the death penalty or life in prison (this ruling was amended four years later to permit life sentences), dozens of narcotraffickers have been extradited to the US, including members of the Tijuana, Beltrán-Leyva, Sinaloa and Los Zetas cartels. If Guzmán ends up in the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as he is expected to, he will share the facility with former Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas Guillén.

While Sinaloa has historically been, and still remains, Mexico’s most powerful cartel, the world it came up in no longer exists. Between the early 90s and the mid-2000s, the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Juárez and Gulf organisations were mini-monopolies, with borders that more or less stayed the same. Then, with the start of Mexico’s drug war in 2006, that arrangement started to fall apart. As Mexican and American authorities took out cartel leaders, groups fractured and new ones emerged.

Previously, the Zetas, whose leaders came from the special forces of the Mexican army, had been a mercenary group in the employ of the Gulf cartel. Now they became an autonomous organisation. Jalisco Nueva Generación, which had been linked to Sinaloa, morphed into one of Mexico’s most ferocious cartels. Splinter groups and gangs that had originated in prisons or as local militias began to gain power.

This fragmentation altered the way cartels do business. To distinguish themselves in a crowded field, the new groups pioneered the use of sadistic, headline-grabbing violence. They also diversified. Whereas an old-school cartel might have once only sold drugs, the upstarts are expanding into different forms of crime. The Zetas are notorious for stealing petrol from nationalised pipelines and selling it on the black market – a business that Sinaloa previously dominated, as journalist Ana Lilia Peréz documented in her book El Cartel Negro. The Santa Rosa de Lima cartel also specialises in petrol theft, known nationally as huachicol. Protection rackets are common. And cartels are kidnapping and extorting migrants on their way to the US border. In 2010, the bodies of 72 Central American migrants were found on a ranch in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. According to the lone survivor of the massacre, an 18-year-old Ecuadorian, the Zetas murdered the group when they refused to either pay for their freedom or serve as cartel hitmen.

At the same time, older cartels are expanding and decentralising. According to law and economics scholar Edgardo Buscaglia, Sinaloa has a presence in 54 countries and Jalisco Nueva Generación, one of Mexico’s fastest growing cartels, is said to have branched out throughout the Americas. Maintaining such operations requires a vast and diverse network of legal fronts and elaborate systems of money-laundering. To illustrate this point, the journalist Diego Osorno recently noted that the most popular brand of milk in Sinaloa is made by a company owned by Guzmán’s colleague El Mayo. The Sinaloa cartel operates on such a large scale – connecting manufacturers and distributors, bankers and businesses and extracting money at each step – that there is no longer a single face of the organisation. Buscaglia told me that that if I wanted to see the “sophisticated” side of the Sinaloa cartel, I should visit a particular gated community in Argentina. I wouldn’t find any gangsters flashing guns, he clarified, only the wealthy managers of the cartel’s legal operations in that country.

This fragmentation also means that cartels and low-level gangs are harder to police and prosecute. Paradoxically, there are also more mini-kingpins to capture. And once they are in the US, narcotraffickers can cut plea deals and help prosecutors capture their former bosses and colleagues. Captured Mexican narcos generally have few qualms about cooperating. A good outcome might mean a radically reduced sentence and half their fortune waiting for them on release. An even better outcome might resemble that of Andrés López López, one of the former leaders of Colombia’s Norte del Valle cartel. In 2006, López had an 11-year sentence knocked down to 20 months after working with authorities. Now based in Miami, he has written three books about trafficking, one of which was adapted into a wildly successful TV show in Latin America. His most recent book, which was also optioned for television, is a biography of El Chapo.

I first went to the Guzmán trial in early December, and began to go more frequently as a broader picture of cartel operations came into focus. In building the case, prosecutors approached it like a classic mafia roll-up, offering leniency to each captured narco and gradually working their way up the chain until they reached Guzmán. As Miami defence attorney Joaquin Perez, who has represented many extradited narcotraffickers, told me, it was a “significant effort for a fait accompli”.

It also made for good theatre. There were accounts of diamond-encrusted guns and cocaine stash houses in fancy Brooklyn neighbourhoods, million-dollar smuggling submarines capable of evading police radars and elaborate schemes to outwit US law enforcement. Week after week, witnesses described in intricate detail the inner workings of la oficina (the internal nickname for the cartel): its lavish displays of violence and wealth, its complex transportation networks and how Mexican authorities were systematically paid off. In search of material, screenwriters and actors showed up at the trial.

Tabloid headlines advertised the “wacky world” of the trial, and newspapers ran lists of its most bizarre disclosures. By the time the prosecution rested after 11 weeks of testimony, jurors had heard from Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, AKA “Chupeta” (lollipop), a formerly handsome Colombian kingpin who had undergone such extensive plastic surgery to stay in hiding that his face looked like a rubber Halloween mask; Jorge and Alex Cifuentes-Villa, brothers and Colombian career criminals who had worked closely with Guzmán; and Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, Guzmán’s mistress and one-time accomplice. Jorge Cifuentes-Villa described attempting to kill a man with a poisoned sandwich, and Alex told the jury that Guzmán had allegedly boasted about bribing former president Peña Nieto for $100m. (Peña Nieto’s former chief of staff described this claim as “false, defamatory and absurd”.)

Yet to many of the seasoned narco corresponsales, the trial offered few newsworthy revelations. “Everything that was astonishing to American audiences was not to Mexicans,” said David Brooks, the US correspondent for the progressive Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Mexican readers were no longer scandalised by accounts of extreme wealth or violence. Besides sex and infidelity, which were of universal interest, Brooks told me that the stories that landed with his readers were ones that named names, confirming that long-suspected officials had taken bribes or worked both sides of the table.

The more I spoke with the Mexican journalists, the more I became aware of the underlying issues going unaddressed in the courtroom. There were few mentions of the consequences of the war on drugs, which had led to the deaths of thousands of Mexicans. And because it was being held in the US, some saw the case as a finger in the eye of Mexican sovereignty, a serious injury to national pride. (There was some irritation over the fact that Guzmán was being tried, as several journalists grumbled, in a court where the judge couldn’t properly pronounce his name.)

At the same time, nobody seemed to think the trial should have been held in Mexico, where the police and judicial systems were too weak to guarantee that Guzmán wouldn’t escape jail for a third time. Again and again, I spoke with journalists and academics who described corruption in Mexico as something like a tide, a force that grew steadily and drew everything towards it. Police were underpaid, crime was lucrative and the government was compromised by the cartels. Political corruption, usually through campaign contributions or by laundering money through public procurement projects, is standard. When I asked people in Mexico City about the enthusiasm surrounding the new president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office in December 2018, I often heard that his willingness to take on corruption was his main selling point.

The basic problem in Mexico, Buscaglia told me, is that nobody is policing the courts. Mexico doesn’t audit judges or prosecutors, and lacks independent monitoring agencies. Despite recent reforms to the criminal justice system, Buscaglia does not think that Mexico currently has the capacity or political will to execute major organised crime cases like Italy did with its famous “Maxi trial” in the late 1980s. There, Sicilian prosecutors indicted 475 mafiosi over a six-year period. That, he added, indicates the most significant difference between Mexico and Italy: organised crime didn’t infiltrate the Mexican state – it helped shape it. “Politics in Mexico,” Buscaglia likes to tell people, “is the most sophisticated form of organised crime.”

Did the state shape the cartels, or was it the other way around? The standard narrative is that the cartels infiltrated the state, blurring the lines between police, politicians and traffickers. Others contend that government authorities exaggerated the power of the cartels in order to blame them for their own transgressions. It is possible some version of each is true. Either way, there is no single force in control.

There has never been a hard divide between the state and traffickers in Mexico. In the 1920s, farmers began growing poppy to meet US demand for opium, and after the second world war, representatives of what would become Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) were rumoured to have made handshake deals with smugglers, allowing them to export illicit crops across the border in exchange for a cut of the profits. The PRI was the de facto government for most of the 20th century – the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa once called Mexico under the PRI “the perfect dictatorship” – and during its tenure, politicians generally took a lax attitude towards the drug trade, regarding drugs as more of a health issue than a criminal one.

By the 1980s, narcos had solidified their power by divvying up trafficking routes and letting groups run their own territories. At the time cocaine trafficking was starting to become big business in Mexico. When the US DEA began targeting Colombian cocaine distribution routes between the Caribbean and Miami, the cartels had found an alternative in the Mexican “trampoline”. Traffickers started moving shipments across the porous US-Mexico border, and American officials redirected their attention to Mexico. From 1985 onwards, US operations in Mexico became more aggressive, following the kidnap, torture and murder of a DEA agent by the Guadalajara cartel. With the cold war receding, drugs replaced communism as the enemy No 1 of the American people.

The Americans did not find the Mexican authorities the most co-operative of partners in the “war on drugs”. By the 80s and 90s, writes the sociologist Luis Alejandro Astorga Almanza, “it was practically impossible for society to ignore the unbreakable links between police and traffickers”. Particularly in states such as Tamaulipas, cops would moonlight as traffickers – and traffickers as cops – with the tacit blessing of local authorities and elites. “Various governmental structures seem to have been born captured by the illicit interests of their own creators,” writes Carlos Antonio Flores Peréz, a social anthropologist who studies the institutional protection of the drug trade. US army intelligence cables from the 80s and early 90s reveal that American officials were fully aware that all over Mexico, officials, politicians and state and federal police were in on the take.

In April 1989, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the former police officer who founded the infamous Guadalajara cartel, was arrested, but like Escobar, he continued to run his cartel from prison. That year, his most powerful lieutenants – one of whom was a young Guzmán – assembled in Acapulco and were each assigned a territory. El Chapo and El Mayo took the Pacific coast. This kingmaker moment ushered in a new era, and preceded yet another big shift. Instead of continuing to accept cash from weakened Colombian suppliers, Mexican narcos began demanding payment in cocaine so they could go into business on their own. Before long, they went from being couriers to distributors, which was far more profitable, and overtook their former employers as the world’s biggest traffickers.

While agreements between cartels and Mexican authorities had previously kept violence between the two at bay, by the late 80s these relationships were strained. With the US putting more pressure on the Mexican government to target traffickers, the old arrangements dissolved. Under these new circumstances, violence became common among gangs, writes Sinaloan historian Froylán Enciso, and “a way of confronting the government”.

Still, it rarely spilled into public view. So the country was stunned when in May 1993, a Mexican cardinal was killed in a shootout between the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels at Guadalajara airport. Although it was later discovered that Tijuana sicarios had mistaken the cardinal’s car for Guzmán’s – they were retaliating for a Sinaloa attack that killed nine Tijuana members – he was initially blamed. A nationwide manhunt was called, and with Guzmán splashed all over the papers, he became a household name in Mexico.

In June 1993, he was captured in Guatemala, extradited to Mexico and later sentenced to 20 years in jail for drug trafficking and murder. But for the next eight years, until he escaped in 2001 – allegedly hidden in a laundry cart pushed by a guard – Guzmán, like Félix Gallardo before him, continued to run his business from jail without any difficulties.

In the early 2000s, after Guzmán’s first escape from jail, Sinaloa began to expand. The organisation moved into the markets for meth and fentanyl and, as opioid addiction gained momentum in the US, Guzmán approached it like a shrewd businessman. According to Jack Riley, the former DEA head in Chicago, between 2010 and 2014, the cartel “increased the flow of Colombian and Mexican heroin because [Guzmán] saw the prescription drug problem taking over”.

While this pattern played out across the US, Sinaloa’s power and logistical strength were concentrated in Chicago, the main hub from which they distributed drugs around the country. Cartel operations were so well organised, said Riley, that “you could hit a house with 50 kilos of heroin in it, and two doors down you could hit a house with $5m in it, and neither of the people running the houses even knew the other existed”.

Even as Sinaloa grew, Mexico was relatively peaceful. From the 1990s until 2006, Mexico’s homicide rate fell by nearly half, reaching the lowest levels in its history. Then, in late 2006, everything changed. Just over a week after the conservative Felipe Calderón took office, following a bitterly controversial election that he won by a margin of just 0.6%, he declared an internal war on drugs, sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán. To his critics, this new war on drugs looked like a bid to divert attention from accusations of election fraud.

Calderón’s announcement initiated what would become one of the deadliest periods in Mexican history. With billions in funding from the US, Calderón pursued his own version of the kingpin strategy, deploying the military to fight cartels and targeting their leaders. During his six-year tenure, 25 of Mexico’s “most wanted” – two-thirds of the entire list – were arrested or killed. As cartels pushed back, extortion and kidnappings spiked, and the number of homicides reached an average of 20,000 a year. “In this new atmosphere of fear,” wrote novelist Juan Villoro in an essay about the era, “10,000 companies offer security services and 3,000 people have had chips inserted under their skin so they can be located if they’re kidnapped”.

Despite this violence, Sinaloa seemed to receive less attention from the authorities than other cartels. An investigation by the US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR) reported that between December 2006 and May 2010, Sinaloa members were arrested at significantly lower rates than those of rival groups. A congressman from Sinaloa also told NPR that the government “has been fighting organised crime in many parts of the republic, but has not touched Sinaloa”. Explanations for this varied from low-level corruption in the armed forces to more elaborate conspiracies involving the government – accusations that Calderón told reporters were “totally unfounded”, naming various Sinaloa members that the government had arrested.

In the next general election, in 2012, the PRI retook power and Peña Nieto became president. Although his administration retreated from the kingpin strategy, in 2014, more than a decade after he had first escaped from prison, Guzmán was recaptured and sent to the maximum-security Altiplano Ffederal prison. The following year, he escaped once again, before he was recaptured for the final time in 2016. “Mission complete,” tweeted Peña Nieto.

After a year of negotiations and intense international pressure, Guzmán was extradited to New York in January 2017. If his capture had any effect on the violence in Mexico, it wasn’t immediately positive: 2017 was the deadliest year in modern Mexican history, with a total of 23,101 homicides. It is not clear exactly how many of these deaths and disappearances were linked to organised crime, but scholars have noted that a culture of impunity certainly contributed to the violence. Less than 2% of homicide cases in Mexico result in indictments. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, the number of people killed since 2006 had risen above 250,000, with a further 31,000 declared missing. Targeting leaders had fractured the cartel landscape, and new gangs were rushing in to fill the gaps.

Drug trafficking and cartel violence affect both the US and Mexico, but when it comes to addressing them, the US government has typically strongarmed Mexico into following its lead. Long before the overt bullying of the Trump administration, American officials were known to pay little heed to Mexican sovereignty. Yet even when US violations of that sovereignty pertained to the trial, they were rarely discussed in court.

One notable example was the “Fast and Furious” scandal, which the judge in Guzmán’s trial explicitly barred from mention on the grounds that it would confuse the jury. In this staggeringly ill-advised scheme, US law enforcement agents encouraged gun dealers in Arizona to sell to traffickers believed to be connected to the Mexican cartels, in order to track the weapons and see where they ended up. The first part of this plan succeeded. Between 2009 and 2011, more than 2,000 weapons were purchased in the “gunwalking” operation, and it erupted into the news when a border agent was killed with one. A congressional review later revealed that “ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives] leadership knew that Fast and Furious weapons were heading to the Sinaloa cartel, and Attorney General [Eric] Holder was sent several memos in 2010 notifying him that the Sinaloa cartel was buying them”. An estimated 150 injuries and homicides resulted from the programme, and one of the weapons, a Barrett .50-calibre rifle, was found in Guzmán’s hideout after he was last captured.

Even in less dramatic instances, the “business as usual” of international law enforcement is fraught. Writing for El Proceso, J Jesús Esquivel described the Guzmán trial as having exposed “betrayals, corruption, lies and regular violations of Mexican sovereignty by DEA agents”. Esquivel also zeroed in on cooperating witness deals that the justice department offered to certain traffickers, including Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of El Mayo and Sinaloa’s heir apparent. “El Vicentillo” was one of the trial’s most anticipated witnesses. He was flown in from Chicago, where he had yet to be sentenced on his own trafficking charges, and took the stand in dark blue prison clothes. In a five-hour testimony that the New York Times described as a spectacular betrayal of his father and birthright, Zambada Niebla gave a detailed insider account of cartel workings, describing how the organisation spent at least $1m a month on bribes to police and politicians, and detailing a failed plot to use a government petrol tanker to transport South American cocaine to Mexico.

For taking the stand against his “compadre”, as he politely referred to Guzmán, the 44-year-old was promised a shorter sentence and a possible path to US citizenship. Others were given similar offers. The Cifuentes brothers, who sent tonnes of drugs to cities all over the US, may serve less than 15 years for their cooperation. Even Chupeta, the Colombian trafficker who confessed to having ordered the killings of 150 people – and to having personally shot one man in the face – may be free in 10-15 years for his testimony.

In his plea agreement, Zambada Niebla also agreed to forfeit $1.37bn (yes, billion) to the US government, although it is highly unlikely any money will actually change hands. Since narcos don’t purchase property or open bank accounts in their own names, it can be difficult to locate assets, and if the money is in Mexico, US authorities rarely bother to track it down. Of course, there is no public information about how many narcos are in witness protection, or whether those living under assumed identities have managed to recoup some of their former fortunes. But it is not far-fetched to assume this could happen: on 30 May, a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Vicentillo to 15 years in prison. With time served, this leaves him with five years to go, which may be further reduced for good behaviour.

Outside the courtroom, away from the trial, the US-Mexico relationship is also defined by a kind of mutual obliviousness on the part of each country’s citizens. David Brooks, the Jornada reporter, told me there is still “mass ignorance about what’s happening next door”. In Mexico, he observed, Trump coming to power “reinforced every stereotype of America for the past hundred years”. At the same time, while there are 35 million Mexicans in the US, Americans are generally ignorant of what’s happening below the border. One thing that has gone notably unnoticed, according to Brooks, is the victory of left populist López Obrador. Since he took office in December 2018, Mexico has entered “a moment of potential transformation”, which, if the new president follows through on his promises, could reshape the way Mexico deals with drug trafficking.

A month after the verdict, I met journalist Ioan Grillo in the middle-class area of Roma in Mexico City, several blocks from the house where Alfonso Cuarón had shot his Oscar-winning film, and next to a Sinaloan seafood restaurant. Grillo had recently written an opinion piece rejecting the idea that Guzmán’s conviction was a victory in the war on drugs. “To bring a real sense of justice, you’d need something like a war crimes tribunal,” he observed. Grillo was building on a point that had been made repeatedly by members of the Mexican press at the trial – the case did not seem not to acknowledge how the war on drugs led to thousands of deaths and profoundly altered Mexican society.

There were mixed feelings in Mexico, Grillo added – not about whether Guzmán should go to jail, but about what justice should look like, what closure his conviction could offer and what the whole trial ultimately meant. This was the biggest trial in a drug war that has lasted more than a decade, and it didn’t even take place in Mexico. No actionable evidence against any officials had emerged, and Grillo said most Mexicans were not particularly surprised to hear any of the corruption allegations that the case brought to the surface.

El Chapo’s capture did not have any impact on drug trafficking or consumption, and there is no reason to think his sentence will, either. In 2018, a DEA report found that drug overdoses in the US had hit record highs, and that cocaine and heroin use was on the rise. In Mexico, where drug use has historically been very low, the numbers are steadily climbing: in 2016, 9.9% of the population said they had tried illegal drugs, up from 4.1% in 2002. Moreover, under the leadership of El Mayo and Guzmán’s sons, Iván and Alfredo, Sinaloa has continued to operate. Just as the trial was ending, Arizona officials announced the largest fentanyl seizure in history from a truck coming from Sinaloa territory; and, in mid-April, a presidential candidate in Guatemala was arrested for accepting a bribe from the Sinaloa cartel in exchange for appointing their people to high-ranking government positions.

What is changing in Mexico is the nature of violence. Kate Linthicum, the Mexico City bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times, says that in the past several years she has watched violence become more localised in small gangs and contract criminals with shifting affiliations. This has corresponded with a rise in narcomenudeo, small-scale street trafficking and other forms of crime, including petrol theft. Because Mexico’s petrol industry is nationalised, the robberies cost the government more than $3bn a year. Since López Obrador made it one of his signature issues, petrol theft has become a front-page staple. The thieves are usually associated with local gangs or cartels, and are often assisted by Mexican Petroleum employees. At the beginning of January, López Obrador shut off Mexican Petroleum pipelines to stop smuggling, causing a national shortage that lasted for days. This enraged petrol cartels, but burnished his popularity: a national poll found that more than 80% of Mexicans approved of the move.

It is clear the public wants reform, but the question is whether López Obrador will be able to do anything about the corruption that has for so long hobbled the state, including parts of his own administration. Three days after Guzmán’s sentencing, López Obrador visited Badiraguato, the kingpin’s hometown. Guzmán is by no means a popular figure in Mexico, but in Sinaloa, one of the country’s most dangerous regions, T-shirts with his face on them are sold in markets and he is widely regarded as a local hero. In a state where the federal government is largely absent, El Chapo is credited (without any evidence) with building roads and providing social services. After he was apprehended for the second time in 2014, hundreds of people turned out to demand his release.

During his visit, López Obrador promised jobs to the town’s young people and vowed to make sure that they would not be obliged “to take antisocial paths”. That was four months ago. The jobs haven’t yet materialised, but it was the first time residents could recall a president visiting the region.

27,Dr John obituary,Adam Sweeting,"Wherever musicians gathered, Dr John, who has died aged 77, was revered as songwriter, singer, arranger and pianist. He became closely identified with the rich musical roots of his native New Orleans and as well as his mastery of the Crescent City’s various musical forms (which included blues, jazz, funk, boogie-woogie and rock’n’roll) he was steeped in its mysterious voodoo culture and folklore.

He began to develop a cult following with the release of his first major-label album, Gris-Gris (1968), a startling brew of voodoo funk and strange incantations, epitomised by the eerie eight-minute mantra I Walk on Guilded Splinters. Nobody had heard anything like it, including his label boss, Ahmet Ertegun. “Ahmet asked me: ‘What is this record you gave me … Why didn’t you give me a record that we could sell?’” Dr John recalled. He took the album on tour with a show resembling a bayou magic act, decking himself out in outlandish feathers, witch-doctor robes and headdresses. For a time the act also featured a man calling himself Prince Kiyama, who would bite the heads off live chickens onstage.

Two follow-up albums to Gris-Gris – Babylon (1969) and Remedies (1970) – began to make him influential friends, including Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger, who both appeared on The Sun, Moon & Herbs (1971), and in 1973 he released the biggest selling album of his career, In the Right Place. Produced by Allen Toussaint and with the Meters as backing band, it reached No 24 on the Billboard album chart and gave him a US Top 10 hit single with Right Place, Wrong Time. It also included Such a Night, which Dr John would perform at the Band’s 1976 farewell concert, filmed by Martin Scorsese as The Last Waltz. He failed to reach such sales heights again, but was widely acclaimed across the rest of his career, and won six Grammys for various albums and singles.

Dr John’s real name was Malcolm John Rebennack, the same as his father. Rebennack Sr ran an appliance shop in the East End of New Orleans, fixing radios and televisions and selling records. “Mac” grew up listening to his father’s hoard of 78s by blues artists such as Big Bill Broonzy and Memphis Minnie, jazz by Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis and King Oliver, and country music from Hank Williams and Roy Rogers. His mother, Dorothy (nee Cronin), who had been a fashion model and made her own clothes and hats, arranged for her baby son to feature in advertisements for Ivory soap in the 1940s.

His family was intensely musical, with numerous aunts, uncles and cousins who were amateur musicians. From a young age Mac attended local gigs and, with his father’s assistance, visited recording sessions at the fabled J&M Studio. It was a meeting with the piano player Professor Longhair when he was 14 that persuaded him to pursue a musical career, and he began performing at local clubs. When Jesuit high school told him he must choose between schooling and music, he picked the latter. Proficient on piano and guitar, at 15 he began playing on recording sessions and accompanied artists such as Art Neville, Toussaint and Joe Tex. By 16 he had started producing tracks and was hired as an artists and repertoire man by Johnny Vincent at Ace Records.

In 1960 he was involved in a fight when playing a show in Jackson, Mississippi, and had the ring finger of his left hand almost shot off. He eventually recovered the use of the finger, but it affected his guitar playing and caused him to concentrate on the piano. Working in the New Orleans clubs, he became embroiled in the criminal underworld of drugs and prostitution, and acquired a heroin addiction while dealing drugs himself.

After completing a two-year jail sentence in Fort Worth, Texas, for drug possession in 1965, he moved to Los Angeles and soon was in great demand as a studio session musician. He played on countless tracks for the producer Phil Spector for artists including the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers, worked with Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack, recorded with Bob Dylan and Doug Sahm and played with Frank Zappa, until Zappa sacked him for using drugs.

Gris-Gris was recorded on studio time borrowed from Sonny & Cher, with whom he had been working in Los Angeles and who had helped him secure a deal with Atco records. Produced by Harold Battiste, another New Orleans native transplanted to the West Coast, it marked the first appearance of Rebennack’s pseudonym Dr John Creaux, alias Dr John the Night Tripper.

After The Sun, Moon & Herbs he brought out the album Dr John’s Gumbo (1972), conceived as a tribute to New Orleans music, particularly the compositions of Professor Longhair. Following the positive reaction to In the Right Place in 1973, his next album, Desitively Bonnaroo (1974), was much less successful and it proved to be his last album with Atco. He moved to United Artists for the live album Hollywood Be Thy Name (1975), which was also received unenthusiastically.

From the mid-70s onwards Dr John began a long partnership with the songwriter Doc Pomus that led to songs for his albums City Lights and Tango Palace (both 1979). He then made the solo piano album Dr John Plays Mac Rebennack (1981), a virtuosic showcase of his keyboard skills, and repeated the feat with The Brightest Smile in Town (1983). In 1989, the year he signed to Warner Bros and finally put his heroin addiction behind him, he released In a Sentimental Mood, a sleekly-produced collection of standards including Makin’ Whoopee, a duet with Rickie Lee Jones that earned the pair a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance. He won another Grammy for his second Warners album Goin’ Back to New Orleans (1992), this time for best traditional blues album.

In 1994 he published his autobiography, Under a Hoodoo Moon: The Life of The Night Tripper (co-written with Jack Rummel), a lurid memoir of his musical life in New Orleans that did not shy away from details about drugs, violence, prostitution and the dark side of the music industry. Nonetheless he was beginning to assume the aura of a respected senior citizen, winning a third Grammy in 1996 for the track SRV Shuffle from the album A Tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a fourth in 2000 for his duet with BB King on Is You Is Or Is You Ain’t My Baby. Duke Elegant (2000) comprised John’s takes on favourite Duke Ellington pieces, while Mercernary (2006) was his tribute to another classic songwriter, Johnny Mercer.

The obliteration of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 spurred Dr John to release the fundraising EP Sippiana Hericane, and then City That Care Forgot (2008), an album-length tribute to his grievously wounded home town. It won him Grammy number five, in the best contemporary blues album category, and in 2013 Locked Down brought him a sixth for best blues album. New Orleans was on his mind once again when he made Ske-Dat-De-Dat: Spirit of Satch (2014), a homage to Armstrong, the city’s founding father of jazz.

Dr John performed or recorded with innumerable other artists, including the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Levon Helm, Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band, Harry Connick Jr and Gregg Allman. He also appeared on the all-star charity version of Lou Reed’s Perfect Day in 1997. Among memorable covers of his own songs were versions of I Walk On Guilded Splinters by Cher and then Paul Weller, and Right Place Wrong Time by Tom Jones. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.

He is survived by his wife, Lorraine Sherman, and their daughters, Tara and Jennifer, by another daughter, Karla, from his marriage to Lydia Crow, which ended in divorce in 1995, and by his sister, Barbara.

28,"Dr John, legendary genre-bending New Orleans musician, dies aged 77",Associated Press,"Family thanks ‘all who have shared his unique musical journey’ after Rock & Roll Hall of Famer suffers heart attack

Dr John, the New Orleans musician who blended black and white musical styles with a hoodoo-infused stage persona and gravelly bayou drawl, died Thursday, his family said. He was 77.

In a statement released through his publicist, the family said Dr John, who was born Mac Rebennack, died “toward the break of day” of a heart attack. They did not say where he died or give other details. He had not been seen in public much since late 2017, when he canceled several gigs. He had been resting at his New Orleans area home, publicist Karen Beninato said last year in an interview.

Memorial arrangements were being planned. “The family thanks all whom have shared his unique musical journey, and requests privacy at this time,” the statement said.

The artist’s spooky 1968 debut, Gris-Gris, combined rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and startled listeners with its sinister implications of other-worldly magic. He later had a Top 10 hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, collaborated with numerous top-tier rockers, won multiple Grammy awards and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

A white man who found a home among black New Orleans musicians, he first entered the music scene alongside his father, who ran a record shop and also fixed the PA systems at New Orleans bars.

As a teenager in the 1950s, he played guitar and keyboards in a string of bands and made the legendary studio of Cosimo Matassa his second home, Rebennack said in his 1994 memoir, Under a Hoodoo Moon.

He got into music full-time after dropping out of high school, became acquainted with drugs and petty crime and lived a fast-paced life. His gigs ranged from strip clubs to auditoriums, roadhouses and chicken shacks.

The ring finger of Rebennack’s left hand was blown off in a shooting incident in 1961 in Jacksonville, Florida.

He blamed Jim Garrison, the JFK conspiracy theorist and a tough-on-crime New Orleans district attorney, for driving him out of his beloved city in the early 1960s. Garrison went after prostitutes, bars and all-night music venues.

The underworld sweep put Rebennack in prison. At that time, he was a respected session musician who had played on classic recordings by R&B mainstays like Professor Longhair and Irma Thomas. He was also addicted to heroin. After his release from federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas, at age 24, Rebennack joined his friend and mentor Harold Battiste, who had left New Orleans, to make music in Los Angeles.

Rebennack, who had long had a fascination with occult mysticism and voodoo, told Battiste about creating a musical personality out of Dr John, a male version of Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen.

In his memoir, Rebennack said, he drew inspiration from New Orleans folklore about a root doctor who flourished in the mid-1800s.

Battiste, in a 2005 interview, recalled: “It was really done sort of tongue-in-cheek.”

But Dr John was born and Rebennack got his first personal recordings done in what became Gris-Gris, a 1967 classic of underground American music.

In the years that followed, he played with the Grateful Dead, appeared with the Band in the director Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz documentary, jammed on the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street album and collaborated with countless others, among them Earl King, Van Morrison and James Booker.

29,Is the new James Bond film cursed – or just losing the plot?,Andrew Pulver,"Explosions, injuries, rewrites … Bond 25 seems beset by crisis. The result of intense media scrutiny, or a sign that the series is struggling to find a new direction?

The new Bond film is tearing the roof off – literally, it would seem. Reports emerged this week from Pinewood Studios that an explosion on the film’s set on Tuesday destroyed part of a sound-stage roof and tore off large chunks of exterior panelling, as well as causing a “minor injury” to a crew member.

The explosion is the latest setback to affect production of the film known as Bond 25, the 25th and latest in the hugely profitable series based on Ian Fleming’s books that began in 1962 and has earned well over $2bn worldwide. The UK’s Health and Safety Executive has announced it is to make inquiries into the incident, though it as yet has stopped short of a full investigation.

Bond 25 has been hit with a series of problems that, though in some ways not unusual for a production of its scale, are causing repeated delays and suggest a sense of crisis is enveloping it, and there is even talk of a “curse”. Shooting had to be cancelled after lead actor Daniel Craig injured his ankle in May and needed surgery that put him out of action for a fortnight. Producers have hired multiple writers to rework the script – most eyecatchingly, Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, only the second woman to receive a writing credit on a Bond film, who has called for the series to “evolve” and “treat women properly”. And a recent launch event in April, streamed live on Facebook from Jamaica, proved a disappointment, with lead producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson unable to confirm the title of the film, due to be released in less than a year’s time, in April 2020.

Arguably the most significant setback, however, occurred in August last year, when the original director, Danny Boyle, abruptly left the project over “creative differences”, meaning Broccoli and Wilson had to start again almost from scratch, with no way to meet the original planned release date of autumn 2019. A month later, Cary Fukunaga was announced as Boyle’s replacement.

Part of the difficulties the Bond film is facing is a result of its attempts to overhaul and reposition a series that – despite the strength of its traditionalist appeal – looks in danger of becoming rapidly outdated in the current climate. “There’s no doubt that the 007 franchise needs to make a big effort to be fresh and current in the age of Time’s Up,” says Anna Smith, chair of the London Film Critics’ Circle and host of the Girls on Film podcast.

“Though Bond films are hardly woke, representation has been improving over the years, though I think there is still a long way to go when it comes to female characters – the cavalier treatment of Monica Bellucci in Spectre springs to mind. I’m excited to see what Phoebe Waller-Bridge does with the script, and if it takes time to get that right, I’m ready to wait.”

Crisis has never seemed far away in the Craig era, with the actor repeatedly sustaining injuries since taking on the role, including losing two teeth in a fight scene in Casino Royale and having a fingertip sliced off during Quantum of Solace. External factors have also contributed: the 2007-08 writers strike hampered the production of Quantum of Solace, with Craig admitting he rewrote scenes with director Marc Forster, and a financial crisis at parent studio MGM in 2010 meant extensive delays before Skyfall could get under way.

However, the extraordinary box office success of Skyfall and its follow-up, Spectre – the second and third highest-grossing films of all time in the UK – has meant that the series has had to cater to growing fan demands and wider scrutiny in the press and social media.

Smith says: “The challenge will be balancing political correctness with reassuring their core audience that James Bond is still a traditionally ‘masculine’ man and avoiding a backlash. Trolls are very quick to panic about their favourite franchises going feminist – often just based on a trailer. But I hope there are many other Bond fans who would welcome further progress.”","Explosions, injuries, rewrites … Bond 25 seems beset by crisis.

30,Theresa May: a political obituary in five charts,Cath Levett,"Time

When Tony Blair relinquished power in 2007, there was speculation that he had wanted to surpass the term served by Margaret Thatcher. In turn, Theresa May finally announced a departure date which guaranteed her a longer record of service than Gordon Brown. Like Brown, she will remain prime minister while others in Westminster choose her successor.

Power

Theresa May’s greatest gamble as prime minister was calling an election in 2017 which she hoped would shore up her then meagre parliamentary majority and give her a stronger mandate to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with the EU. In fact it left her reliant on the DUP to pass budgets. When the Northern Irish unionists then withdrew their support on Brexit because of fears that the “backstop” would mean a customs border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, May went on to suffer some of the worst parliamentary defeats on record. Both pro- and anti-Europeans in her own party joined the opposition in repeatedly voting down her withdrawal agreement. (For history buffs: the Campbell case vote was a defeat for the Labour government of the time over a suppressed inquiry into a communist journalist.)

People

May’s government was always an uneasy coalition of Brexiters – to whom she gave all the Brexit-related jobs – and remainers or pro-Europeans, most notably Philip Hammond, the chancellor. So it was no surprise that the tensions would lead to resignations on both sides as the pendulum of the negotiations swung from hard to soft. But even without that, May’s workforce was particularly unreliable; Brexiter Priti Patel was forced out of the Department for International Development over unorthodox meetings with the Israeli military, and two close May allies, Damian Green and Michael Fallon, resigned over allegations of inappropriate sexual advances.

Money

The sterling exchange rate closely tracked the market’s reaction to May’s Brexit approach over her three years in office. When she signalled a harder stance, as with her Lancaster House speech ruling out a customs union, the value of the pound fell. When agreement with the EU seemed near, or parliament forcefully rejected no-deal, the pound rose. Although Donald Trump’s combative trade policies and an Italian budget crisis meant that the dollar and the euro were also volatile, the pound rarely moved significantly unless nudged by Brexit developments.

Respect

May’s promise at the beginning of her term was to serve all Britons, but a series of domestic crises severely undermined the impression she set out to give. First the tragedy of Grenfell Tower, and then the scandal over the treatment of the Windrush generation combined with Brexit and continuing austerity to keep May’s approval ratings low. In the final months, the increasing evidence of powerlessness brought it crashing down.","TimeWhen Tony Blair relinquished power in 2007, there was speculation that he had wanted to surpass the term served by Margaret Thatcher.

33,'I feel hopeful': New Zealanders cautiously welcome Wellbeing Budget,Eleanor Ainge Roy,"Praise for spending on mental health and child wellbeing is tempered with concerns that the economic plan fails to address root causes of inequality

Pensioner Garry Harvey lived in Australia for decades before returning home to a tidy council flat in South Dunedin earlier this year. The socio-economically deprived suburb at the bottom of New Zealand’s South Island is in the crosshairs of the nation’s first-ever “wellbeing budget”, a radical economic plan for the country devised by Jacinda Ardern to improve the lives of the poorest citizens.

For the first time the annual budget puts social wellbeing indicators ahead of GDP when it comes to spending decisions. From now on, the health of New Zealand will not be measured by growth alone, but instead by the overall wellbeing and prosperity of its nearly 5 million people.

It is a tall order. New Zealand has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD, the fourth highest rate of family violence and diseases of poverty seen no-where else in the developed world.

Harvey, 67, a gruff but loquacious former seaman, hopes the wellbeing budget will transform his suburb, where many locals battle mental health issues and crime is prevalent. He returned to New Zealand from Australia because of rising racism, and says his native country is now more “equitable” than its neighbour across the Tasman Sea.

“It was a good start, because you can’t get all your Christmas crackers in one day,” he says.

“I felt hopeful. There is so much more money for mental health, which is good as gold. And there is a big new hospital. We’re all in the one canoe, the big New Zealand waka [canoe], and we’ve all got to work together.”

When finance minister Grant Robertson announced the budget last week he said it would make New Zealand “both a great place to make a living, and a great place to make a life.”

Vicky Freeman, 40, who appeared on the front of the budget document with her daughter Ruby-Jean, says the priorities of the budget are “solid”; a record NZ$1.9bn for mental health, NZ$1bn for child wellness, and a record NZ$320m to combat domestic and family violence.

Despite gracing the cover of the budget, Freeman and her daughter no longer live in New Zealand, having relocated to Australia in December after the high-cost of living in the country’s largest city of Auckland proved too much.

“We do need help for people that are mentally ill and committing suicide. We need to help the children, we need to bring up Kiwi children better. I really hope this makes a difference in people’s lives. I hope they’re not just saying stuff and won’t follow through,” Freeman says.

‘We need to stop the harm from happening’

But the praise has not been universal. At Child Poverty Action Group, which campaigns on behalf of more than a quarter of New Zealand children who live in income poverty, there was disappointment.

Spokeswoman Jeni Cartwright described the budget’s mental health focus as “an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff”; that instead of tackling entrenched poverty issues in New Zealand, it was throwing money at the end result of long-term, inter-generational deprivation.

“We were looking for significant improvement to people’s incomes, and we didn’t see that,” says Cartwright.

“Rather that thinking about how to allay the harm [of poverty], we need to stop the harm from happening.”

While Harvey remains “hopeful” about the government’s commitment to helping the country’s most vulnerable people, he remains concerned that structural change – such as the introduction of a capital gains tax – have been ruled out by Ardern.

“I agree with putting money into a wellbeing budget but they are periphery things,” says Harvey. “This country is run by the rich to exploit the poor and lets face it, and say it, and plan for it.”

Robertson admits inter-generational transformation will take decades, but the building blocks of changing New Zealanders lives from the bottom up have now been put in place.

“Our North Star is now reflective of a broader set of values,” he says.

“It’s a work in progress, but the constant refrain we have heard [from New Zealanders] is if we have this so-called rockstar economy how is it that the OECD says we have the worst homelessness? How is it that we can’t swim in most of the rivers and lakes of New Zealand in the summertime? And how is it child poverty has grown to the extent it has?

“The answer, in my view, is that the government wasn’t sufficiently valuing those things … if it wasn’t being valued it wasn’t being measured. And if it wasn’t being measured it wasn’t being done.”","For the first time the annual budget puts social wellbeing indicators ahead of GDP when it comes to spending decisions.

34,Experience: I was hospitalised with a sex headache,Lisa Henderson,"My partner’s head was between my legs when I felt a splitting pain at the base of my skull. It was as if someone was trying to crack it open with a teaspoon – as if it was a boiled egg about to spill its yolk. At 24 years old, I had chalked up my fair share of experience, but this was a new sensation at the height of orgasm. Even so, it was 3am and neither the worry nor the pain stopped me from falling asleep.

The next morning, the pain was still there. It had dulled to an unpleasant throb. At the time, in 2017, I was between jobs, so I put it down to a stress-induced headache, but I booked an appointment with my GP just in case. I told the doctor about the previous night’s events and showed her where the pain was. Apparently, it is not uncommon for pressure to build up in the blood vessels leading to the brain during sex – but, on rare occasions, this can cause a berry aneurysm to burst, leading to a dangerous bleed. She told me this in a tone of alarm I had rarely heard from a doctor, then faxed the Royal Free hospital in London to let them know I would be coming in immediately.

I felt surprisingly calm, and made the obligatory calls to my parents and my partner to let them know what was happening. This turned out to be a huge mistake.

I set up camp in a corner of A&E and – grateful that I had a book with me – whipped out Hunter S Thompson’s Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. I remember getting to the line “In a closed society where everybody’s guilty, the only crime is getting caught” because of what happened next. To my horror, my father rushed in, eyes red and watery. I had been there less than two hours, which meant he must have cancelled an afternoon of teaching his driving students in Bedfordshire and floored it along the motorway without warning me.

I should have focused on reassuring him, but my mind was racing – how to get my story straight? I ended up telling him the doctors thought there had been a build-up of pressure in my head caused by strenuous exercise. For most of the next 15 hours, I succeeded in keeping him in the dark. I rebuffed every attempt he made to accompany me to blood tests, for fear a medic would casually drop in the sex part of the story.

Eventually, I was called for an MRI scan and wheeled to a room where my father was waiting. Hours passed. There was talk of a lumbar puncture and a weekend stay. It was only then, when the prospect of a needle in my spine entered my mind, that fear overtook embarrassment.

Finally, a senior doctor appeared, flanked by two juniors. He started to speak. I blurted out: “Stop!” “Sorry,” I went on, “it’s just there might be some things in that report my dad doesn’t know.” I turned to my father and apologetically asked him to leave the room. As he walked out, I saw a familiar expression on his face – that quiet, what-have-you-done-now? parental rage. The doctors looked uncomfortable, but continued as if nothing had happened. “We’re pretty sure you don’t have a bleed to the brain now,” the senior doctor said. “It seems it’s just a sex headache.” I didn’t say anything. It sounded like a joke and I was waiting for the punchline.

“As sexual excitement increases, pressure can build up, causing a dull pain in the back of your head,” the doctor explained. He told me I wouldn’t necessarily get sex headaches every time I orgasmed, but warned that the problem could last a while. “If so, you need to take painkillers beforehand.” The doctors left and my father walked in. “Are you pregnant?” he demanded. I reminded him that I came out years ago.

There is no easy way to tell your father that he has spent 17 hours in a hospital because you had been having earth-shattering sex. We left quietly and he offered to take me back to my parents’ house, but I couldn’t face the humiliation of telling my mother the story, too. I assume he relayed the details, but she has never mentioned it.

After my father went home, I called my partner to let her know I was OK. She was positively gleeful at the diagnosis. “Hold on, our sex almost blew your mind?” The headaches lasted a few months. And while, 18 months later, we are still having mindblowing sex, I haven’t had to return to the emergency room.

35,The Peterborough result spells out the dangers the next Tory leader will face | Katy Balls,Katy Balls,"The Peterborough byelection result is bad news for both the Brexit party and the Conservatives. The vote – triggered after former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya was ousted under recall rules following her conviction for lying over a speeding offence – had been touted as a perfect opportunity for Nigel Farage’s newly formed party to build on their success in the European elections and prove they’re a force to be reckoned with in Westminster.

In the end, they fell short – with Labour retaining the seat, their candidate Lisa Forbes beat the Brexit party candidate Mike Greene by 683 votes. Brexit party officials put their narrow defeat down to a lack of data and Labour having more time to prepare. The number of votes the party received is impressive for a new party but given the high expectations following the European elections the overall sense is one of disappointment. The fact that they failed to clinch the seat is a reminder of the difficulty smaller parties face in a first-past-the-post general election system. It’s something Farage knows well. He himself has sought Westminster election seven times in the past 25 years without success.

Exit May. Now begins a battle for the soul of our democracy | Gaby Hinsliff Read more

But Farage doesn’t even need to win elections with the Brexit party to cause the Tories serious damage. In the Peterborough byelection, the Conservative party came in third – at 7,243 votes to the Brexit party’s 9,801. This seat has long been a Labour/Tory marginal – one the Conservatives held from 2005 to 2017 when Labour narrowly took it back in the snap election. Now the Tories are struggling to stay in contention.

If the UK has not left the EU by the time of the next general election, Farage has vowed that the Brexit party will field candidates and destroy the two-party system. Should he fail to go the whole hog, the Brexit party need only attract a couple of thousand votes in Labour/Tory marginals to successfully eat into the Conservative vote and allow Labour to come out on top.

This is a scenario that has worried Tory MPs in leave areas ever since the Brexit party launched. Analysis by Electoral Calculus said that if a general election were called the Tories would lose 59 seats and Labour would become the largest party in the Commons. This is in part because in areas such as Walsall North – a heavily leave area which the Tories won from Labour in 2017 – the Brexit party would take such a chunk out of the Conservative vote that Labour would waltz through the middle. The Peterborough byelection result will only increase such fears.

So, how will the Conservative party respond? An outright victory for the Brexit party in Peterborough would have been heralded as a win for Boris Johnson in the leadership contest, with Tory MPs most likely to turn to him to – as he told MPs on Tuesday – put “Farage back in his box”. A narrow win for Labour doesn’t take away the threat of the Brexit party – but it does allow other candidates space to put forward their own pitches for tackling the Brexit party threat.

When I chaired the One Nation Tory caucus hustings on Tuesday night, Sajid Javid got one of the loudest cheers of the night when he declared that the Tories would not beat Farage by becoming the Brexit party. Expect Javid and other candidates like Matt Hancock to argue that this shows the party does not need to match Farage’s party wholesale.

Quick guide Tory leadership contenders Show Hide Michael Gove The environment secretary is to pitch himself as a “unity candidate” capable of attracting leavers and remainers, as he formally declared his candidacy saying: “I believe that I’m ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist party, ready to deliver Brexit and ready to lead this great country.” But robust Brexiters in particular dislike the fact that he stayed loyal even in the final days of the crumbling May regime. Sam Gyimah The former universities minister is calling for a 'final say on the Brexit deal' as the only way to break the parliamentary deadlock. Gyimah is the only candidate offering a second referendum on Brexit, saying 'There is a wide range of candidates out there but there is a very narrow set of views on Brexit being discussed'. Matt Hancock The health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on, the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of being apparently competent and broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one. A concerted effort would probably require an image consultant. Mark Harper The former immigration minister and chief whip was behind the controversial 'go-home' vans when working under Theresa May at the Home Office. He resigned as immigration minister in 2014after it emerged he was employing a cleaner who did not have permission to work in the UK. He later served as David Cameron’s chief whip. But he has not served in Theresa May’s government and has, therefore, sought to cast himself as the candidate who offers 'fresh thinking. Jeremy Hunt Fears that the foreign secretary would be another overly woolly compromise choice were hardly assuaged when after a set-piece speech he seemed unable to outline why his brand of Conservatism might appeal to voters. Hunt has been backed by Liam Fox. Sajid Javid The home secretary still has the same weaknesses: he is an uninspiring speaker and some worry he is too fond of headline-grabbing, illiberal political gestures. But he is almost as ubiquitous as Liz Truss, and clearly believes this is his time. Boris Johnson The out-and-out favourite, so popular with the Tory grassroots that it would be hard for MPs to not make Johnson one of the final two. He has been relatively quiet recently, beyond his regular Telegraph column, but this is very deliberate. Andrea Leadsom The former House of Commons leader, who left Theresa May as the last candidate standing when she pulled out of the previous leadership race in 2016, has decided to have another tilt at the top job, saying she has the “experience and confidence” to “lead this country into a brighter future”. But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider. Esther McVey The former work and pensions secretary, who quit last year over May’s Brexit plans, has launched her own in-party campaign group/leadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism, promising to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as diverting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police. Dominic Raab Few things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged with this imageawash with tasteful pastel hues. He formally launched his bid in the Mail on Sunday. Among the more core constituency of Conservative MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official “Ready for Raab” Twitter feed. Rory Stewart The cabinet’s most recent arrival – Mordaunt’s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary – certainly has the necessary ambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism. He's become a social media darling and been endorsed by Ken Clarke, but his reputation as 'Florence of Belgravia' may hinder him. And those not in the running Sir Graham Brady, Penny Mordaunt and James Brokenshire are yet to declare their intentions. Liz Truss and Amber Rudd have ruled themselves out. Among other senior figures not expected to run are Brandon Lewis, Chris Grayling and Philip Hammond. Gavin Williamson’s recent sacking after the Huawei leak inquiry will also surely rule him out as an option this time around. James Cleverly and Kit Malthouse withdrew from the contest.

Given the threat of a Brexit party coming in even second place poses for the Tories, the result will still send ripples through the leadership contest. In order to combat this, every Tory leadership hopeful agrees on the need to avoid a general election until after the UK has left the EU. The hope is that delivering some form of Brexit will be enough to significantly reduce the threat from Farage. However, delivering Brexit with no majority in the Commons and Brussels reluctant to renegotiate is no easy task. When it comes to the leadership contest, there is a new premium on any candidate who is able to convince their colleagues that they are up to the task: delivering Brexit while avoiding an election in the process.

36,Trump's family holiday to UK Disneyland makes for painful viewing | John Crace,John Crace,"Monday

Sometimes I worry I am more psychically connected to Tottenham Hotspur than is healthy. Having done my two events at the Hay festival, I went back to the friends I was staying with to watch the Champions League final. Only to find they didn’t have BT Sport and their internet connection was patchy at best. So I ended up viewing the game on my iPad with a screen that kept buffering and then freezing. Which of course was entirely appropriate, because buffering and freezing appeared to be Spurs’ main game plan. The biggest match in the club’s history, against a team playing well below its best, and Spurs also chose to have a complete off day. Even down to giving away a dodgy penalty inside the first minute. You can’t get more Spursy than that. It almost made me proud. Still, there was one upside. The two friends, Matthew and Terry, who ended up using my tickets kept me updated with photos throughout their trip, from their arrival in Toulouse to their eight-hour car journey to Madrid to their picnic on the beach on the way back. What struck me most was that they were both smiling in every shot. Something I would never have managed. I would have been sick with anxiety before the game and acutely depressed after it. There was no avoiding it. The right two people went to the game. Though it was a little upsetting to realise all my friends almost certainly have a better time without me.

Tuesday

There were plenty of spare seats among the US press corps and there was masses of space for more chairs to be laid out for the British media in the cavernous Durbar Court in the Foreign Office. Yet neither I nor any of the other sketch writers managed to secure accreditation for the Theresa May and Donald Trump press conference. Instead, the night before, we all received a rather sniffy email from No 10 regretting that it was unable to squeeze us in. A cynic might wonder if two of the most powerful leaders in the western world aren’t totally in favour of a free press. So, like everyone else, I was obliged to follow this particular episode of the US president’s family holiday to UK Disneyland on television. It was painful viewing. Not because of the inevitable lies, distortions and embarrassments that have long been priced in to any Trump public appearance. But because of the effect it was clearly having on the prime minister. When May had invited Trump, she expected to have negotiated the UK’s withdrawal from the EU by the time of his arrival and to use his visit to project an image of power. Shoulder to shoulder with the president, negotiating a new trade deal. Instead, she cut a forlorn, diminished figure as she was both patronised and ignored by Trump, who made no secret that he was far more interested in her successor. It was like watching the prime minister vanish before your eyes.

Wednesday

My mother was 20 in June 1944 and had served for two years as a Wren – a member of the Women’s Royal Naval Service - in Portsmouth. When I was growing up, she would frequently tell me how she observed the buildup of troops, ships and military hardware in the days leading up to D-day, and how she went back to her billet each night thinking it would only take one stray German plane to fly over and the whole element of surprise would be lost and the invasion force wiped out. That the secrecy was maintained was always the biggest miracle to her. I’ve found the 75th anniversary commemorations profoundly moving, especially the handful of surviving veterans and letters from the dead. But they’ve also generated some anger, because politicians may talk a good game about the importance of honouring the sacrifices of the wartime generation, but they don’t follow up on it. My father was mentally scarred by his experiences in the war, but was merely told to get on and make the best of it. No one was interested. The war was over, just be grateful to be alive. The horror of what he had been through never left him and he struggled to express his feelings. My mother is now 95 and in a home. She often says she feels like an inconvenience. Remembrance seldom lasts more than a day. It should be an action, not a thought.

Thursday

Even though it’s been more than 30 years since I took any drugs, I still have dreams in which I am using heroin at least two or three times a year, and they never fail to leave me profoundly disturbed. Last night, I had one such dream. Though the characters and location vary each time, the set-up is always identical. I never actually take any heroin. Instead, I have always almost run out of the drug, terrified I am about to go cold turkey and engaged in an invariably futile search for a dealer. All the while trying to avoid meeting anyone I know and feeling a deep sense of guilt and failure that I have relapsed. Each time, I wake up with an acute sense of anxiety, as the dreams are so vivid I’m not immediately sure what’s real and what’s not, and feel unsettled for most of the following day. It’s as if my subconscious will never let me forgive myself or forget, and is determined to make me relive the shame at regular intervals. On Tuesday night, I had the pleasure of interviewing the bestselling US author Michael Pollan at a packed event in Westminster about his new book How to Change Your Mind, a study of the new science of psychedelics. It turns out that under controlled conditions LSD and psilocybin have proved beneficial in the treatment of conditions such as depression, OCD and addiction. Personally, I will be giving this a swerve – my mental health is already rather too fragile and I took enough psychedelics in the late 1970s to put me off for a lifetime – but the evidence Pollan put forward that LSD can help people who are stuck in their lives was compelling. I did wonder whether we should be feeding psychedelics to our politicians to resolve Brexit, an idea that was overwhelmingly endorsed by the audience. At best, it could effect a change of thinking. And if it gave some of them a bad trip, they would at least know how the rest of us are feeling.

Friday

Usually I like to binge-watch TV series, and my wife has to talk me down from squeezing in just one more episode before going to bed. Chernobyl has proved the exception. It is just so brilliant and so devastating that both of us can only take one episode at a time. After an hour’s viewing, we are both physically and mentally exhausted and need a break. I can’t remember any other TV show that has ever had that effect on me, and the script and acting are every bit as superb as many other critics have said. I was 30 at the time of Chernobyl and I can clearly remember feeling first worried and then reassured it had been a minor incident, and that only – only – 40 or so people had died. Over time, I came to realise it had been much more serious, but it’s taken a TV drama to make me aware of the full scale of the disaster. Soviet secrecy somehow managed to survive the collapse of the Soviet Union. Talking of which, old-school communist bloc traditions appear to be back in fashion. In recent years, China has taken a rather commercial approach to its pandas, loaning them out to zoos for $1m (£790,000) a year. But now, panda diplomacy has returned with the news that China’s president, Xi Jinping, has handed over a couple to Moscow zoo as a personal gift to Vladimir Putin. Back to the future. Arguably Ted Heath’s greatest achievement as prime minister was to secure a couple of pandas from Chairman Mao. If Theresa May could nab a pair before 5pm today, she may yet have a legacy.

37,Maradona and Naples created an unearthly and sometimes dark magic. I was there | Ed Vulliamy,Ed Vulliamy,"Sundays would begin and end at a bar called Bollicine – bubbles – behind Piazza Leopardi station in the Fuorigrotta quarter of Naples. It was kept by a man called Enzo Cosenza, who also led choreography and singing in the city’s football stadium. That’s where we spent the time in between, across the span of two years with season tickets, watching Diego Maradona defy the laws of gravity and physics with a football.

I was working in Rome, but commuting from Naples for romantic reasons, and I soon fell in love with Maradona as well. Ahead of Asif Kapadia’s much-anticipated documentary on the Maradona phenomenon, released next week, the talk is once again about Diego. The film turns the pages of a marvellous scrapbook, but doesn’t convey how Maradona and Naples shared a common heartbeat and soul. To understand Maradona in those days was to understand Naples, and vice versa: the same unearthly magic, the same brilliant light, the same maleficient shadows.

Diego Maradona: flight of the enchanter - from the archive, 6 April 1991 Read more

In 1984, SSC Napoli played a stratum below Europe’s soccer powerhouses and wasn’t the obvious destination for a global football star. And this was long before Elena Ferrante and mass tourism: Naples was a place through which visitors hurried to the Amalfi coast, clutching their wallets, often in vain.

Yet it was the perfect place for Maradona: every Neapolitan felt the hand of God in Maradona’s arrival among them. By wresting the city’s first ever championship titles from the hated, hitherto dominant, teams of the rich north, Maradona incarnated the rebellious pride and elan of the poorer south. “Here come the Neapolitans – what a stench! Even the dogs run away,” visiting Milanese fans would sing. “Cholerati! Terremottati!”– cholera-ridden, “earthquaked”. And from our beloved Curva B end of the stadium, led by Cosenza, came the reply: “Mamma, why does my heart beat so? Because I’ve seen Maradona, I’m in love.”

I was in the Curva B the night Italy faced Argentina in the 1990 World Cup semi-final in Naples, when Maradona’s national team shattered the host country’s fairytale. And there was salt in the wound: “Napoli non è Italia” (“Naples isn’t Italy”) Maradona had insisted, urging that the Ultras commit treason and support Argentina. They did, and were never forgiven. But there was logic to the choice; a thread of Parthenopean identity reaching back from the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies to vengeance in the present by the messiah from Buenos Aires.

The synergy between player and city cut still deeper. Naples exists on a faultline and in the shadow of a volcano, in close proximity to the cults of death and after-life, replete with what northern Europeans and Protestants call superstition. “You don’t know what you missed,” read graffiti on a cemetery wall after the second championship in 1990, when celebrations lasted three nights. “How do you know we missed it?” came a retort.

I knew Neapolitans who read cards in earnest, and interpreted dreams with numeric systems. Before the tourists, the canyon-street of peeling stucco called Spaccanapoli was lined with wart-faced marionettes, masks and pulcinelle harlequins, steeped in folklore.

Catholicism in Naples can be richly occult: in the chapel of Sansevero, the marble veil over Christ’s body is so impossibly thin it must have been draped over him and turned to stone by magic, so they say; in a crypt below are the skeletal remains of a couple whose vascular systems are petrified by an 18th-century alchemist’s experiment.

What’s this got to do with Maradona? Everything. Maradona practised sorcery on the pitch; he played voodoo football. Maradona could mind-read and outwit a spellbound opponent’s motive before he knew it himself. No player can be a team, but Maradona’s sixth sense infused those alongside him; his captaincy was seance, as was his communion with Naples. Maradona played pagan football for a pagan city, and that was why it loved him.

Then there was the dark side. Spending half my life in Naples, it was impossible to avoid, and avoid writing about, the Camorra. These were years of sorpasso – overtaking – of Sicily’s Cosa Nostra by the less hierarchical, opportunistic syndicates of what Roberto Saviano later immortalised as “Gomorra”.

I interviewed a man called Pepe who had known Maradona well, and to whom he had confessed: “I’m not a saint, I’m a football player”

Both Maradona’s work and mine became porous – like so much else in Naples – to toxic omnipresence. I wrote exponentially more about the Camorra’s bloodletting and entwinement with a terrifying power machine operated by the Christian Democrat party, while Maradona, in his eagerness to please and be pleased, was ensnared by the mafia, drinking champagne in a cockleshell bath and frequenting a Camorra joint called the Airone piano bar. Himself a boy of the barrio, Maradona’s story was now both inspiration and cautionary tale: he celebrated the fact that exploitation of his trademark in “unofficial merchandise” gave work “to the poor children of Naples” – the mafia as Robin Hood – and willingly accepted the Camorra’s currencies of cocaine and prostitutes. He got them, and they got him, in equal measure.

So on weekdays between watching him play, I found myself at work on Maradona and the Camorra, listening to his voice on police wiretaps. One morning a Camorra madam called Donna Carmela Cinquegrana put her son Cristino on the line for a chat with his football idol, before procuring two prostitutes for the footballer that night. Italian has no word for “privacy”, and in the tatty baroque courtyards and apartment blocks of Naples there is none, whether Maradona craved it or not. Naples adulated but devoured him. I interviewed a man called Pepe who had known Maradona well, and to whom he had confessed: “I’m not a saint, I’m a football player.”

Diego Maradona fell, as Italians say, “dalle stelle alle stalle”, from the stars to the stables.

Having arrived by helicopter into a stadium packed with 75,000 just to greet him, he was now summoned for interview by magistrates and fled Naples ignominiously. The city without Maradona felt, I wrote then, “like a deck of cards stripped of both its joker and its ace”. But Naples adored him too much to feel betrayed; besides, Maradona had shared its vulnerabilities and pain, as well as caused its deliverance.

But Maradona remains in Naples’ heart as he always was: enchanter, saviour, talisman, wizard. His portrait adorns wretched apartment blocks, his maquette figurine is ubiquitous. The city has never really recovered from Maradona since the moment someone wrote, the day after his departure, on a wall in the tumbledown Forcella quarter: “Diego Facci Ancora Sognare” – “Diego, make us dream again”.

38,The Tories are bending parliament’s rules to get their way – like Charles I did | Chris Bryant,Chris Bryant,"Every day seems to bring another sign of the collective emotional breakdown that has seized the body politic. This parliamentary session is now the longest since the 17th century. At the start of the year we had the longest period without an Opposition day (a day where the subjects for discussion are chosen by the opposition) since they were invented. The government has no majority in the Commons, but it has redrawn the rules so that it enjoys a majority on every committee. Even the Speaker has got in on the act, declaring that “forthwith” no longer means forthwith.

So many historic precedents have been broken that it is easy to become inured to the craziness. A common cry around the scaffolded corridors of Westminster is “there is no such thing as normal any more”. So we should just take stock for a brief moment of the latest madness.

Next Tory leader could face immediate confidence vote Read more

Conservative MPs are speculating that a new prime minister not only could, but should, prorogue parliament until 1 November so that Brexit happens automatically. In other words, the government would prevent parliament from sitting so as to get its own way. That is precisely what tyrants and demagogues do the world over.

I hate to get too historical about this, but this is also precisely what Charles I did when parliament refused to give him the money he needed or pass the laws he wanted. There is no difference between forcing a no-deal Brexit through without parliament’s say-so and Charles I illegally levying his ship money or his oxymoronic enforced loan. Charles’s so-called personal rule led inevitably to the civil wars and his shivering on the scaffold. So you would think modern-day Conservatives would recall the strictures of the Bill of Rights which declares that “the pretended power of suspending the laws and dispensing with laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal”.

Would this suggested suspension of parliament be legally possible, though? Amazingly, yes. It’s entirely up to the crown (aka the government) when a parliamentary session starts and finishes, although one wonders whether the Queen might not be rather disturbed by the exercising of such a tyrannical power. The only way parliament could prevent summary prorogation is by passing a new law, which requires – wait for it – the government to provide time for such a new law to get through all its stages in the Commons and Lords.

There’s another outrage in the offing, too. Some government whips have suggested that the summer recess could start on Thursday 18 July and run until 2 September: if the House were to rise before the projected election of the new Conservative leader, events could be engineered so that the new prime minister would not be bothered by parliament for six full weeks – and may not even appear for prime minister’s questions for 43 days. Downing Street subsequently denied that this would happen, saying that Theresa May won’t finally leave until she knows her successor as Tory leader has secured the confidence of the Commons – but she’s no longer in charge of her own destiny, let alone the destiny of the nation.

Exit May. Now begins a battle for the soul of our democracy | Gaby Hinsliff Read more

Regardless, would such a manoeuvre be legally possible? Again, yes. The only thing that might get in the way is if the Speaker allows the recall of parliament – but he can only do so if the government asks him to.

You might of course think that in such times as these a new prime minister would want to address parliament and lay out their plans. A brave new premier would surely welcome a chance to prove that their government has the confidence of the House.

Winston Churchill managed to address the Commons just three days after forming his wartime coalition government in 1940, even though the British Expeditionary Force was facing imminent disaster in France.

Leaving aside new governments created after a general election, the longest a new prime minister has gone without addressing parliament since 1866 is 24 days (when Alec Douglas-Home had to get elected to the Commons first).

The dizzying array of constitutional shenanigans presided over by the Tories have gone on too long. Parliament needs to take back control.

39,Why tariffs could be Trump's undoing | Ross Barkan,Ross Barkan,"In the end, it was not the ceaseless lying, the Muslim ban, the alleged obstruction of justice, the pandering to white supremacists, the demonization of immigrants, or the climate change denialism that most outraged Donald Trump’s party. The norm-shattering president finally became too much for Republican politicians when he threatened to do something else entirely – impose tariffs on Mexican imports.

US-Mexico talks to resume Thursday as tariff deadline nears Read more

On Tuesday, Republican senators emerged enraged from a meeting with Trump, unwilling to stomach his threat to level tariffs as high as 25% on Mexican goods in retaliation for migrants crossing the border. Even Senator Ted Cruz, the former Trump punching-bag (“Lyin’ Ted”) who has since become a reliable Trump ally, railed against the proposed tariffs, calling them “new taxes” on Texan farmers, manufacturers, and small businesses. Otherwise spineless Republican senators are having this change of heart because of an important political reality: tariffs will make goods more expensive in the states they need to capture in 2020.

Like Texas, Michigan would be hit hard by a trade war. Thanks to the automobile industry’s complex supply chains, it is the state most dependent on imports from Mexico – and, as Republicans know all too well, crucial to Trump’s re-election prospects. He is already running 12 points behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders there, according to one recent poll.

Trump’s ongoing trade war with China has cost him political capital throughout the Midwest, where farmers depend on imports and exports. His approval rating in Iowa has dropped a staggering 21 points since he took office. In Wisconsin, he’s lost 19 points, and in Ohio, 18. Trump’s base alone cannot carry him, especially with so many Democrats motivated to drive him out of office.

Q&A Who pays Trump's tariffs, China or US customers and companies? Show Hide US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work. China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices. Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president.

This is the only kind of math Republican lawmakers understand, because it speaks to their survival. The most ravenous Republicans will never desert Trump, and his approval rating among party regulars remains strong, but his 2016 success hinged on razor-thin margins in a handful of midwestern states. There is no path to victory without them. Conservatives beyond the cult of Trump comprehend this – that their dear leader is not infallible, that his 30-year obsession with combating trade deficits could be his undoing.

He lashes out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true end-game

Trump, more through instinct than any kind of sober economic analysis, has long understood that the free-trade agreements of the 1990s hastened globalization, punished the American worker, and allowed jobs to flee elsewhere. He violated the GOP’s orthodoxy on free trade and still commandingly won a primary. He knew tacking left on trade wasn’t going to cost him votes.

But Trump’s hatred of a globalized world that would cheapen the value of labor is not tied up in any defense of the American worker. If it were, he would embrace strong labor unions, consumer protections, and universal healthcare and cheap housing for America’s precarious working class. He rejects actual uplift in favor of lashing out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true end-game. He says his Mexican tariffs will begin on Monday. And then what?

If Trump doesn’t get the immigration concessions from Mexico that he wants, and overrides Republican opposition to impose tariffs starting at 5% on imports, how far will Republicans in Congress go to oppose him?

So far, they have been the most pliant class of lawmakers in recent history, tolerating his rank incompetence in the hope he implements enough of the conservative agenda to set Democrats back a generation. Denying science or catering to white supremacists was not enough to foment any kind of rebellion among Republicans in Congress – they, too, reject the reality of climate change and refuse to ostracize the most hateful elements of their base – but tariffs could do the trick, if only because they pose an electoral challenge for Trump 2020.

There is no Trump economic policy or Trump government as much as the man himself, executing ill-informed policy on instinct. Dissenting voices have been excised. How far Trump goes with his tariffs will be up to Trump. If Trump is defeated next year, it will be because of Trump – his motives, his decisions, his rage. It’s Trump’s trade war. We’re just the casualties.

40,Exit May. Now begins a battle for the soul of our democracy | Gaby Hinsliff,Michael White,"Everything changes, but some things stay the same.

To watch the Queen addressing elderly survivors of D-day this week was to be reminded that the point of monarchy is constancy. All hell might be breaking loose around her, but there she is, dressed as she has dressed for half a century and choosing her words with the care she always has. She has seen enough prime ministers come and go that one more presumably doesn’t make much difference. The rest of us, however, cannot afford to be quite so sanguine.

Friday marks Theresa May’s formal relinquishing of the Tory leadership, which increasingly looks not so much like passing on the torch as dropping a burned-out sparkler and accidentally starting a grass fire. It will be almost the end of July before her replacement is foisted on the nation by those Conservative party members entitled to vote and, already, moves are reportedly underfoot to avoid the new leader facing a confidence vote in parliament. The will of the people has given way to the will of a few hundred thousand people who may barely represent Tory voters, let alone the nation. An awkward silence, meanwhile, shrouds the question of this unelected future prime minister’s democratic mandate.

There is an extraordinary moment in Jeremy Hunt’s new campaign video where the wannabe leader suggests Tories should choose him because otherwise there might have to be a general election that Jeremy Corbyn could win. “Vote for me, and hide from the voters” is a dismal slogan but less shocking than Dominic Raab’s refusal to rule out hiding from parliament too; this week he declined to reject hard Brexiters’ crazed pet idea that parliament be prorogued, or in effect suspended from sitting, to ram a no-deal Brexit through.

It would be government by carjack, almost certainly impossible in practice. But when a prospective leader can’t bring himself to say that this is the stuff of 16th-century monarchs not modern leaders, we slide towards that dark place where people who can’t get what they want by democratic means begin weighing alternatives.

Without wanting to be melodramatic, it’s in weeks like this that you realise how little stands between us and a prime minister of genuinely malign intent; how many democratic norms rely on an understanding that those in power will do the decent thing, or that the Queen will mysteriously intervene at the last minute. The assumption is that party leaders will always voluntarily seek mandates because otherwise voters would punish their high-handedness at the next election. But when the Brexit party didn’t even bother producing a manifesto, that most basic contract between politicians and the people, it feels unwise to take much for granted.

These are shark-infested constitutional waters, yet we’re sailing into them rudderless. May remains prime minister in theory, but government is on hold pending new management. The home, health and foreign secretaries among others are all in campaign mode, and anything the government does for the next six weeks will invariably get sucked into the vortex; there are already rumblings about the appropriateness of publishing updates on no-deal planning during the contest. When the EU extended our deadline for leaving, Britain was warned not to waste that time. Yet the only party leader who has used it to the full is Nigel Farage.

Votes in Peterborough are not yet counted. But whether the Brexit party gets its byelection scalp or not, the sidelining of the Tories in a marginal seat they held until recently has sent shudders through the party. There is no route to a majority for a Conservative party that can’t win a marginal seat even when its previous Labour MP goes to prison. But Farage’s party has been mischievously portraying the byelection as a fight between it and the Liberal Democrats, as if the two main parties barely existed; just hard leave versus hard remain, nothing but tumbleweed between. Playing up the Lib Dems in a Labour-held seat is, of course, a cynical ruse to split the remain vote by sowing confusion about where it should go. But as ruses go it’s clever, tapping into a profound exasperation with the big parties that has left smaller ones calling the tune.

Or more precisely, some of the smaller ones. If politics is now breaking open, then it’s not in the way a handful of Tory and Labour MPs envisaged when they abandoned their old parties to form Change UK, which this week duly split. They wanted to create something new but seem instead to have helped to revive something old, with the Lib Dems enjoying a popularity not seen since the days of Cleggmania as they reap the rewards of having fought Brexit before it was popular.

But if the Tiggers failed to establish themselves as the answer, they were right to identify a problem with their respective old parties, and until Labour and the Conservatives have dealt with the underlying causes of their toxicity they have nothing to feel smug about. If the rise of the Brexit party continues, the change now coming might be the one some have long warned about: a vacancy opening up not in the centre ground of politics but the bigger space occupied by socially conservative voters, frustrated that their views have long been pushed to the fringe.

Polling voters on how they might react to new party leaders is notoriously unreliable because people struggle to guess how they’ll feel in the future about someone they don’t yet know. But with those caveats, polling leaked to the Boris Johnson-supporting Guido Fawkes site this week was instructive. Of five Tory candidates tested, Johnson emerged as most likely to stop votes haemorrhaging to the Brexit party, which is why he’s the frontrunner. But none of them won over enough Labour and Lib Dem supporters to cobble together a majority, with voters scattering in at least four directions. This is the stuff of nightmare coalitions and Faustian bargains. No wonder Tory MPs want to put an election off for as long as possible, in the vague hope something else turns up.

In hyper-volatile times, it’s not completely implausible that something might. Small parties generally thrive when bigger ones screw up, which makes them vulnerable to bigger ones getting their act together again. If Corbyn finally settled on a Brexit position capable of scraping his own lost voters back off the Lib Dems, things could turn upside down overnight. If the momentum created by last month’s election upsets peters out over the summer, and a new Tory leader manages to steal the limelight for something other than Brexit, then the smaller parties might once again struggle to get noticed; their Achilles heel is supporters forgetting about them, or concluding that they’re a wasted vote.

But the deeper the Tories descend into a bidding war over a no deal, the more they make everything about Farage, and the stronger he consequently grows. If that is where this leadership contest is ultimately leading, then they shouldn’t be surprised when the people demand a say on it.

43,Thomas Bjørn: ‘We are privileged with a good life but this is sport’s dark side’ | Donald McRae,Donald Mcrae,"‘I think you hide from it,” Thomas Bjørn says quietly of the anguish which has affected him and so many other professional sportsmen and women. Stepping away from his role as Europe’s Ryder Cup-winning captain in Paris last September, the 48-year-old Dane peels away the facade which conceals the raw problems of mental health in golf.

“When you’re a young man you hide your feelings,” Bjørn says. “You keep pushing it away until you can’t do it any more. I finally realised I had to get everything out. I had to have those conversations with myself in the mirror. I had to be so honest and strip things bare. When I went through it the second time I was receptive to my feelings, to building myself up again.”

Georgia Hall: ‘We’re paid very well on the women’s tour … but the men earn so much more’ | Donald McRae Read more

Bjørn’s and Michael Calvin’s new book, Mind Game, is an unflinching yet beautifully written account of the psychological trauma he suffered as a golfer. It is an equally gripping portrayal of the internal struggle faced by many of his contemporaries. Some of the men Bjørn led to Ryder Cup glory – including Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson – share their moving stories. They offer a salutary reminder that, rather than just being millionaires in golf’s pampered world, they are as vulnerable and conflicted as most people.

The book opens with Bjørn staring at himself in the mirror. His eyes are filled with tears as he asks a series of stark questions: “Why are you crying? Why do you put yourself through this pain? Why do you play this game? Do you really want to continue?”

Bjørn, in his first interview since completing the book, takes a deep breath as we return to these dark moments. “I was close to giving up the game,” he says. “In the end it’s almost like I didn’t want to get up in the morning. This happens because the problems you see in your head are so much bigger than they are in reality. They take over your mind.

I was lucky. I’ve been involved in a lot of Ryder Cups and I’ve never seen players show up in the way my 12 did

“You can ask all the people in the world but in the end, if your mind doesn’t respond, all of that is just noise. You need to take responsibility for what you’re thinking. It’s like trying to quit smoking. If you don’t want to stop smoking, you can have all the help in the world and it’s not going to get you there. But then you wake up one morning and you’re coughing so much, and feeling so crap, you decide: ‘I have to beat this.’ You need to want to do it. My tool was having those conversations with the mirror. Those conversations were not made up. They happened.”

How long did Bjørn’s first bout of depression last? “I went through a season where I certainly didn’t want to get out of bed. I had kids, so I had to. But I wanted to hide from the world – and my life. This was around 2004. I then had a good stretch but I had it again about 2010. The first time lasted a long time because you avoid the truth and try to cut corners. It will stay with you until you look in the mirror.

“That was my tool to deal with it. When you start sliding down it’s very important to remember how you got out of it last time. As you get older that becomes easier. So mental health in young people is something we need to address much more. Young people are much softer and don’t have the life experience. When you’re older and you’ve taken yourself out of the situation twice, three times, it’s easier to see the warning lights.”

Despite its conservative and mannered surface, golf is a brutal sport mentally. As Bjørn says, no other sport offers such a lonely battle where your real opponent is always yourself and you stand over a little white ball which is never touched by any rival. “Snooker is the only sport that comes close. I’m thinking more about the guy sitting and watching when his opponent is at the table. What’s going through his head? That’s the same in golf. The walk between shots gives you so much time. You think of the consequences so much.

“That’s one thing I felt as Ryder Cup captain. In the first six months I had it all in place. But then I had so much time to second-guess myself. Over-analysing in sport, in life, can lead to negative thoughts. An over-active brain is not great for sport. I can get caught in a corner and sit there and think for hours. And then, all of a sudden, it’s easy to get in a downward spiral. It was the same with Henrik Stenson. I’d seen the darkest side of the game through him.”

It says much about the compassion of Bjørn that, recalling the three times he cried on the golf course, he twice shed tears of happiness for his friends. He cried when Adam Scott won the 2013 Masters because he regarded the Australian as being like a younger brother. Even more movingly he could not stop his tears when Stenson won the Open in 2016. Bjørn remembered how, a dozen years before, Stenson was so tormented by his game he could barely hit the ball.

“At that time Henrik got something very much like a brain freeze – of not being able to hit the ball. Watching it then, and we were quite young, you don’t fully understand all he is going through. But in later years, as you get into dark places yourself, you realise what turmoil he must have been in. I learned that you should never judge.

“But from that low Henrik lifted himself to where he became, arguably, the best player in the world for a period of time. That shows how the mind shapes so much of our lives. Sportspeople are privileged with a good life. But that doesn’t mean their mental health will never be affected. They get pushed into pressurised situations all the time – and it can spin itself into a situation where they can’t handle it. This is sport’s dark side.”

Stenson was one of Bjørn’s four captain’s picks in the Ryder Cup last year. His choice of Stenson, Ian Poulter, Sergio García and Paul Casey was criticised as “an old pals’ act” – but his wildcard players won a record 9½ points between them as Europe, inspired by Bjørn’s calm leadership, beat the US 17½-10½.

“I know them so well, those four,” he says simply. “I’m an observer of human beings. I knew how they would react. But it was not just these four. All 12 of my European players were willing to listen and do everything for each other. I was lucky. I’ve been involved in a lot of Ryder Cups and I’ve never seen players show up in the way my 12 did.”

Tiger, the biggest icon the game has ever had, coming from the darkest of dark places, to rise again

Bjørn cried in Paris when, after the cup had been won, he saw his children. In that moment did he also feel he was no longer typecast as the man who lost the Open in a bunker? On the 16th tee of the final round of the 2003 Open at Royal St George’s Bjørn held a two-shot lead with three holes to play – but it took him three shots to get out of that deadly bunker. Bjørn lost the Open and the scars ran deep. Surely most people now think of him as a victorious Ryder Cup captain?

“Probably more people associate me with this now – and not something that happened 16 years ago in a bunker on the south coast of England. Hopefully that balances it out. But people who were there, or watched it on TV, will always remember my moments in that bunker.”

Eamonn Magee: ‘My father convinced the IRA to give me one bullet’ Read more

Did it impact on his mental health? “Yes. I thought I dealt with it really well in the moment, because it’s only golf. It’s not life-threatening. It’s a moment that gives somebody else success. That happens in sport all the time. But once you’re in it you stand alone. Every time you met somebody that was the only thing they asked you about. In the end it gets you.”

Bjørn’s empathy for those who have fallen much further is at the root of his admiration for Tiger Woods’s comeback. Seven weeks ago, when Woods arrowed an eight-iron to within three feet of the hole at the 16th on the Sunday afternoon at Augusta, to virtually seal the Masters and his first major victory in 11 years, Bjørn texted Calvin: “Unbelievable. This is the best moment in the history of the game.”

“I tried to explain to Mike,” Bjørn says, “that, for golf, this is the greatest moment. This is the biggest icon the game has ever had, coming from the darkest of dark places, to rise again. This was not about golf. This was about a human being taking himself from the deepest low. I can’t even begin to think about how dark some of those moments have been for Tiger. Now he’s got the taste for it again. If he stays fully healthy he will win more.”

One of his Ryder Cup stars, Rory McIlroy, won four majors by the time he was 25 but has now waited five years and is yet to win another. “His talent is exceptional. But sometimes the game is so easy for him his concentration fails. But, like Tiger, Rory will win more majors. Once he wins another, and I’m 100% certain he will, he’ll kick on and do more.” In his more modest way Bjørn fulfilled the promise he made before the Ryder Cup that he would have a tattoo of the trophy inked on his behind. He went to a tattoo parlour in Soho and, as he smiles now, “I fortunately can’t see it. But I’ll always have that tattoo to remind me of something exceptional I never dreamt could have gone so well.”

Did the tattoo artist know anything about golf? “Nothing. He did it quite well, though.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bjørn shakes hands with Tiger Woods after Europe won the Ryder Cup at the Belfry in 2002. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian

Bjørn still plays golf, on a limited basis, as he works out what he wants to do with the rest of his life. “I’m not really making any big decisions yet. I said after the Ryder Cup I needed three months. I probably need a full year to let the world settle down. I love playing. I love travelling. I love being on tour. I don’t know 80% of the players now. There are young kids coming through from all corners of the world that are fantastic players. I love seeing developments in the game and being in it. I still want to live my life from inside the ropes.”

The game almost broke him but now, free from the anguish which stalked him so long, Bjørn sounds at peace. “I used to blame the game for how I was feeling. But you end up hating golf because it’s easy to hate. It’s like hating a government because it’s easy to blame somebody else. But this is your life and you can turn it around. It’s not the game’s fault. I am happy I found a way to learn to love the game, and life, again.”

44,Johanna Konta errors hand French Open semi-final to Vondroušová,Kevin Mitchell,"• British No 1 knocked out in straight sets, 7-5, 7-6 (2) • Konta squandered three points at 5-3 to take first set

Johanna Konta failed to give the record books one more nudge here on Friday, twice blowing a 5-3 lead against the most talented teenager in tennis, Markéta Vondroušová, who held her composure to win 7-5, 7-6 (2) and earn a place in the final of the French Open against the Australian Ashleigh Barty.

“It wasn’t a pretty match, but this player had the most guts,” was the spot-on verdict of seven-time champion, Chris Evert. Konta, who played brilliantly in her previous two matches, tightened up under pressure and paid the price for 41 unforced errors in the hour and 45 minutes it lasted in a steady drizzle on the new Court Simonne Mathieu.

It was lovely setting for a slaughter, up against the trees and plants of the adjoining garden, and 19-year-old Vondroušová came with the appropriate tattoo on her arm: “No rain, no flowers.” She blossomed in the rain, too slick for her 28-year-old opponent, who was striving to become the first British finalist here since Sue Barker won the title 43 years ago.

Ashleigh Barty books French Open final place with win over Anisimova Read more

But she can look back on a gritty, at times excellent campaign, correcting the impression she had been lumbered with as a sitting target on the clay of Roland Garros after four first-round exits in a row.

“It was a very tough match,” Vondroušová said courtside, “and I’m just happy that I held my nerve at the end.”

“As Chris Evert said, she handled the conditions and the pressure better today,” Annabel Croft said of Konta’s performance. “She seemed to take it in her stride in her first grand slam semi-final.”

On Court Suzanne Lenglen, Barty did what Konta should have done, recovering from setbacks after almost blowing a 5-0 lead in the first set to see off the other teenager to make the concluding weekend, Amanda Anisimova, and won 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-3 in just under two hours.

Barty said of her comeback victory, “Both good and bad memories. that was the hardest things I’ve ever had to do but I enjoyed every minute. I fought my hardest and here we are. It’s amazing.”

She said of blowing her first-set lead, “I felt like that happened really quickly and then I went away from what was working. Amanda is so aggressive, she was able to take advantage of that. But I’m proud of the way I fought and I was able to get back in to that match.”

She added: “These conditions are incredibly tough – cold and windy – for both of us. I can’t believe it. It’s incredible. It’s just been an amazing journey that I’ve been on and I can’t wait to see what happens tomorrow.”

Konta could hardly have started better, winning the first 10 points, as Vondroušová struggled for rhythm. After all the confected fuss over the rearranged schedule and courts, there were precious few fans in the seats in the early games. The players clearly did not care one way or another, just happy to be on court under grey skies, with the clouds hanging on to their schedule-wrecking water. They were here to play tennis, and the British No 1 was playing it a good deal better than the future of the women’s game, 2-1 up with a break after 10 minutes.

But she then lost six points in a row as the tall, graceful Czech teenager with the wicked left-handed game got back into the fight. Konta saved four break points and double-faulted to allow Vondroušová to resume parity. It was now a real contest, with no certainties, a battle of nerves as much as talent. When Konta broke again for a 3-2 lead, the pendulum took a second swing.

After half an hour of a knife-edge tussle, Konta continued to hit freely, surviving a disputed line call to hold for 5-3, and the pressure switched to Vondroušová – who double-faulted for the fourth time to give her opponent a third set point. But Konta made a mess of a simple volley then dumped a tougher drop shot. They would prove to be her most expensive mistakes of the tournament.

With nerves jangling on both sides of the net, Vondroušová held. A spectator distracted Konta at 15-0 and she dollied a poor drop shot to give Vondroušová an easy point. A misjudged backhand found the tramlines and, with rain threatening, Konta hurried her game with another set-up return, dropping serve for 5-all.

A fifth double fault by the teenager gave Konta encouragement in the 11th game, but she needed to hold to stay in the set, having had it in her gift moments earlier. A hot Konta backhand went wide. Vondroušová put up a semi-lob that dropped inside the line, and the set was hers.

Having paid heavily for 20 unforced errors and after losing five games in a row, Konta repaired the damage to break for 2-1 in the second. At 4-2, the sureness of shot she showed in her two previous matches, both widely lauded as excellent, returned – but not for long enough.

She got in and out of trouble on her serve and, for the second time in the match, led 5-3. Vondroušová held to love, looking calm. Konta, serving to level, let her off the hook to surrender two break points and double-faulted for 5-all.

The drizzle turned to a steadier stream. Konta looked tight. Vondroušová, way more relaxed, held to love for the second time in a row for a 6-5 lead. Konta found a little extra to force the tie-break. But the errors kept flowing, as Vondroušová was happy to extend each point.

47,England fans say police raised batons amid ‘dangerous crushing’ at semi-final,Sean Ingle,"England supporters have criticised the stadium authorities and Uefa for not doing enough to stop “dangerous crushing” after the electronic ticket system stopped working before the Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands.

Fans also criticised Portuguese police for failing to intervene when around 800 fans were penned by gates six and seven at the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques – and then raising batons at them when asked for help.

One England supporter, Tom Ambrose, who posted pictures of the incident on social media, accused the police of “standing back and allowing dangerous crushing”.

“Everyone soaked through, some stood for five hours,” he added. “Kids in tears, women fainting. No violence, just panic. When people asked for help, police raised batons and sparked further crushes.”

Another England fan, Adam Coatham, told the Guardian that police had said that the ticket scanners outside gates six and seven had failed.

“Having arrived in a barely moving queue 45 minutes pre-game, gates were slammed shut 10 minutes pre-kick-off with thousands locked out,” he said. “Riot police then stormed in with batons. I tried to head to another gate but was shoved away by police.”

“There were no serious injuries, more by fortune than design,” added Coatham. “Gates six and seven were utter gridlock and a mess. We arrived 45 minutes before kick-off so the usual ‘arrived late’ default response counts for nothing.”

A third fan, Thomas O’Dea, said that the stadium was not equipped to cope with international football. “Guimarães is a lovely little stadium and a nice old-fashioned place but sadly isn’t capable of hosting huge international games,” he said. “The whole electronic ticket system was a shambles. No surprise the gates got charged in the end.”

A Uefa spokesman confirmed that the had been congestion and that police had “intervened to maintain order” before deciding to open the gates to let fans into the stadium.

“The turnstile operation at certainly parts of the stadium tonight was slightly slower than anticipated and this – coupled with the late arrival of supporters at the stadium – led to congestion at some entrances,” he told the Guardian.

“As fans started to push their way to the entrance, a dozen police officers briefly intervened to restore order. After assessing the situation, the police decided to open the turnstiles and let around 800 fans – who all had already undergone the initial ticket check – enter the stadium.”

Meanwhile many fans also reported issues with the late trains back from Guimarães to Porto, with some reporting queuing for hours to get back.

As one put it: “What a joke of an organisation Uefa is. We had to queue for just under three hours to get a train home in the rain. We were one of the lucky ones by the sounds of it. Town, station and stadium inadequate for such occasion.”

Guimarães hosted two matches at Euro 2004, both involving Italy.

Police in the western German city of Düsseldorf have detained 16 men following a mass brawl between English football fans. Officers were called to the old town on Thursday after “about 40 supporters of various British clubs” began throwing chairs, tables, beer glasses and bottles at each other.

Düsseldorf police say four people required medical treatment and the brawl caused “significant property damage”. Police say the detained men, between the ages of 32 and 56, included supporters of Newcastle and Everton. None are residents of Germany.","England supporters have criticised the stadium authorities and Uefa for not doing enough to stop “dangerous crushing” after the electronic ticket system stopped working before the Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands.

48,England wary as Bangladesh hope for a World Cup repeat in Cardiff | Vic Marks,Vic Marks,"Match 12 of the World Cup is upon us and it is now possible to predict that there are no certainties left. At the start of the tournament the matches tended to go with the formbook – except perhaps when West Indies thrashed Pakistan. Since then Bangladesh have beaten South Africa, Pakistan have defeated England and Australia managed to prevail despite being 79 for five after 17 overs against West Indies. For all except the fervently committed there is a delicious uncertainty about what’s going off out there.

In Cardiff on Saturday England meet Bangladesh and it would be daft to presume a cast-iron victory for Eoin Morgan’s side. The days of dismissing Bangladesh as a minnow have long since passed. That may have been the case in June 2005 when Bangladesh, with a youthful Mashrafe Mortaza opening the bowling – he is now captaining the side but not opening the bowling – took on Ricky Ponting’s Australians at Sophia Gardens.

Liam Plunkett expects England to rise above ‘niggly’ Bangladesh Read more

That game was expected to be a routine formality but at the end Bangladesh had startled everyone, winning by five wickets with Mohammed Ashraful hitting an unbeaten century. Just about everything went wrong for the mighty Aussies including Andrew Symonds turning up less than sober and, unsurprisingly, being dropped from the lineup. So Mortaza can convey happy memories of Cardiff to his teammates.

England will turn up sober and aware that they face dangerous opponents, though they may not wish to remind themselves that they have played Bangladesh three times in the World Cup and have lost twice – in their last two meetings in Chittagong in 2011 and Adelaide in 2015. The Bangladesh side contains some of the most experienced international cricketers on the circuit. Their all-rounder Mahmudullah, who has often tormented England, has played 177 ODIs; Tamim Iqbal (195), Shakib Al Hasan (200), Mushfiqur Rahim (207) and Mortaza (211 matches) have played more than that.

So far in the tournament Bangladesh have been involved in two thrilling games and it has been clear that they relish these tight finishes. No one intimidates them now. At the Oval they outplayed South Africa and in their next match they made the Kiwis fight to the bitter end.

It may be that the conditions will be less appealing to them in Cardiff. The pitches at the Oval have been dry, offering a smidgeon of encouragement to spin bowlers; in Cardiff there was a surprising amount of grass left on the pitch – especially for Sri Lanka v New Zealand. And there has been rain around. It might suit England if there was a generous covering of grass visible on Saturday morning especially if they win the toss and have the justification to do what they always prefer doing, bowling first.

So far the Bangladesh spinners have been very effective, especially the ageless all-rounder, Shakib. He has been one of the most successful slow bowlers in the tournament so far, even though he seldom persuades the ball to deviate significantly off the pitch. His threat stems from his accuracy, his shrewd variations of pace and flight and an ability to intuit what the batsman at the other end is thinking. He has conventional support from the young off-spinner Mehidy Hasan who often takes the new ball. This means that England’s opening batsmen may well be confronted with a spinner at the start of the innings for the third match in succession. So far this ploy has produced an early wicket.

England could embark on this match with a solitary spinner especially if the grass is still greener on the other side of the Channel. The dimensions of Cardiff are similar to those at Bristol, with short, straight boundaries and longer ones square of the wicket. In these circumstances Morgan has often opted to omit Moeen Ali though bearing in mind current form and fitness it might be Adil Rashid who misses out.

A bigger challenge for England is to recover their poise after such a tetchy, ill-disciplined performance against Pakistan. At Trent Bridge Joe Root and Jos Buttler suggested that they were stimulated by the World Cup challenge – even though they could not finish the job once they had completed their centuries. There is currently some evidence that some of the others are not quite so in control amid the peculiar demands of a World Cup contest.

It has been evident from within and without the dressing rooms that a World Cup match is a vastly different proposition to a standard ODI in the middle of a bilateral series. The tension multiplies. The consequence of a defeat looms larger, all of which makes the spectacle so much more captivating. Against South Africa England coped with that additional challenge extremely well; indeed they seemed to be enhanced by the occasion, especially in the field. But against Pakistan the opposite was the case.

The match against Bangladesh in Cardiff provides Morgan and his team with an opportunity to demonstrate that their performance against Pakistan was a blip rather than a fatal flaw in the side’s make-up. Whatever the limitations of the Bangladesh side, now shrewdly coached by Steve Rhodes after his three decades at Worcester, there is every indication that they welcome the chance to enhance their exceptional record against England in World Cup cricket.","Match 12 of the World Cup is upon us and it is now possible to predict that there are no certainties left.

SL Vivianne Miedema. The World Cup in Canada came too soon for her but this year she is going to roll her form for Arsenal on to the biggest stage.

CM This could come down to who faces a really weak team in the group stage, so I think Sam Kerr of Australia is going to bang in a ton a goals and continue scoring all the way to the final.

RP The magic formula seems to be a healthy group-stage mismatch coupled with being the main source of goals for your side. I’d love to pick Norway’s Caroline Graham Hansen, but with Thailand plus Chile in the group I cannot go past USA’s Alex Morgan.

KP Sam Kerr. She has scored six goals in six games this year for Chicago Red Stars and bagged 17 in 13 matches for Perth Glory in the most recent season.

RP Either France or Germany will offer a huge surprise – toss a coin if it’s good or bad, however. The Germans have such big-tournament pedigree but are in transition. France will either be buoyed by home support or crushed spectacularly under its expectations.

KP South Korea have one of the hardest draws, in a group with France, Nigeria and Norway. But led by Chelsea’s midfielder Ji So-yun, they might well surprise. It has been nine years since South Korea won the Under-17 World Cup, and a core from that team lead their golden generation.

Who will be the breakthrough player?

LT Canada’s Kadeisha Buchanan. A fantastic intuitive defender with pace to burn. At 23 she is a leading light of the women’s game but will showcase her central defensive talents to an infinitely wider audience. England’s Beth Mead could, and should, also return as a real star.

SW There is lots of quality in the Scotland squad but when your back is against the wall you want Erin Cuthbert fighting for you. Last year she fired Chelsea to a league and FA Cup double and this year has kept her struggling side afloat.

SL Khadija Shaw. Again it depends on her fitness but on her day she is absolutely incredible and could announce herself like Marta did in 2003.

CM I’ve already talked about Sam Kerr but another player to watch is Delphine Cascarino. The France winger could turn some heads.

56,Greece U-turns over draft law redefining rape after fierce criticism,Helena Smith,"Greece’s government has rushed to revise legislation that redefines rape after unprecedented criticism from activists, human rights groups and senior judicial officials.

The law, part of a new penal code submitted to parliament by Alexis Tsipras’ administration only weeks before snap elections, had raised fears of convicted rapists being treated more leniently.

In a move hailed as a historic victory by activists, the justice minister Michalis Kalogirou caved in on Thursday.

Less than 24 hours after women’s groups had converged on parliament in protest, he amended the bill, known as Article 336, clarifying that sex without consent would be considered rape and, as such, punishable under the law.

“Whoever attempts a sexual act without the consent of the victim is punished by imprisonment of up to 10 years,” the revised law states. It is expected to be put to MPs on Friday.

Reacting to the last-minute change, the head of Amnesty International’s Greece office, Eirini Gaitanou, said: “This is a historic victory, not just for the campaigners who have fought long and hard for this day, but for all women in Greece.

“The newly amended law finally recognises the simple truth that sex without consent is rape and makes it clear that physical violence is not required for the crime to be considered rape … [it] should give hope to people campaigning for consent-based laws wherever they are.”

Only a handful of countries have recognised that sex without consent should be treated legally as akin to rape. Once passed, Greece will become only the tenth country in Europe to enshrine that recognition in its criminal code.

Gaitanou said it was also imperative that guidelines were given to ensure police and public prosecutors enforced the legislation.

“It is now time for everyone involved in the criminal justice system to be given clear guidance as to how this change in the law must be implemented to make it easier for survivors to get justice,” she said.

Before the amendment there had been widespread fears the draft legislation would dramatically weaken laws on rape.

It categorised some rapes as a misdemeanour rather than a felony, and critics – including female members of Tsipras’ Syriza party - had argued that convicted rapists could face prison sentences of as little as three years.

In redefining the crime, the new bill all but ignored the issue of freely given consent and focussed instead on the use of violence, resistance involved and the physical threat posed to a victim’s life. Human rights groups had described the lack of emphasis on non-consensual sex as “deeply problematic” citing “involuntary paralysis” or “freezing” that experts have recognised as an instinctive response to sexual assault.

The women’s rights group Equality Now, which had called for the immediate withdrawal of the bill, had argued that the draft legislation offered wide scope in judicial interpretation.

Had it been applied, the law would also have amounted to a dereliction of duty for a country that had committed to criminalise non-consensual sexual acts under the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention, which Athens ratified last year.

“It is very welcome that the government listened to the voices of women’s rights advocates in Greece and other experts to make changes to the law,” Equality Now’s Europe director, Jacqui Hunt, said. “Anything that lets potential perpetrators of sexual violence off the hook creates an environment for further violence and does a huge disservice to the women affected.”","Greece’s government has rushed to revise legislation that redefines rape after unprecedented criticism from activists, human rights groups and senior judicial officials.

Industrial production in Europe’s largest economy fell 1.9%, which was the worst monthly fall in almost four years, according to Germany’s statistics office. It was much worse than the 0.4% decline forecast by economists.

Exports fell by 3.7% in April compared with the previous month, while imports also fell.

German industry, the powerhouse of the European economy, has suffered in the past year as trade tensions between the US and China have put the brakes on global trade growth. The German car sector, a major exporter, has also been hit by a decline in demand for vehicles in the EU and China.

The export fall in April was in part driven by a sharp 8.7% year-on-year fall in exports to the EU’s non-eurozone economies – the largest of which is the UK. Exports to the UK fell by €1.6bn (£1.4bn) in April compared to the previous year, to €5.6bn – a 22% year-on-year fall.

“This is a horrible start to the second quarter for German industry, as global trade tensions as well as temporary problems in the automotive sector and chemical industry have left their marks,” said Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist in Germany for the Dutch bank ING.

Germany’s Bundesbank on Friday sharply downgraded its growth forecasts for this year and next in response to the signs of a slowdown. Economists at the central bank expect German GDP to rise by only 0.6% this year, down from the 1.6% predicted back in December.

On Thursday the European Central Bank said it would keep its main interest rate at 0%, at least through the first half of 2020, rather than looking to raise the cost of borrowing around the end of this year.

The latest industry figures suggest the German economy slowed sharply in the second quarter of 2019, according to Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy. German GDP growth bounced back to 0.4% quarter on quarter in the first three months of the year after narrowly avoiding a recession at the end of 2018.

Kenningham said: “German industry is still struggling with both domestic and external headwinds, including the weakness of global trade, slowdown in household consumption growth and regulatory confusion in the auto sector. We don’t expect a sustained improvement any time soon.”","German exports and industrial output fell sharply in April, triggering fresh fears that trade tensions and continued Brexit uncertainty are weighing on the global growth outlook.

60,Barcelona port is worst in Europe for cruise ship air pollution,Stephen Burgen,"The port of Barcelona, a city already overwhelmed by mass tourism, has topped a list of 50 European ports for the amount of air pollution produced there by cruise ships, according to a report.

In 2017 cruise ships emitted 32.8 tonnes of sulphur oxide (SOx) in Barcelona, according to the research. Palma de Mallorca was the second most polluted, with 28 tonnes, followed by Venice with 27.5. Southampton, with 19.7 tonnes, was fifth on the list.

Barcelona also leads in the amount of carcinogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) particles the ships emit. Cruise ships account for 15% of the NOx emitted by all of Europe’s passenger vehicles.

“Cities are, and with reason, banning diesel vehicles but at the same time are allowing free entry to cruise ship companies whose ships’ emissions cause immeasurable damage,” said Faig Abbasov, maritime coordinator of the NGO behind the report, Brussels-based Transport and Environment.

Ships run on fuel oil, which contains about 2,000 times more sulphur oxide than ordinary diesel. The report claims that cruise ships docking in European ports produced 10 times more sulphur emissions than all the 260m cars in those countries combined. In the case of Barcelona, in 2017 cruise ships emitted nearly five times as much SOx as all the city’s cars.

A recent report by the environmental group Ecologists in Action said toxic particles from the ships were detected as far as 249 miles (400km) from Barcelona’s port. The impact is exacerbated by ships leaving their engines running while in port.

The city is Europe’s busiest cruise ship destination, with some 2.7 million passengers disembarking from 800 ships in 2017. On a single day last October, seven ships with 18,000 passengers and 6,000 crew were docked in the port.

Environmental groups and residents associations in the city have campaigned for years for the numbers to be curbed. Last year, the Symphony of the Seas, the world’s largest cruise ship, was met by protests when it arrived in Barcelona for its maiden voyage.

Campaigners argue that not only are the ships endangering residents’ health, especially those who live near the port, they are a form of tourism that brings few benefits to the city.

Most passengers visit the city for around five hours, spending an average of €57 each, and return to their ships at night.

Gala Pin, a Barcelona councillor who represents the old city that adjoins the port, raised a few eyebrows last year when she compared cruise ship tourists to locusts.

“In my opinion, we shouldn’t have this kind of tourism,” she said. “It’s like a plague of locusts. They devour the public space and then they leave.”

While the city authorities have tried to limit the number of ships, they are good business for the port, which is managed by central government, not the city council.

The International Maritime Organization limits the amount of sulphur in fuel oil to 3.5% and in 2020 a new limit of 0.5% will come into force. However, under the European Union’s clean air policy, the limit in the Mediterranean may be reduced to 0.1%.



Under current rules, there is a policy of zero emissions while ships are docked in Baltic, North Sea and Channel ports, and there are plans to extend this to the Mediterranean.

61,"Huawei must raise 'shoddy' standards, says senior UK cybersecurity official",John Naughton,"GCHQ technical director says he hasn’t seen anything that reassures him company is taking necessary security steps

China’s Huawei Technologies needs to raise its “shoddy” security standards which fall below rivals, a senior British cyber security official said on Thursday, as the company came under increasing pressure internationally.

The US has led allegations that Huawei’s equipment can be used by Beijing for espionage operations, with Washington urging allies to bar the company from 5G networks.

British officials have also raised concerns about security issues but said they can manage the risks and have seen no evidence of spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations against it.

Huawei poses security threat to UK, says former MI6 chief Read more

“Huawei as a company builds stuff very differently to their Western counterparts. Part of that is because of how quickly they’ve grown up, part of it could be cultural – who knows,” said Ian Levy, Technical Director of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency.

“What we have learnt as a result of that, the security is objectively worse, and we need to cope with that,” he told a conference in London.

Asked about how Huawei compares with its competitors, Levy said: “Certainly nothing is perfect, certainly Huawei is shoddy, the others are less shoddy.”

The United States has placed sanctions on Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of mobile network equipment, and tried to block it from buying US goods. Washington has also said it will limit intelligence sharing with allies who continue to use the company’s technology.

Britain’s National Security Council decided in April to block Huawei from all core parts of its future 5G network but to give it restricted access to non-core parts.

That decision came after a British government report in March rebuked the company for failing to fix long-standing security flaws in its equipment and revealed new “significant technical issues.”

Huawei has pledged to spend more than $2bn as part of efforts to address the problems but also warned it could take up to five years to see results.

Levy said he had not yet seen any action by the company to reassure him Huawei was taking the necessary steps and “the start of a high-level plan that we can talk about in public would be a good thing.”

“To be fair, they have a lot of work to do, and I think they know that,” he said. “You wouldn’t expect to have, in six months since we published that report, less than that, them coming out going ‘we’ve fixed it.’ That would be unachievable.”","GCHQ technical director says he hasn’t seen anything that reassures him company is taking necessary security stepsChina’s Huawei Technologies needs to raise its “shoddy” security standards which fall below rivals, a senior British cyber security official said on Thursday, as the company came under increasing pressure internationally.

62,'Straight pride' group removes Brad Pitt as mascot after actor complains,Catherine Shoard,"A group of activists defending heterosexual rights have taken down a photograph of Brad Pitt from its website. Super Happy Fun America had adopted the actor as an unofficial mascot for the movement, which seeks to “advocates on behalf of the straight community” and describes straight people as “an oppressed majority”.

The move follows a complaint by Pitt’s representatives, who confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter on Thursday that they had officially requested the group stop using his name and likeness.

The site had previously declared: “Congratulations to Mr Pitt for being the face of this important civil rights movement.” The line was accompanied by two photographs of the actor: one from the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith, in which he co-starred with his future spouse Angelina Jolie, and another in which he is being lassoed by his former wife Jennifer Aniston.

The site’s homepage now prominently displays an amended version of its previous announcement, redacting the actor’s name and declaring the images “censored”, while another post, published on Friday, revealed its new mascot as the controversial author and far-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos.

“Due to a scheduling conflict,” reads a press release, “our former mascot is no longer available. Not to worry, we found someone younger, more handsome, and more in tune with heroic masculine virtues.”

Yiannopoulos will act as both mascot and grand marshall of a proposed parade to be staged by the group in Boston, mirroring the route taken by the city’s annual Pride parade.

“I might technically be a sequined and perfectly coiffed friend of Dorothy’s,” says Yiannopoulos in a statement, “but I’ve spent my entire career advocating for the rights of America’s most brutally repressed identity – straight people – so I know a thing or two about discrimination.

“This parade is a gift to anyone, male or female, black or white – gay and transgender allies, too! – who will stand with us and celebrate the wonder and the majesty of God’s own heterosexuality. Men, bring your most toxic selves. Women, prepare to burn your briefcases! Because it’s great to be straight, and we’re not apologising for it any more. We’re Here, Not Queer.”

The club’s vice president, Mark Sahady, said the proposed march was a response to the Massachusetts administration turning down the group’s request that a “straight pride flag” be raised at city hall.

“We will fight for the right of straights everywhere to express pride in themselves without fear of judgment and hate,’ said John Hugo, president of the group. “The day will come when straights will finally be included as equals among all of the other orientations.”

On Wednesday, the actor Chris Evans took issue with the group’s proposed march on Twitter, describing it as the work of closeted toddlers.

Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) Wow! Cool initiative, fellas!! Just a thought, instead of ‘Straight Pride’ parade, how about this: The ‘desperately trying to bury our own gay thoughts by being homophobic because no one taught us how to access our emotions as children’ parade? Whatta ya think? Too on the nose?? https://t.co/gaBWtq2PaL

Pitt, who has won praise for his role as an ageing stuntman in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, said in 2006 that he would only marry his then-girlfriend, Angelina Jolie, when people of all sexual orientations could do so in the US. His activism to overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 legislation that temporarily made same-sex marriage illegal again California, has involved substantial financial donations to the cause, as well as taking part in a staged reading of Dustin Lance Black’s play about the legislation.","A group of activists defending heterosexual rights have taken down a photograph of Brad Pitt from its website.

It's not just girls – one in 30 young men were married as children

One in 30 young men were married as children, according to the first UN analysis of child marriage rates among boys.

Around 115 million boys and men around the world were married before they turned 18, according to Unicef, which warned the issue is often overlooked.

“When we think about child marriage we often think about girls, and rightly so because girls are most affected,” said Claudia Cappa, senior statistics adviser for Unicef, and one of the report’s authors. “But boys do marry in childhood.”

“It’s a rights violation,” she added. “It creates a burden for boys to take on adult responsibilities and roles when they are still children themselves – like providing for a family.”

Child marriage in Niger is a cultural issue, not an Islamic one Read more

The analysis found that countries where child marriage among boys was most prevalent did not necessarily have the highest rates of child marriage among girls. Niger, for instance, where three in four girls are married before they reach 18, had much lower rates of child marriage among boys, said Cappa. “Girls [in Niger] tend to marry older men, that’s why you don’t see child marriage in boys to the same extent,” she said.

The analysis is based on data from household surveys across 82 low and middle income countries, which found that one in 21 young men and boys had been married as children. Once wealthier countries are factored in, the prevalence rate drops to one in 30. The researchers assume the prevalence of child marriage among boys is close to zero in wealthier countries.

While child marriage among girls is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, cases among boys are prevalent in countries across a range of regions.

Central African Republic, where almost a third of boys and men are child grooms, had the highest rate of child marriage among boys, followed by Nicaragua (19%), Madagascar (13%), Nauru (12%) and Honduras (12%), according to research published in the journal Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies.

Girls are disproportionately affected by child marriage: one in five young women aged 20 to 24 were married before they turned 18. A greater proportion of girls are also married before the age of 15, said Cappa, and they are more likely to face health problems related to early pregnancy and childbirth.

The study concluded that, much like girls, boys most at risk of child marriage tend to come from the poorest households, live in rural areas and have little or no education. Researchers concluded that greater work is needed to identify more specific drivers of marriage among boys.

Very little research has studied male child marriage because it is only relatively recently that data has been collected by governments, said Cappa. She added that previous efforts to tackle child marriage have focused on child brides because much larger number of girls are affected.

“Ultimately there is also a cultural element that comes into play,” she said. “It is the same for other topics as well – think about sexual violence, for instance. For a time it was believed men are not affected or the impact was not as significant – this is not true.”

The prevalence of child marriage is decreasing globally, according to Unicef, with the most progress in the past decade seen in south Asia, where a girl’s risk of marrying in childhood has dropped by more than a third, from nearly 50% to 30%.

Most countries around the world have laws that set a minimum age of marriage, usually at 18. However, many countries have exceptions to this rule, for example, in cases where there is parental consent.","Central African Republic has the highest rate of boy grooms, followed by Nicaragua, Madagascar, Nauru and HondurasIt's not just girls – one in 30 young men were married as childrenOne in 30 young men were married as children, according to the first UN analysis of child marriage rates among boys.

Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, can be seen walking purposefully towards the man before striking him in the head.

Footage shows the man falling to the floor as Robinson shouts: “Fuck about again you’ll get knocked out again, bruv.”

The video appears to have been filmed outside the Estádio D Afonso Henriques in Guimarães, where England lost 3-1 to the Netherlands in a Uefa Nations League semi-final match on Thursday night.

The incident took place little more than a week after the English Defence League founder’s humiliating defeat in the European elections.

In a message to his supporters on Friday, Robinson showed no remorse and claimed he had been defending himself and was “fed up of being a punchbag for people”.

Robinson, who has at least five convictions for violence and public order offences, said: “I was walking through there – I hadn’t had a drink, I was with my wife – that man … come [sic] up to me twice getting rowdy, in my face, being abusive, being aggressive.

“You can see his friend has his hand on him and I said to my wife, ‘I can see where this is going to go, walk away’, and I said to the man’s friend, ‘Keep that man away from me’. He comes back up to me again like that and watch what happens to him.”

The footage shows Robinson, 37, striding towards the man saying “Who said that?”, but it is not clear what the other man is supposed to have said.

Addressing supporters on the encrypted app Telegram, Robinson said: “I’m not going to wait for him to attack me. Twice I warned him. Twice I warned his friends.

“All those people there with him – they’re not my friends, their [sic] his. Four of them are his friends. I told them ‘What does he think he’s doing? Keep him away from me’. The man should keep his opinions to himself and his mouth to himself.”

In a separate video published by Robinson, the Luton-born activist is shown being challenged by a man inside the stadium about the incident.

Robinson can be seen remonstrating with the man before saying: “Think about it. You’re with your friends and I’m with my wife. Think about how much of a wanker that is.

68,Spanish king asks Socialists to form new government,Afp In Madrid,"Spain’s King Felipe VI has tasked acting prime minister Pedro Sánchez with forming a new government, a complex undertaking that will involve negotiations with diverging parties.

While they won a general election in April and gained lawmakers compared with the previous term, Sánchez’s Socialists failed to secure a majority in parliament and will need the support of other groupings.

But despite the obvious horse-trading that entails, Sánchez is widely expected to get the backing he needs to start his second term as prime minister.

Without the necessary seats in parliament to form a majority, the conservative Popular party, centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and far-right Vox have already resigned themselves to being in opposition.

The Spanish parliament’s speaker, Meritxell Batet, told a news conference on Thursday that the king had asked Sánchez to attempt to create a coalition that can govern.

The monarch has been meeting party representatives at the royal palace since Wednesday, as is the norm after elections.

“It’s a responsibility which I assume with honour,” Sánchez told a news conference.

“There is no possible alternative. Either the Socialist party governs or the Socialist party governs,” he said.

The 47-year-old’s party won 123 seats out of 350 in the general election on 28 April.

“He is profiting from the fact that the opposition is very fragmented, and can’t organise any alternative majority,” said Pablo Simon, a politics expert at Madrid’s Carlos III University.

Negotiations with other parties will not be easy – in all, 17 political groupings are represented in Spain’s fragmented national parliament.

The leftwing coalition Unidas Podemos, with its 42 seats, has already shown its willingness to back Sánchez in the traditional parliamentary confidence vote that follows any general election.

But in exchange, it wants to enter a coalition government.

“What would be most sensible would be if there is a progressive coalition government in Spain … that guarantees political stability for the next four years,” said Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.

The socialists are not keen on that scenario, preferring to rule alone in a minority government which would seek the support of other parties on a case-by-case basis when passing laws or reforms.

Even with the support of Unidas Podemos, Sánchez will still need other regional parties to get the majority he needs.

He will however try to avoid courting Catalan and Basque separatist lawmakers, which would be likely to lead to accusations that he is putting the unity of Spain in peril.

Two weeks after municipal and regional elections, negotiations have already started at a local level and could also influence which parties decide to give their support or not.

No date for the vote in parliament to elect a PM has been set but it is likely to be in early July, a parliamentary source said.","Spain’s King Felipe VI has tasked acting prime minister Pedro Sánchez with forming a new government, a complex undertaking that will involve negotiations with diverging parties.

Vietnam blogger jailed for six years for Facebook posts calling for peaceful protests

An environmental activist has been jailed for six years in Vietnam for “anti-state” Facebook posts, as part of the country’s continuing crackdown on social media.

Nguyen Ngoc Anh, a shrimp farming engineer, was sentenced to six years in jail for “making, storing, disseminating or propagandising materials and products that aim to oppose the state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam”, related to a series of Facebook posts from last year.

Nguyen was arrested in September for sharing and writing Facebook posts which allegedly urged people to take part in peaceful protests in June.

He had also voiced criticism about the controversial Formosa environmental disaster in 2016, which saw a Taiwanese steel company dump toxic waste into the ocean near the coast of Hà Tĩnh and three other provinces in central Vietnam, killing millions of fish.

According to reports, Nguyen’s posts received upwards of 45,000 likes.

Since 2017, Vietnam has been escalating its arrests of bloggers and social media activists who criticise the government or draw attention to environmental issues.

Nguyen’s conviction brought condemnation from the European Union, which released a statement through their foreign service stating: “Nguyen Ngoc Anh’s right to peaceful freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Vietnamese constitution.”

Amnesty International said the “sham trial” was just the latest evidence that Vietnam’s repressive communist government was increasing its chokehold on civil society by targeting posts on Facebook.

Nicholas Bequelin, a regional director at Amnesty International, said: “The sham charges levelled against Nguyen Ngoc Anh show that no one is safe on Facebook in Vietnam any more. Anh is only the last case in a growing list of netizens prosecuted, arrested or detained solely for peacefully discussing public affairs or criticising the government.”

An estimated 55 million people in Vietnam use social media regularly, ranking seventh in the world for social media engagement, but it is governed by restrictions similar to those in China limiting freedom of expression online.

As part of a draconian new cybersecurity law that came into effect in January this year, Facebook, Google and other technology firms are required to locally store “important” personal data on users in Vietnam, which they then have to hand over to the government.

The Vietnam government accused Facebook of violating the law this year by allowing users to post anti-government sentiments on the site.","European Union criticises imprisonment of Nguyen Ngoc Anh, saying he has right to peaceful freedom of expressionVietnam blogger jailed for six years for Facebook posts calling for peaceful protestsAn environmental activist has been jailed for six years in Vietnam for “anti-state” Facebook posts, as part of the country’s continuing crackdown on social media.

70,Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema – ranked!,Ryan Gilbey,"Keanu Reeves’s cameo in Netflix’s Always Be My Maybe – as himself, yet absolutely ghastly – is a showstopper. But what about those other stars who have parodied themselves on screen?

10. Al Pacino in Jack and Jill (2011)



The collision of high and low culture that occurred when Al Pacino appeared as himself in Adam Sandler’s lamentable cross-dressing comedy must have been visible from space. Pacino falls in love with Sandler in drag but the sorest indignity comes when he rechristens himself Dunkaccino to star in a Dunkin’ Donuts commercial in which he raps mangled lines from Dog Day Afternoon, The Godfather Part II and Scarface (“Say hello to my chocolate blend”).

9. Cate Blanchett in Coffee and Cigarettes (2003)



Jim Jarmusch’s portmanteau film features various celebrities from music and cinema, among them Alfred Molina being fobbed off by Steve Coogan (in an early instance of the comic playing himself prior to A Cock and Bull Story and The Trip). Blanchett gives an intriguing double-performance as both herself and her own cousin, Shelly, who resents Blanchett’s glamorous life, in an episode that demonstrates the actor’s effortless versatility.

8. Elisabeth Shue in Hamlet 2 (2008)



Ever wondered what happened to the star of Leaving Las Vegas, Cocktail and Adventures in Babysitting? Turns out she jacked it all in to become a nurse in a Tucson fertility clinic. That’s the conceit of this comedy starring Steve Coogan as a pretentious drama teacher with delusions of talent. “I got sick of the business, sick of all the horrible people,” Shue explains when he recognises her. “It’s all about being a fucking celebrity now.”

7. Michael Cera in This Is the End (2013)



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Cera in This is the End

Michael Cera already had experience playing Michael Cera in Paper Heart. But he ditched his winsome, milk-and-cookies persona spectacularly for the apocalyptic celeb-fest This Is the End, in which he gropes Rihanna, snorts cocaine and has a bathroom threesome. “Michael was just ready to fucking rock,” said the co-writer and co-director Evan Goldberg. “All the other actors knew he was probably going to be the one who stole the movie.”

6. Keanu Reeves in Always Be My Maybe (2019)



Stories abound of Keanu Reeves’s widespread beneficence, which only makes his auto-cameo as a self-satisfied bore in this Asian-American Netflix romcom all the more delicious. Sitting down in a restaurant, he asks the waiter: “Do you have any dishes that play with time? The concept of time?” Then he sobs as he eats venison while listening on headphones to the sounds of the deer in happier times. He also settles the table’s $6,400 bill (“Less than a residuals paycheque for my hit movie Speed”), shows off his knowledge of Chinese dignitaries and claims that his childhood crush was Mother Teresa.

5. Most of French cinema in Grosse Fatigue (1994)



This comedy by the actor-writer-director Michel Blanc won the screenplay prize at Cannes and deserves recognition for its ingenuity and prescience in blurring the life/film divide, with the likes of Charlotte Gainsbourg, Carole Bouquet and Philippe Noiret playing themselves. But if the movie was in poor taste in 1994, it looks excruciating now. Blanc, as Blanc, is chagrined to find he has been accused of crimes trivial (blagging Gérard Depardieu’s hotel suite) to heinous (raping the actor Josiane Balasko). If the revelation that there is an imposter in his midst – also played by Blanc – scarcely sweetens the pill, the presence of Roman Polanski may make it downright unpalatable to modern viewers.

4. Bill Murray in Zombieland (2009)



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bill Murray in Zombieland

One of the few blips on Bill Murray’s CV is the 2004 Garfield movie, for which he provided the voice of the languorous feline. Murray signed up for it in the mistaken belief that the script was by one of the Coen brothers (close: Joel Cohen, writer of Daddy Day Camp, had a hand in it). Still, it was worth the error when he got the chance to play himself in the comedy-horror Zombieland. Asked on his deathbed whether he has any regrets, he sighs: “Garfield, maybe?” Perhaps in the upcoming Zombieland follow-up he will reveal why he went on to appear also in the Garfield sequel.

3. Anna Faris in Keanu (2016)



The joy of Anna Faris’s cameo as a drug-crazed, samurai-sword-wielding psychopath in this Key and Peele vehicle lies in our initial assumption that she is playing a role. Only once she is complimented for her work in The House Bunny does the penny drop. The director Peter Atencio told her: “Don’t play a different person, but do play what you would be like if you were insane and doing a bunch of blow.” It’s just one scene but the pleasures are twisted and numerous, from Faris trying to convince Tiffany Haddish to shoot Jordan Peele (“Come on, show us what death looks like!”) to Peele begging for his life: “This is black-on-black violence! Don’t fucking let Anna Faris tear us apart!”

2. Joaquin Phoenix in I’m Still Here (2010)



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joaquin Phoenix in I’m Still Here

Separated from the accusations of sexual harassment levelled during production at its director Casey Affleck, I’m Still Here represents a staggering feat of orchestration. Joaquin Phoenix really did capsize his career temporarily by becoming a mumbling, bearded wreck and announcing his retirement from acting to focus on rapping. (Spoiler: he couldn’t rap.) The whole thing was a wheeze that lasted more than a year, all for the purposes of this mockumentary. Part of the fun is seeing the mischief spill over into reality: the car-crash interview with David Letterman, or Ben Stiller mocking Phoenix at the 2009 Oscars. The film is let down only by a limited emotional range that permits its star to be a nitwit or a boor and nothing in between.

1. John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich (1999)



Facebook Twitter Pinterest “Malkovich?” Watch John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich

Charlie Kaufman’s mind-boggling screenplay marked the first time the concept of auto-performance had been put so squarely, and so bizarrely, at the centre of an entire movie. John Cusack is the office worker who discovers behind a filing cabinet a portal leading into the head of John Malkovich; anyone who ventures inside can enjoy a full 15 minutes of seeing the world through the actor’s eyes before being dumped unceremoniously next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Malkovich’s essence, combining the recognisability factor with a highfalutin haughtiness, is crucial; Being Tom Cruise wouldn’t have had the same effect, but then nor would Being Frank Langella. “It was never going to be anybody other than Malkovich,” Kaufman confirmed. The film’s reach and influence has been wide and eclectic – Paul Giamatti (in Cold Souls) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (in JCVD) are among those to have been Malkoviched – yet the film stands bald-head and shoulders above the rest, every bit as seductively peculiar as Malkovich himself.","Blanchett gives an intriguing double-performance as both herself and her own cousin, Shelly, who resents Blanchett’s glamorous life, in an episode that demonstrates the actor’s effortless versatility.

71,The heat is on: how to make the feelgood hit of the summer,Kate Solomon,"The warmer months have replaced Christmas as pop’s key battleground. But what strange alchemy brings about a Shotgun or Despacito, and who are this year’s contenders?

The heat is on: how to make the feelgood hit of the summer

The heat is on: how to make the feelgood hit of the summer

As the days get longer, a strange phenomenon occurs. Everything you do becomes soundtracked by one seemingly omnipresent melody, one incessant beat. You might pride yourself on not knowing what it is, but it will prevail regardless. This is the song of the summer.

In 2013 it was the relentless funk of Daft Punk’s Get Lucky. In 2003 Beyoncé was inescapably Crazy in Love with Jay-Z; and 1999 rang with Lou Bega’s shopping list of lovers, Mambo No 5. Last year, in the UK at least, it was a three-way tie between Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa’s One Kiss, Drake’s God’s Plan and George Ezra’s Shotgun. Those three songs went on to become the three biggest sellers of the year and, in Ezra’s case at least, led to lucrative festival headline bookings this summer.

In the UK, the biggest music sales period traditionally used to be the run-up to Christmas, both for albums (as gifts) and singles (in the race for Christmas No 1). But as we purchase less music directly and swing behind streaming, the summer, stretching from as early as April to late September, is much more lucrative. “It’s genuinely difficult now to have a ‘new’ Christmas hit: the playlist-heavy patterns of streaming mean the classics are played heavily,” says Stuart Dredge, editor at music-industry publication Music Ally. “Who’d go up against Mariah?”

In broadcasting, too, the summer is considered a more exciting time of the year for music. “For us at Radio 1, it’s always felt that summer songs were more important than Christmas songs,” says Radio 1 and 1Xtra’s head of music, Chris Price. “I think that’s because young people own the summer.” School and university ends, it’s festival season and time for holidays. The summer months have an intensity that the rest of the year lacks, and any record that can sum up that elusive feeling is destined for a permanent place in listeners’ hearts.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Carly Rae Jepsen’s 2012 sumer hit Cal Me Maybe.

So what can prospective summertime songwriters do to optimise their chances of a hit as the mercury rises? An aura of end-of-term excitement is a good start. “I’m constantly trying to capture summer feelings,” explains Carly Rae Jepsen, she of the 18m-selling Call Me Maybe (song of the summer 2012). “I’ll be like: ‘The chorus needs to lift so it’s like you’ve got the wind in your hair and you’re on a rollercoaster and running to the top of the mountain!’ and they’re like, ‘OK …’”

Yet a summer tune need not be as light and hooky as Call Me Maybe. Billie Eilish’s Bad Guy couldn’t be moodier yet it feels as though it could seep into the long shadows of muggy evenings. “The key ingredient is a massive, simple chorus, easy to jump to in a field somewhere,” says Beats 1 host Matt Wilkinson. “But it doesn’t always have to be Good Vibrations or the most obvious summery song. It can be a dark song.”

Making a summer anthem was an aspiration: a song heard in every car, every block party, every barbecue, every schoolyard Craig Kallman

With the global appetite for Latin music from reggaeton to salsa seeming insatiable, its rhythms are more of an asset than ever. This year, Sech’s Otro Trago and Lunay’s Soltera are set to be the songs of 2019’s summer in Latin America; and because we Brits associate Latin culture with sunshine, it’s the optimum time for them to cross over here, too.

Craig Kallman, CEO of Atlantic Records, produced Cardi B’s 2018 summer hit I Like It. He spent seven months considering the “incredible danceable, rhythmic party nature of Latin music” to make something summer-perfect, built around a sample from Pete Rodriguez’s I Like It Like That, pulled from his 750,000-strong record collection. I Like It seems even more precision engineered for summertime success than most such hits, featuring not only Cardi B, whose popularity and goodwill was peaking, but also Bad Bunny and J Balvin, two of Latin pop’s biggest stars. “Making one of those summertime anthems was certainly an aspiration,” Kallman says. “Thinking that this could be one of those records that’s played and heard in every car driving down the block, every block party, every backyard barbecue, every schoolyard, as well as being a nightclub anthem.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Cardi B’s 2018 summer hit I Like It Like That.

In 2016 another Latin hit, Luis Fonsi’s unstoppable Despacito, became huge on its own considerable merits in the Americas, but earned its British success off its Spanish-language exoticism; listening to it felt like going on a summer holiday of the mind. Such records are doubly potent if you throw in a novelty element, such as Las Ketchup’s The Ketchup Song (Aserejé) and Los Del Rio’s immortal Macarena, both of which sparked global dance crazes in 2002 and 1995 respectively. This year, Daddy Yankee’s Con Calma, which interpolates Canadian rapper Snow’s 1992 track Informer, seems to tick this particular box.

“The songs that typically stand out as potential songs of the summer often have a novelty factor,” says Jon Klein, who works on pop playlists at Apple Music. “But not necessarily in a bad way. The novelty is that they’re unique sounding and seemingly emerge out of nowhere.”

Timing is everything. Ezra’s Shotgun was intended to be the lead single from his 2018 album Staying at Tamara’s, but his record company deliberately held it back in order to hit as summer began, when that “underneath the hot sun” lyric might make sense, even under unpredictable British skies. “We were originally looking at the single coming out in January,” says Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, Ezra’s A&R, “and I was like: ‘There’s no way that we’re doing that.’ We got a great note from Ed Sheeran going: ‘Bloody hell, why is that record not out now?’” In the end, the song was pushed to radio and TV in May when it was already a fan favourite. It spent 12 weeks in the top 3 and is still in the UK top 50. “There’s no evil, twisted marketing engineering,” says Unger-Hamilton. “We didn’t buy a campaign with a suntan lotion company or anything. It was the right artist on the right campaign at the right time.”

Old Town Road will be the song of festivals this year. At campsites, people will start singing it at 6am Matt Wilkinson

Ezra is an established artist with a legion of listeners ready to lap up his folk-pop gap-year tales; if you are a newer artist, it might pay to unleash your bid for summer ubiquity a bit earlier. “We’re constantly planning,” says Price of Radio 1 and 1Xtra’s music policy. “We’ll work maybe three to six months out.”

For streaming playlist success, it also helps to give listeners a longer lead time. “If it’s a new artist or an emerging sound, it can take months to reach the summit,” Klein confirms. Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road, a song that most commentators agree has the potential to be this summer’s definitive song, was first released in December. It found its feet by hopping on savvy hashtags on the Gen-Z video app TikTok, tapped into not one but two current trends (country and trap), and really caught on in the UK after Billy Ray Cyrus appeared on a remix to growl about Fendi sports bras. “That’ll be the song of festivals this year,” Wilkinson reckons. “At campsites, people will start singing it at 6am.”

Could a changing pop landscape undermine the definitive song of the summer, though? With streaming and social media levelling the landscape, we are likely to have more years like 2018, where no one song dominates. This fragmenting of our collective cultural experience prompted Rolling Stone to declare that the song of the summer no longer exists, replaced instead by a playlist’s worth of tracks favoured by different demographics.

This is partly because radio cannot necessarily make or break a song in the way it could 20 years ago. The process has become much more fragmented and having your song added to the right streaming playlist can be just as important. “Before, I think you could engineer it: right artist, right song, right support, right timing, everything,” say Zane Lowe, global creative director at Apple Music. “Now, with streaming, there are no guarantees. Even the biggest artists can come back now with a song that on paper, and when you hear it, you think is a complete no brainer. But then it’s like: ‘Why is it sitting at No 6 on the chart?’”

The final ingredient, then, is some kind of alchemy. “We really didn’t know!” says Jepsen of her global megasmash. And despite the months of hard labour that went into Cardi’s I Like It, Kallman could never be sure it would land. “I just felt like we had something special and magical,” he says. “You can never predict what is going to ultimately happen.”

So what will be the song – or rather the songs – of summer this year? Behind the scenes, they will have been honed and prepared like so many beach bodies, but it will take far more than that, some ineffable magic, to truly make them shine.

Song of the summer 2019: the contenders

Meduza – Piece of Your Heart (feat Goodboys)

By pairing one melody nicked from another previous summer smash by David Guetta with a chorus designed to be chanted in cheap swimwear, this deep house roller is 2019’s poolside anthem of choice.

Blinkie – Little Love (feat Grace Tither)

Every summer needs a totally generic, HD-polished piano house track to soundtrack the more carefree montages in Love Island, and this is 2019’s, hoisted aloft by a piercingly catchy chorus. See also: Tiësto, Jonas Blue and Rita Ora’s Ritual.

India Jordan – DNT STP MY LV

Destined to instil complete pandemonium at all summer festivals is this high-tempo dance track built around a Todd Edwards-style cut-up vocal sample; pure UV radiation in music.

Luca Hänni – She Got Me

With its reggaeton beat and Major Lazer-style sirens, Switzerland’s Eurovision entry already invites tequila shots with strangers – and its “dirty dancing!” chorus will ensure the year’s most ill-advised holiday romances.

Lizzo – Truth Hurts

Juice was the big single, but this track from the Minneapolis rapper is slow-burning its way onto everyone’s summer playlists thanks to its constant punchlines and catchy chorus kiss-off.

G-Eazy – West Coast (feat Blueface)

It’s a toss-up between this, DaBaby’s Suge and YG’s Go Loko for the slow, low-riding rap track to play out of your car to pretend you’re rolling through LA while negotiating a sofa-warehouse car park.

Stardust – Music Sounds Better With You

The summer smash of 1998 has been depressingly absent from streaming services and YouTube, but it will finally arrive on 28 June to enthral a new generation with its Chaka Khan-sampling genius.

Dalex – Pa Mí (Remix feat Rafa Pabön, Khea, Sech, Feid, Cazzu & Lenny Tavárez)

Well, it won’t do a Despacito, but this is the warm-evening Latin hit of the year, with an extremely sensual top line; taken from the album Climaxxx, whose title tells you exactly what it is designed for.

Steve Lacy – Playground

The way the slap bass and jangling guitars combine in the opening 20 seconds of this song are the most summery thing imaginable, and Lacy’s falsetto vocal continues to keep the clouds at bay.

Miley Cyrus – Party Up the Street (feat Swae Lee & Mike WiLL Made-It)

Time was that a Miley Cyrus song called Party Up the Street would have namechecked molly and featured LMFAO, but this slowly pulsating track is admirably restrained – you can feel the heat rising as if from evening tarmac.

72,Was I in denial? Margo Jefferson on Michael Jackson's legacy,Margo Jefferson,"How does a critic and fan come to terms with the fall of an icon? Ten years after his death, the Pulitzer-winning writer revisits her book on Michael Jackson and confronts her own denial

In the first year of the 21st century my American editor and I sat in a restaurant talking about Michael Jackson. We hailed his uncanny brilliance and mourned it too – 30 years of making music, dance, film; crisscrossing styles, genres, types and tropes; confounding cultural codes. We brooded over the rumours and scandals that were turning him into an object of derision, even revulsion. We wanted, we said, to give him his due before (my editor’s words) “he self-destructs … Before he’s destroyed,” my editor qualified, “and self-destructs.”

Events moved too quickly: I couldn’t finish the book before he was arrested in 2003. He was indicted in 2004; he was found not guilty in 2005; he was found dead of an accidental drug overdose in June 2009. We hoped death would restore the measure of his greatness as an artist.

In the quiet, sombre documentary Leaving Neverland, released earlier this year, two young men in their 30s look into a camera and describe the childhood years in which they had sex with Jackson. They use that flat phrase, “had sex”, and they describe, almost wonderingly, how much they loved him, even worshipped him. They make us understand how often and how much sexual abuse depends on a child’s looking up to a powerful adult: trusting, needing, maybe loving that adult. Molestation and abuse are harsh unambiguous words, but we can’t fully understand them unless we understand that they are often inseparable from the lures and ambiguities of seduction. These feelings get all mixed up in a child’s mind and body. So we must not separate the acts and the aura of seduction from the acts and aura of abuse. Jackson was a cultural deity. And of course these boys were thrilled to be in his presence: millions of people – twice, thrice and four times their age – were thrilled to have him in their presence, if only via computer screens, concert stadiums and memorabilia. Imagine meeting Jackson face to face. Imagine being the child whom a god chooses as his favourite.

To any child, there is something of the god about every powerful grownup – be they parent, mentor, patron or counsellor. Wade Robson and James Safechuck were child performers from ordinary families. The Jacksons had once been an ordinary family and world fame had chosen them through Michael: now Michael was choosing their children. He visited their modest homes; he watched TV, goofed around and ate popcorn with them. The families were besotted. He brought them all gifts and took them on trips. He offered them a fairytale of upward mobility. The Jacksons had lived that fairytale – why shouldn’t they? He made the families feel special. He made the boys feel loved. Did he love them? Within the confines of his damaged, damaging soul, I imagine he did. We like to think we love with all that’s good in us. But we love just as fiercely with all that’s bad in us. “Childhood is the fiery furnace in which we are melted down to essentials and that essential shaped for good,” wrote Katherine Anne Porter. She should have added two more words. She should have added “and ill”.

In the video for a song he wrote and titled “Childhood” Jackson sits in a lush green forest, clad in white, and sings softly and longingly to the camera:

It’s been my fate to compensate, For the Childhood I’ve never known Before you judge me, try hard to love me The painful youth I’ve had …

It’s our fate now to reread his videos and song lyrics, probing for coded confessions. “Have you seen my childhood?” he asks twice, in sad, sweet, boy-soprano tones. In a court of law it could be his plea for exoneration. For in fact we know a lot about Jackson’s childhood. We know what it cost him to be the family’s ticket out of poverty and obscurity.

We know he was beaten and psychologically tormented by his father, Joseph. According to persistent rumours he was sexually molested by at least one adult in the music business. So yes, we can say that, like Robson and Safechuck, he could not free himself from his experience of childhood abuse.

The son who kept surgically cutting away at his face partly because he didn’t want to look like his father did not cut away this legacy of abuse: he passed it on

Instead, he recreated it. What began with Joseph Jackson was passed on by Michael Joseph Jackson. The son who kept surgically cutting away at his face partly because he didn’t want to look like his father did not cut away this legacy of abuse: he passed it on to another generation of boys. A tragic tale and a horrifying one. The predator-seducer pretending to be the pure-hearted protector of innocent children everywhere. I say pretending – and Michael was a peerless performer – but I think he also longed to be the pure-hearted protector of children’s innocence. That longing gave his pretence an uncanny power for a long time. It’s a power he still exerts over the masses of fans whose feverish rebuttals and teeth-bared denunciations can be found online.

The vulnerable genius was also the calculating paedophile. That’s what we must reckon with now, what we must refuse to simplify.

¶

Jackson, one of the 20th century’s greatest – most exhilarating, innovative and influential – popular artists was first accused of the sexual abuse of Jordan Chandler in 1993. He was 35 years old. A financial settlement was agreed. Ten years later, in 2003, he was arrested and charged with sexually molesting another boy, Gavin Arvizo. The 15-week trial that began on 28 February 2005 was an immersive and clamorous multimedia spectacle. Everything Jackson owned, from his penis to his art collection, was examined and photographed by the Santa Barbara police department. Reports on their findings, some official, some leaked, went global. The trial was televised daily with frenetic commentary. Eighteen months and 21 days after his arrest Jackson was found not guilty of all charges.

Timeline Michael Jackson child sexual abuse claims Show Hide LAPD investigation After Jordan Chandler makes allegations during a police interview that Jackson has abused him, an investigation begins. Jackson had met the 12-year-old boy the previous year. Barnes and Robson press conference Teenagers Brett Barnes and Wade Robson hold a press conference stating that they had shared a bed with Jackson on multiple occasions, but that nothing sexual had happened. Chandlers sue Jackson A lawsuit from the Chandler family alleges sexual abuse by Jackson and seeks $30m. Jackson video statement Jackson describes being strip-searched and photographed by the LAPD two days earlier as “the most humiliating ordeal of my life”. He states: ""I am not guilty of these allegations, but if I am guilty of anything it is of giving all that I have to give to help children all over the world.” Jackson settles lawsuit Jackson settles out of court with the Chandlers for $22m – $15m goes to Jordan Chandler to be held in a trust fund until he turns 18. LAPD investigation fails After two grand juries fail to indict, and Jordan Chandler tells authorities he will not testify in court, the Los Angeles and Santa Barbara district attorneys end their investigation. Scream released The lead single from Jackson’s album HIStory is released. A duet with his sister Janet, the song angrily addresses media coverage of the child sexual abuse allegations against him.

Bashir documentary Jackson discusses regularly having sleepovers with children, including a young cancer patient named Gavin Arvizo, in Living with Michael Jackson – a documentary fronted by the British journalist Martin Bashir. ""It's not sexual,"" said Jackson on-screen. ""We’re going to sleep. I tuck them in. It's very charming."" The film rekindles police investigations. Police raid and arrest Jackson's Neverland estate is again searched by police, and a week later Jackson is arrested. Jackson charged Michael Jackson is formally charged with committing lewd and lascivious acts with a child under the age of 14. Trial begins During Jackson's trial, Arvizo and his younger brother testify that the singer showed them pornography and made them drink ""Jesus juice"" – wine. Both say Jackson masturbated in front of them and molested Arvizo on multiple occasions. Blanca Francia, one of Jackson's former housekeepers, testifies she saw Jackson showering with Wade Robson. Witnesses for the defence, including Macaulay Culkin and Robson, say that Jackson never molested them. Not guilty verdict The jury finds Jackson not guilty on all 14 charges brought against him. Jackson dies In the run-up to This Is It, a planned residency at London's O2 Arena, Jackson dies age 50 of a cardiac arrest. Wade Robson sues Wade Robson takes legal action against the Jackson estate, alleging that Michael Jackson molested him over a seven-year period between the ages of seven and 14. James Safechuck sues Safechuck alleges Jackson abused him on more than 100 occasions after the pair met when Safechuck appeared in a Pepsi commercial alongside the singer. Leaving Neverland Dan Reed's four-hour documentary Leaving Neverland opens at the Sundance film festival. In it Wade Robson and James Safechuck discuss at length the abuse they claim they suffered at Jackson's hands. It is described as ""a public lynching"" by Jackson's surviving family. Television screenings Leaving Neverland is shown on the HBO network in the US, with a UK screening on Channel 4 on 6 and 7 March. The Jackson estate sue HBO for $100m, claiming the network is in breach of a non-disparagement clause in a 1992 contract. Radio ban Radio stations around the world, including in New Zealand and Canada, begin to pull Jackson's music from the airwaves.

But being found not guilty by a court is a far cry from public exoneration. He had been disgraced. He was in debt. He made people squeamish. His record sales wavered and dipped. Nothing was beyond the shadow of any sort of doubt. Supporters insisted that the financial settlement was his only way of avoiding further exploitation. Doubters and opponents pointed out that surely more investigation was needed: there had been lawsuits, multiple rumours and Jackson’s unabashed admission that he shared his bed with boys. He couldn’t be tried again. The case moved to the court of public opinion.

And he moved about like exiled royalty – Bahrain, Las Vegas – plagued by debt, dependent on the hospitality of royals and moguls. He became an iconic figure in celebrity scandal-and-downfall narratives. There was the male sexual downfall narrative, which took in 20th-century stars from Fatty Arbuckle to Roman Polanski, Jerry Lee Lewis to Chuck Berry. There was the drugs and body disfigurement narrative, represented by Elvis Presley and by every ageing female star mocked for addiction problems and cosmetic surgeries. He was all but expunged from journalism’s official narratives of pop innovation and glory.

When I wrote my book I was grieving for Michael Jackson the artist. The uncanny little boy; the charismatic, slightly mournful young man, the shape-shifting child-man-woman-cyborg-extraterrestrial. The cultural polyglot who studied – mastered, gloried in – so many styles and traditions; one to whom no form of popular music and dance was alien.

I was grieving and I was confounded. Jackson’s acts and actions were like hieroglyphics we kept trying to decipher. We – for I was a fan, too – wanted him to explain himself in a way that could restore our trust. Child stars make us believe we understand them, that there’s mutual trust between us. We were baffled by our collective memory of Jackson the loving, lovable child who was now shutting himself off from us.

I was relieved, I was grateful when he died. He can get it all back with his art now, I thought. We can glory in that. And we did. Death restored his reputation as an artist. In the years that followed his grisly 2009 death – the overdose, the frantic attempts at CPR, the corpse in the body bag, the lurid autopsy details – there was a Jackson renaissance. Pop, jazz, and hip‑hop musicians adapted and sampled his songs; two generations of dancers recycled and recharged his moves. Multiple ways of reading his art sprang up and flourished. Academics began reading him through deconstruction, post-colonial and queer theory; performance, gender and cultural studies. He became the avatar of a transracial, transgender and trans-species world.

But now, 10 years after his death, Leaving Neverland has placed new demands on us. Am I chagrined and shamed that when I wrote my book I couldn’t push myself to acknowledge that this damaged man was almost certainly a sexual predator? Of course I am. As a critic I’m invested in believing I’m not in the grip of naivety or denial. I tell myself that at least I wasn’t alone. A lawyer friend observed recently that in the 1980s and 90s the sexual abuse of children was still (his words) a black hole in the culture’s consciousness. That black hole had a fierce gravitational pull: we circled around it, but we did not peer down it to deepen our knowledge of its social reach and psychological intricacies.

The crises that have created #MeToo and similar movements show how little we knew and how little we chose to know about … what’s the range of words? Sexual harassment, exploitation, molestation, assault and abuse, across all divisions of class, gender, race, ethnicity, religion and age. We know that few of the victims, perpetrators or complicit bystanders are famous. The famous ones can turn the story into a public tragedy that stirs our pity and terror. But no catharsis is available.

What happens now? Some people say they need to “cancel” Jackson, stop listening to him, stop watching him for a time. Some radio stations and streaming services have done just that. Fashion houses have withdrawn clothes that bear his image or (too obviously) his influence; statues have been pulled down in several European countries. But these are short-term actions.

In the meantime, Robson and Safechuck have sued the Michael Jackson estate, and in response the estate has denounced them and sued HBO for $100m. Like many, I am rooting for these men to win any legal and financial recompense they possibly can. Such recompense is usually the only form of public justice available to sexual abuse victims.

Finally, there are long-term cultural questions that plague us, questions about the relation between art and life. Usually, these questions take the form of: can we, should we separate the life from the work? And how would we do this? Can we grapple with these questions and not hide behind old-school simplifications? According to these simplifications:

1) We must not separate the life from the work because history has shown that the art will inevitably reflect the corruptions of the life. (This is usually followed by a list of the ethical and political ills that art can wreak on society.)

2) We must separate them because art is on the side of freedom; it offers beauties and pleasures that transcend the confines of moral disapproval. (This is usually followed by a list of major artists who have lived their lives as fascists, Nazis, misogynists or white supremacists while producing major art.)

Art versus life is too simple. Are we talking about our personal opinions and judgments of the art and the life? Or do we mean opinions shaped by social systems, by law, politics and history? We need the intelligence and the will to make these distinctions – in ourselves, not just in the art we choose. What makes us love or hate an artist? What makes us love and hate an artist, feel pleasure and unease, confusion and bliss all at once? What private needs and longings do we each bring to the work we love? When the dark materials of a life pervade, even taint the work, does that mean we must cast it off? It might mean that, but it might also mean that we fight for the parts of it that matter to us. We gather our resources in all their plenitude and variety: intellectual, emotional, moral; aesthetic, political. And we use them to analyse and demystify the work, to probe its clashes and contradictions, feel their power without being at their mercy. No evasions, no simplifications. The task is to read the art and the life fully as they wind and unwind around each other, changing shape and direction.

73,Since U been on: will Kelly Clarkson succeed as a talkshow host?,Issy Sampson,"Huge news: Kelly Clarkson is getting a chatshow. Which is amazing: she is literally the pop star we would all like to have a long chat on the sofa with. Kelly, who is also a coach on The Voice US, described filming the series as “really fun”, adding: “I just love communication, and I think there’s a lot of brokenness with that in the world right now; there’s just so much division. I want my show to be really inclusive.” No UK broadcaster has picked it up as yet, but it launches in September in the US and it will air “right before Ellen [DeGeneres’s chatshow]” according to Kelly. No pressure, then.

But musicians don’t exactly have a great track record when it comes to hosting chatshows. The format has a habit of going off the rails when put in the hands of singers. In 2006, Channel 4 decided that “being a bit mouthy in interviews” meant Charlotte Church needed her own chatshow called … The Charlotte Church Show. Clearly, someone had told her to be as outrageous as she could, because she slapped Johnny Vegas live on air, kicked off a chat with an uneasy Hilary Duff by showing her a picture of Paris and Nicky Hilton, asking what she thought of “those fame-hungry tarts”, and cackled about Peter Andre’s “massive” penis with Katie Price. She quit after three series.

Weirdly, that didn’t put TV bosses off signing up more pop stars for chatshows. Remember the slow-motion car crash that was BBC Three’s Lily Allen and Friends? Cancelled after one series, the format was weird (the audience was made up of Lily’s MySpace friends, because 2008) and Lily struggled to show even a flicker of interest in her guests, including one week, the confusing combination of Cuba Gooding Jr and David Mitchell. Lily’s natural speaking voice is quite monotone and she was tasked with awkwardly worded questions such as: “In your new film you get off with Penélope Cruz – was she a good kisser?” to the likes of Martin Freeman while lying on a bed. According to one report in the Sun, she “pulled her boob out and played with it for three minutes” while interviewing Paddy McGuinness.

At the end of the day, Kelly’s success or failure will all come down to one thing: is she interested in her guests? It might sound obvious, but good celebs-turned-chatshow-hosts actually care about the answers to their questions (see: Chelsea Handler) and the bad ones fail because they don’t (see: Khloé Kardashian struggling to find common ground with any guest she’s not directly related to on her short-lived show Kocktails With Khloé). Kelly is incredibly watchable on The Voice, but will she be able to translate that warmness and curiosity to a talkshow format? Don’t worry, Kelly: if it all goes wrong, at least you won’t have attacked a guest or got your boob out on TV.","Huge news: Kelly Clarkson is getting a chatshow.

74,Out of tune: why Miley Cyrus' Black Mirror episode hits the wrong note,Stuart Heritage,"The new season of Charlie Brooker’s Netflix series stumbles with its Vox Lux-lite fantasy about a singer who gets turned into an Amazon Echo. Major spoilers ahead

The new season of Black Mirror succeeds most the further it strays from traditional Black Mirror territory. Smithereens is a gripping modern-day hostage drama, albeit one with a moral that’s basically your mum telling you off at the dinner table. Striking Vipers takes the oldest Black Mirror trope – the button on the side of your head – and shepherds it into a pleasingly human avenue.

Black Mirror: the five best episodes so far Read more

And then there’s Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, one of the Black Mirroriest Black Mirrors to ever Black Mirror, which means it’s easily the worst episode of the three. In fact, it might be one of the worst episodes in the show’s entire catalogue.

Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too tells two converging stories. In one, Miley Cyrus – playing Miley Cyrus if Miley Cyrus really hated smiling – is sidelined by her grasping manager’s new technology. And in the other, more hellish twist, Cyrus’s entire personality is downloaded on to an Amazon Echo.

Imagine that for a second. Imagine having that in your home. Imagine if Cyrus wasn’t just Alexa, but Alexa with a face who could follow you around as she went about borrowing all the exact cadences of a full-tilt Chucky doll. That’s the real nightmare, isn’t it? In a parallel universe, this episode ends in the manner of other Black Mirrors, with humanity realising too late the perils of putting Cyrus in an Amazon Echo, and everyone slashing their throats in the shower in slow motion while Exit Music (For a Film) plays in the background and the Cyrus Alexa continues to jibber incoherently outside their bathroom doors.

However, the one thing that Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too has going for it – and this more or less goes for the entire season – is that Charlie Brooker has dropped his penchant for mindless nihilism. These aren’t pointlessly bleak for the sake of it. Nobody kills a baby with a hammer. No paedophiles get hunted down and murdered by vigilantes. At no point does a relentless army of unstoppable robot dogs threaten to end mankind as we know it.

Here, to differing extents, we get three variations on a happy ending. A character meets a sticky end, but only after finding closure. A couple gives up something precious but rescues their marriage in the process. However, in the case of Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, the happy ending inexplicably takes the form of Cyrus starting to enjoy guitars.

And this is the episode’s real problem. Its big point – that young creatives are at the mercy of their morally bankrupt handlers – has already been done to absolute death, cropping up in A Star is Born, Vox Lux and Yesterday in the last few months alone. But when Cyrus manages to break free of this, she does so in a way that’s stupid enough to give you a headache.

Black Mirror season five review – sweet, sadistic and hugely impressive Read more

The whole episode carries the damp stench of a “real music” aficionado; it’s full of corduroy and warm ale, David-Bowie-would-never-win-X-Factor, pub-bore browbeating. The Cyrus we meet at the start of the episode makes manufactured pop that’s slick, well-made, personal (her lyrics come directly from her dream diary) and popular. She is very, very good at this. But by the end she has become, for want of a better word, Nickelback. She starts shouting very bad, very witless, completely anonymous grunge-lite songs back to back with her bassist (who has a nose ring, because attitude). She’s happy, but only because she’s adopted a hard shell of “authenticity” that’s arguably even more constrictive than her former persona.

Brooker’s progress as a writer has been startling. When he wrote Dead Set, his characters tended to sound exactly as if they were all just reading out Brooker newspaper columns, but over the course of Black Mirror he has shown how incredibly gifted he is at permeating his voice into any number of situations. The American characters he writes sound convincingly American. The teenage characters he writes sound convincingly teenage. But Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too feels like a step backwards.

When Cyrus ditches the trappings of success to follow her inner rock star – when she basically follows the exact career path of Paul Cattermole leaving S Club 7 to form Skua – she stops sounding like Miley Cyrus and starts sounding like a 48-year-old man trying to sound like Miley Cyrus. It’s one of the first times that Black Mirror has sounded genuinely out of touch. Hopefully it’s just a misstep.","Major spoilers aheadThe new season of Black Mirror succeeds most the further it strays from traditional Black Mirror territory.

75,"Tales of the City review – a queer classic returns, flawed but often fabulous",Chitra Ramaswamy,"How much has San Francisco changed since the 60s? This is the question posed to Anna Madrigal – ANNA MADRIGAL! – in the opening frames of Netflix’s Tales of the City reboot. “Hmmm,” replies the original house mother, straight to camera, in that fabulously bone-dry, bone-loving slooooow tone that only Olympia Dukakis – OLYMPIA DUKAKIS! – can pull off. “Not much actually. We’re still people aren’t we? Flawed, narcissistic and doing our best.”

As for Lauren Morelli’s respectful reimagining of Tales of the City, executive produced by Armistead Maupin and the result of an all-queer writers’ room, it’s … flawed, narcissistic and doing its best. Sometimes it’s doing its best a bit too hard, which I guess is to be expected when the stakes are this high and the original – both books and mini-series – this fiercely loved. After all, Tales of the City remains the first proper home of generations of LGBT+ people. Our very own 28 Barbary Lane located in the spacious, open-aspected, radical mind of Maupin. This matters.

Happily, lots of it feels right. It’s 20 years on and we’re back at Barbary Lane, which according to the consumer law of sequels is considerably bigger (Escher levels of decking, stairs and, erm, fairy lights), more aspirational and less fabulous than the original. It’s Anna’s 90th birthday party and Mary Ann Singleton (Laura Linney), the prodigal straight, anally retentive daughter, returns to San Francisco older, sadder, no wiser and just as square as ever. “I tried Googling what to wear to a 90-year-old’s birthday party in San Francisco and pictures of Cher kept coming up,” she wails, pitching up in a Next-level tea dress to the queer shindig of the century. Which is also too self-consciously hip and moneyed. She comes with a dodgy conventional husband in tow, a barely closeted homophobe who by the end of the first episode is daring her to go off “frolicking with the freaks”. He declares he will never understand “those people”. To which Mary Ann, one of literature’s great innocents, softly replies: “Those people are my family.”

Some of the things that simply should happen do happen, such as Mary Ann and Anna locking tearful gazes across the party and then disappearing upstairs to get high. “Reality is overrated,” Anna declares, exhaling deeply. Or Mouse, keeping well on his antiretrovirals and newly in love, chiding Mary Ann for her earnestness because “who’s earnest any more”? Or Anna’s laconic speech about what life at 90 looks like: “You don’t wish for what’s to come. You revel in what’s already here.” Which, by the way, is also sage advice on how to approach the new Tales of the City.

The new generation of Mrs Madrigal’s children – “I call them my children … because they are,” she says, appley cheeks ablaze with love – are harder work (with the caveat that I might just be a moany old bi). This is where TotC veers into try-hard territory. For instance, the young droll lesbian making a documentary about “queer community and its disillusion as a result of strangling grip that capitalism has on San Francisco”. A line that lands with an I’ve-just-swallowed-the-little-dictionary-of-Judith-Butler-sized clunk, and extraordinarily is also intended as a come-on. To be fair the response, by the equally droll queer cool cat Shawna (Ellen Page), who is the adopted daughter of Mary Ann and her ex-husband Brian and is basically Shane from The L Word dispatched from LA to San Fran, is: “Do you always talk like that?” Spoiler: she does. And it works. They end up shagging in an alleyway.

Elsewhere, a previously lesbian and now queer couple are negotiating their way through one person’s transition with too much telling, not showing: “You’re excited Jake – you’re passing [as straight] and you’re excited!” And some twins have turned their bodies into live art for an Instagram account called Twintertainment1. There’s a sense that it’s trying to be all things to all people and generations. An understandable attempt to please that unfortunately results in a dilution of the original’s radicalism, mischief and warmth.

Nevertheless, even in this world where the once solo-existing chronicle of queer life now jostles for space alongside everything from Pose to Queer Eye, we need Tales of the City as much, if not more, than ever. So as Mouse says, arms outstretched on the (much bigger) lawn at 28 Barbary Lane, “welcome home, babycakes”.","How much has San Francisco changed since the 60s?

You piece together the language of an ancient civilisation as you go, but it’s the sturdy writing behind the characters that envelops you in this fiction.

What we said: “A winding but exhilarating galactic sojourn that differs from linear fiction in that it remembers and adapts to every choice and every path you follow in order to build a story acutely individual to the player.” Read the full review

Hypnospace Outlaw

A detective story set in a parallel-universe version of the 90s internet, at once nostalgic and wildly weird. You play an enforcer trying to track down illegal behaviour online, discovering a hilarious range of fictional internet subcultures as you work.

What we said: “Rather than lazily pastiching the ugliness and awkwardness of turn-of-the-century web pages, it really conjures that time when the internet was a place to go rather than a liminal omnipresence.” Read the full review

Slice through nightclubs, dodgy warehouses and hotels full of crime-lord goons as a drug-addicted samurai with the power to rewind time. Stylish in both form and substance, like a video-game reimagining of Drive, it has enough narrative intrigue to pull you through its story at breakneck speed.

Apex Legends

Slick, colourful and unrelenting, Apex Legends burst into the battle royale genre dominated by Fortnite and attracted 25 million players before a week had passed. Crammed with chunky weapons and wild characters, it is an absolute blast.

A supernatural-tinged samurai game centred on nerve-jangling, steel-meets-steel sword combat and themes of undeath, Sekiro is an extraordinary game that reveals more of its brilliance the longer you play – if you can rise to its very high difficulty level.

What we said: “If you have the time and dedication to throw at its mountainous challenges, you will find here an exquisite game whose subtle themes, gradually unfurling mysteries and beautiful samurai-period sights reward the determined and skilled player.” Read the full review

Sunless Skies

Renowned London studio Failbetter Games returns with an imaginative steam punk exploration adventure in which players pilot spacefaring locomotives across the cosmos, combatting pirates, madness and starvation.

Metro Exodus

It’s the sense of place that makes Metro Exodus stand out among shooters: its post-apocalyptic Russia is evocative and the pace of play is often slow and tense. You’re as likely to die because of a crack in your visor as at the hands of some mutant creature.

What we said: “Metro Exodus’s narrative explores where and how people look for hope when the world has ended … a world stunning in its devastation.” Read the full review

Walking Dead: The Final Series

The seminal interactive fiction series draws to its violent, shocking and engrossing conclusion with teenage hero Clementine seeking to save a younger child from the undead hordes. But can anyone really survive?

What we said: “By investing in its characters’ personalities and motivations and making each fight a real struggle for your life, The Walking Dead makes violence more meaningful.” Read the full review

Pikuniku

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mr blobby … Pikuniku. Photograph: Devolver Digital

A short, surreal comedy game about a red blob with long, wibbly legs, this bite-size platformer has the freewheeling, almost improvisational feel of late-night animation, or a weird kids’ TV show that you saw once on holiday in Sweden and can never quite be sure you didn’t dream up.

Baba Is You

The work of lone Finnish designer Arvi Teikari, Baba Is You is an innovative meta-puzzler where the rules of each level are displayed as blocks on the screen: move them around and you create your own rules and your own solutions. Mind-bendingly brilliant.

What we said: “Baba Is You is an invitation to play the role of a chaotic god, rewriting the rules of the universe … From this simple premise, Teikari spins dozens of ingenious challenges.” Read more

Mortal Kombat 11

The undisputed heavyweight of gore-splattered fighting games returns for an 11th bout of spine-ripping, eye-gouging punch ups. With a fresh selection of horrific finishing moves, it certainly hasn’t mellowed with age.

What we said: “Comfortably the best Mortal Kombat in a long time. Played competitively against another person, it’s great, and the single-player experience is the most accomplished of any recent fighter.” Read the full review

Outer Wilds

Combining the open-world space exploration genre with the movie Groundhog Day, this singular adventure asks players to attempt to solve an ancient mystery before the nearby sun goes supernova – but every time it does, you wake up at the start of a time loop, ready to make more progress. Offbeat and exceptional.

Void Bastards

Inspired by Douglas Adams and sci-fi anime, tiny development team Blue Manchu filled this strategy shooter with anarchic humour and cyberpunk style, creating an involving and gripping spaceship scavenging adventure.

What we said: “An idiosyncratic joy – a brash, clever, juvenile head-trip, messy at the edges but all the more likable for it.” Read the full review

Observation

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Unsettling … Observation Photograph: Epic Games

A space station adrift. A lone crew member in peril. A mission that’s not what it seemed to be. Observation’s setup is familiar from plenty of science fiction, but this clever, creepy, extraordinary game is transformed by its perspective: instead of playing as the endangered human, you are the AI that runs the space-station mainframe, looking on through fuzzy cameras as astronaut Emma Fisher tries to figure out what’s gone so terribly wrong.

What we said: “Observation has the formal innovation of something like Her Story; it’s an idea so good that you wonder why it hasn’t been done before. It’s unsettling and unconventional, and I was totally unable to turn away.” Read the full review

Total War: Three Kingdoms

The longrunning real-time strategy series brings its epic simulated warfare engine to ancient China as 12 warlords compete to dominate and unite the country. Intricate battles mix with subterfuge and political alliances to provide a nuanced challenge.

What we said: “A wonderfully torrid period epic that understands the greatest stories are written about people, not empires.” Read the full review

Boxboy! + Boxgirl!

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Square one … Boxboy! + Boxgirl! Photograph: Nintendo

One or two players must think their way through 270 levels, using the judicious placement of boxes to scale heights, block hazards and make progress. Japanese studio Hal Laboratory has been making wonderful, deceptively simple puzzle games for almost forty years, and its latest is a masterful continuation of that legacy.

The Gardens Between

The Gardens Between is about friends Arina and Frendt and their childhood memories, represented as island gardens. As they wander through each garden, you have to pause, rewind and fast-forward time – touchscreen swipe controls work beautifully for this – to ensure they reach their goals unharmed. A meditative oasis of calm, whose mix of puzzles and storytelling feels perfect to dip in and out of. Read the full review

Astrologaster

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The doctor will see you now ... Astrologaster. Photograph: Nyamyam

The earthy delights of Shakespearean London are the draw here. You play astrologer-cum-doctor (alternatively: complete charlatan) Simon Forman, a real historical figure with a very colourful career. Listening to a range of ailments from Forman’s patients, you consult the stars to provide (terrible) advice and medication. It’s a witty interactive novel, with a pop-up book style, that reveals its depths as you get to know the patients. The music, voice-acting and Elizabethan slang show impressive attention to detail, too. Read the full review

Social Dev Story

A sort-of sequel to cult smartphone hit Game Dev Story, this puts you in charge of a fledgling games studio with ambitions to be the next EA or Ubisoft. There are different interlocking ways to upgrade your company, staff and games, some of which you have to figure out for yourself. But once you grasp the details, this becomes a ferociously addictive business simulation, as you help your pixel-graphic staff take on the gaming world.

Rumble Stars Football

“Clash Royale but with footballs” would be the pitch for this game. It’s a multiplayer online battle-arena game based around passing, shooting and tackling, and it works brilliantly. Your players – who are all animals – form your deck of cards, ready to be laid down in matches to outfox your opponents. It’s one of the most accessible games of this type, as long as you like football, but there is also deep enjoyment to be had crafting the perfect team as you win matches and treasure chests to unlock and upgrade cards.

The Stillness of the Wind

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Quietly moving ... The Stillness of the Wind. Photograph: Fellow Traveller

Hit indie farming sim Stardew Valley turned out to be a game as much about people – and their emotional backstories – as it was about farming. The Stillness of the Wind has a similar emphasis on humans. Well, one human. You play Talma, an elderly farmer who slowly tends her goats, chickens and plants, trades with a salesman who visits every day, and reads letters from her family. It’s in these letters that Talma’s quietly moving story reveals itself. Read the full review

Rush Rally 3

In the early days of the app stores, racing was seen as a difficult genre for smartphones – especially the kind of slip’n’slidey road-racing games that touchscreen controls were thought to struggle with. Rush Rally 3 is the latest proof that this is poppycock. It looks good, there’s a well-structured career mode and skidding round tight bends feels exactly as you’d want it to.

Linn: Path of Orchards

You could quite easily mistake Linn: Path of Orchards’ app-store icon for a new Monument Valley game. It shares a visual sensibility, as well as rotation-based puzzles. It’s no copycat though. Here, you’re swiping to control your character, Aban, as the platforms and scenery shift around her. Finishing a level is rewarding, but bagging extra medals for collecting scattered shards offers the real challenge.

This War of Mine: Stories – Father’s Promise

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Difficult choices ... This War of Mine: Stories – Father’s Promise. Photograph: 11 Bit Studios

This War of Mine is an inspired twist on most war games, focusing on the experience of the civilians caught up in a conflict rather than the soldiers. In this story you play a father trying to protect his daughter. It starts bleakly, with grief and sickness, and continues in that vein, with mounting tension. The game involves difficult choices throughout. You’ll be thinking about it long after it’s over.

The Escapists 2: Pocket Breakout

The Escapists 2 puts you in the slammer, then challenges you to get out: but only after you’ve learned the routines of prison life, identifying the weak points (or people) to target. It’s a game that demands thoughtful planning rather than bull-in-a-china-shop action. It’s also very funny, with sharp and sometimes surreal banter.

Knights of the Card Table

If you like the idea of card-battler games like Hearthstone but are put off by their competitiveness, try Knights of the Card Table. It’s designed to be played alone as you crawl through a dungeon slaying monsters and grabbing treasure. The game does a great job of explaining the way its battles work and is a very accessible way into the genre for newcomers.

Sprout: Idle Garden

“Idle games” such as this have thrived on smartphones. These are apps you check in with every so often for a few minutes, before leaving them to carry on in your absence. Here you design a garden, collect flowers and earn money by attracting visitors, without ever feeling hassled to give it more time or money than you want to.

Dragalia Lost

Dungeons and dragons ... Dragalia Lost. Photograph: Nintendo

A brand new world from Nintendo for mobile, newly available in the UK after its original release in the US, Japan and other countries in 2018. It’s an action role-playing game in which you create a party of adventurers to explore dungeons – complete with a dragon whom you can call in for battles when needed. Actually, the real fun comes in geeking out over everything between the battles, carefully levelling up your heroes and balancing their abilities.

Nano Golf: Hole in One

Touch and swipe controls have turned out to be perfect for mini-golf on mobiles. This game refines the idea beautifully, chucking hole after hole at you with a variety of obstacles and tricksy angles to negotiate. Its one-fingered controls – touch the screen, then pull back and let go to putt – work well. Meanwhile, the varied and frequently silly balls (and bombs and bees) you can unlock add spice.

Monsters With Attitude

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cartoonish take on the city-stomping trope ... Monsters with Attitude. Photograph: Flaregames

From the Godzilla films to the classic arcade game Rampage, there has long been a thrill in seeing huge monsters smash up urban landscapes. Monsters With Attitude offers a fun, cartoonish spin on the city-stomping trope. You choose an alien beast and then send them out to bash buildings, growing in size as they go. It’s cathartic, silly enough to put a smile on your face, and online multiplayer lets you test your smashing skills against others.","It is not for the faint of heart or slow of trigger-finger.” Read the full reviewSekiro: Shadows Die TwiceFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steel yourself … Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

77,Best games of 2019 so far,Keith Stuart,"PC AND CONSOLE GAMES

Devil May Cry 5

A frenetic, over-the-top action game about sexy demon hunters, in which you are assaulted by hellish creatures, flashy visual effects and absurdly energetic rock music all at once. It is sensory overload, and an absolute blast.

What we said: “It’s bloody, spectacular and irresistible, all cheesy one-liners, guns, swords and explosions while guitars scream in the background, and it plays like a dream.” Read the full review

Resident Evil 2

A brilliant remake of the 1998 survival horror classic, providing series heroes Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield with terrifying new challenges as they explore the zombie-infested Racoon City police station.

What we said: “The rhythm, gradually building from many minutes of quiet exploration and puzzle-solving to gigantic, pulverising boss battles, is exact and beautiful, like some monstrous Wagner opera.” Read the full review

Heaven’s Vault

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Surreal galaxy … Heaven’s Vault. Photograph: Heaven's Vault

A reluctant archaeologist sets out across a surreal galaxy at the behest of her mentor, visiting strange places and stranger people in pursuit of a lost professor. You piece together the language of an ancient civilisation as you go, but it’s the sturdy writing behind the characters that envelops you in this fiction.

What we said: “A winding but exhilarating galactic sojourn that differs from linear fiction in that it remembers and adapts to every choice and every path you follow in order to build a story acutely individual to the player.” Read the full review

Hypnospace Outlaw

A detective story set in a parallel-universe version of the 90s internet, at once nostalgic and wildly weird. You play an enforcer trying to track down illegal behaviour online, discovering a hilarious range of fictional internet subcultures as you work.

What we said: “Rather than lazily pastiching the ugliness and awkwardness of turn-of-the-century web pages, it really conjures that time when the internet was a place to go rather than a liminal omnipresence.” Read the full review

Katana Zero

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Time lord … Katana Zero. Photograph: Devolver Digital

Slice through nightclubs, dodgy warehouses and hotels full of crime-lord goons as a drug-addicted samurai with the power to rewind time. Stylish in both form and substance, like a video-game reimagining of Drive, it has enough narrative intrigue to pull you through its story at breakneck speed.

Apex Legends

Slick, colourful and unrelenting, Apex Legends burst into the battle royale genre dominated by Fortnite and attracted 25 million players before a week had passed. Crammed with chunky weapons and wild characters, it is an absolute blast.

What we said: “This is the battle royale genre pitilessly trimmed to its wildest moments, where every encounter is a riot of explosive jump-cut hyper-violence. It is not for the faint of heart or slow of trigger-finger.” Read the full review

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steel yourself … Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

A supernatural-tinged samurai game centred on nerve-jangling, steel-meets-steel sword combat and themes of undeath, Sekiro is an extraordinary game that reveals more of its brilliance the longer you play – if you can rise to its very high difficulty level.

What we said: “If you have the time and dedication to throw at its mountainous challenges, you will find here an exquisite game whose subtle themes, gradually unfurling mysteries and beautiful samurai-period sights reward the determined and skilled player.” Read the full review

Sunless Skies

Renowned London studio Failbetter Games returns with an imaginative steam punk exploration adventure in which players pilot spacefaring locomotives across the cosmos, combatting pirates, madness and starvation.

What we said: “This is a game about gradually and fearfully charting a vast, hostile space, not brashly conquering it. And there are wonderful and terrible sights out in the farthest reaches.” Read the full review

Metro Exodus

It’s the sense of place that makes Metro Exodus stand out among shooters: its post-apocalyptic Russia is evocative and the pace of play is often slow and tense. You’re as likely to die because of a crack in your visor as at the hands of some mutant creature.

What we said: “Metro Exodus’s narrative explores where and how people look for hope when the world has ended … a world stunning in its devastation.” Read the full review

The Gardens Between is about friends Arina and Frendt and their childhood memories, represented as island gardens. As they wander through each garden, you have to pause, rewind and fast-forward time – touchscreen swipe controls work beautifully for this – to ensure they reach their goals unharmed. A meditative oasis of calm, whose mix of puzzles and storytelling feels perfect to dip in and out of. Read the full review

Astrologaster

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The doctor will see you now ... Astrologaster. Photograph: Nyamyam

The earthy delights of Shakespearean London are the draw here. You play astrologer-cum-doctor (alternatively: complete charlatan) Simon Forman, a real historical figure with a very colourful career. Listening to a range of ailments from Forman’s patients, you consult the stars to provide (terrible) advice and medication. It’s a witty interactive novel, with a pop-up book style, that reveals its depths as you get to know the patients. The music, voice-acting and Elizabethan slang show impressive attention to detail, too. Read the full review

Social Dev Story

A sort-of sequel to cult smartphone hit Game Dev Story, this puts you in charge of a fledgling games studio with ambitions to be the next EA or Ubisoft. There are different interlocking ways to upgrade your company, staff and games, some of which you have to figure out for yourself. But once you grasp the details, this becomes a ferociously addictive business simulation, as you help your pixel-graphic staff take on the gaming world.

Rumble Stars Football

“Clash Royale but with footballs” would be the pitch for this game. It’s a multiplayer online battle-arena game based around passing, shooting and tackling, and it works brilliantly. Your players – who are all animals – form your deck of cards, ready to be laid down in matches to outfox your opponents. It’s one of the most accessible games of this type, as long as you like football, but there is also deep enjoyment to be had crafting the perfect team as you win matches and treasure chests to unlock and upgrade cards.

The Stillness of the Wind

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Quietly moving ... The Stillness of the Wind. Photograph: Fellow Traveller

Hit indie farming sim Stardew Valley turned out to be a game as much about people – and their emotional backstories – as it was about farming. The Stillness of the Wind has a similar emphasis on humans. Well, one human. You play Talma, an elderly farmer who slowly tends her goats, chickens and plants, trades with a salesman who visits every day, and reads letters from her family. It’s in these letters that Talma’s quietly moving story reveals itself. Read the full review

Rush Rally 3

In the early days of the app stores, racing was seen as a difficult genre for smartphones – especially the kind of slip’n’slidey road-racing games that touchscreen controls were thought to struggle with. Rush Rally 3 is the latest proof that this is poppycock. It looks good, there’s a well-structured career mode and skidding round tight bends feels exactly as you’d want it to.

Linn: Path of Orchards

You could quite easily mistake Linn: Path of Orchards’ app-store icon for a new Monument Valley game. It shares a visual sensibility, as well as rotation-based puzzles. It’s no copycat though. Here, you’re swiping to control your character, Aban, as the platforms and scenery shift around her. Finishing a level is rewarding, but bagging extra medals for collecting scattered shards offers the real challenge.

This War of Mine: Stories – Father’s Promise

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Difficult choices ... This War of Mine: Stories – Father’s Promise. Photograph: 11 Bit Studios

This War of Mine is an inspired twist on most war games, focusing on the experience of the civilians caught up in a conflict rather than the soldiers. In this story you play a father trying to protect his daughter. It starts bleakly, with grief and sickness, and continues in that vein, with mounting tension. The game involves difficult choices throughout. You’ll be thinking about it long after it’s over.

The Escapists 2: Pocket Breakout

The Escapists 2 puts you in the slammer, then challenges you to get out: but only after you’ve learned the routines of prison life, identifying the weak points (or people) to target. It’s a game that demands thoughtful planning rather than bull-in-a-china-shop action. It’s also very funny, with sharp and sometimes surreal banter.

Knights of the Card Table

If you like the idea of card-battler games like Hearthstone but are put off by their competitiveness, try Knights of the Card Table. It’s designed to be played alone as you crawl through a dungeon slaying monsters and grabbing treasure. The game does a great job of explaining the way its battles work and is a very accessible way into the genre for newcomers.

Sprout: Idle Garden

“Idle games” such as this have thrived on smartphones. These are apps you check in with every so often for a few minutes, before leaving them to carry on in your absence. Here you design a garden, collect flowers and earn money by attracting visitors, without ever feeling hassled to give it more time or money than you want to.

Dragalia Lost

Dungeons and dragons ... Dragalia Lost. Photograph: Nintendo

A brand new world from Nintendo for mobile, newly available in the UK after its original release in the US, Japan and other countries in 2018. It’s an action role-playing game in which you create a party of adventurers to explore dungeons – complete with a dragon whom you can call in for battles when needed. Actually, the real fun comes in geeking out over everything between the battles, carefully levelling up your heroes and balancing their abilities.

Nano Golf: Hole in One

Touch and swipe controls have turned out to be perfect for mini-golf on mobiles. This game refines the idea beautifully, chucking hole after hole at you with a variety of obstacles and tricksy angles to negotiate. Its one-fingered controls – touch the screen, then pull back and let go to putt – work well. Meanwhile, the varied and frequently silly balls (and bombs and bees) you can unlock add spice.

Monsters With Attitude

From the Godzilla films to the classic arcade game Rampage, there has long been a thrill in seeing huge monsters smash up urban landscapes. Monsters With Attitude offers a fun, cartoonish spin on the city-stomping trope. You choose an alien beast and then send them out to bash buildings, growing in size as they go. It’s cathartic, silly enough to put a smile on your face, and online multiplayer lets you test your smashing skills against others.","It is not for the faint of heart or slow of trigger-finger.” Read the full reviewSekiro: Shadows Die TwiceFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steel yourself … Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

79,Anna Jones’ courgette recipes | The Modern Cook,Anna Jones,"Courgettes come into their own at this time of year, and especially sing in this crisp, parmigiana-style bake and Middle-Eastern spicy dip

Courgettes will now be keeping us company until the end of summer. Right now, the ones I buy come from Italy, but as soon as the summer is in full swing they will come in a glut from British farmers and allotments.

After a trip to Sicily, and a lot of aubergine parmigiana, I have been craving breadcrumb-topped bakes. This courgette and ricotta one has layers of texture that make me cook this again and again: crisp yet buttery courgettes, pillowy ricotta, and a topping of melty mozzarella and crunchy breadcrumbs. And something baked for 40 minutes is the perfect food for my life at the moment, as it cooks in the time it takes for bath, stories and bedtime with my son.

I’ve also been experimenting with vegetable dips to mix up our usual hummus, and this courgette one, with a hit of charred lemon, chilli and herbs layered over buttery roast courgettes, has been a hit. It’s a great way to use up any courgettes that are bruised or past their best – or, of course, for a glut from your garden when that times comes.

Crispy courgette and ricotta bake (above)

This is somewhere in parmigiana territory, but a little lighter and with no tomato. I have made this successfully for my vegan brother using a vegan, soft-style cheese in place of the ricotta and a vegan parmesan, and leaving out the mozzarella.

Prep 30 min

Cook 1 hr 10 min

Serves 6

200ml extra-virgin olive oil

4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped

1 onion, peeled and finely chopped

1 red chilli, finely chopped

2 unwaxed lemons

Salt and pepper

A few sprigs oregano, leaves picked

1 bunch basil, leaves picked

6 medium courgettes, cut on a mandoline into roughly 1cm slices

100g parmesan (I use a vegetarian one)

500g ricotta

150g breadcrumbs

200g ball buffalo mozzarella

Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. In a medium-sized frying pan, add half the olive oil, the garlic, chopped onions and chilli, and fry for five minutes over a medium heat, until soft and lightly golden. Grate in the zest of one lemon, season well, remove from the heat and tip into a large bowl.

Pour the remaining oil into a 20cm x 25cm roasting dish, squeeze in the juice of both lemons, then add the oregano and basil leaves (this will be the marinade).

In batches, char the courgettes for two minutes on each side in the frying pan, then put them in the baking tray, giving them a good toss in the marinade each time.

Once the onion mixture has cooled slightly, grate in the parmesan, stir through the ricotta and season well. Lift the courgettes out of the baking tray and tip the excess marinade into a small bowl.

Now put your bake together: cover the base of the baking dish with a layer of courgettes, top with a layer of the ricotta mixture followed by another layer of courgettes. Keep layering until you’ve used everything up, finishing with a layer of courgettes.

Toss the breadcrumbs with the remaining courgette marinade. Tear the mozzarella over the bake, top with the breadcrumbs and drizzle well with olive oil. Bake for 50 minutes, or until crisp and bubbling. Serve with a crisp, lemon-dressed salad.

Roast courgette and aleppo chilli dip

I like to keep this a little textured, so I chop it with a knife, but if you’re after a smoother texture, you could use a food processor. Turkish chilli, also called aleppo pepper or Syrian chilli, is a milder chilli with a red pepper note that I love to cook with. If you can’t get hold of it, use a smaller amount of dried red chilli to taste.

Prep 30 min

Cook 40 min

Serves 4-6

4 medium courgettes

150ml good-quality extra-virgin olive oil

1 whole head garlic

1 tsp aleppo chilli

Salt and black pepper

1 unwaxed lemon

½ bunch parsley, leaves picked

A few sprigs mint

Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Chop the courgettes into roughly 2cm pieces, put in a large roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil, add the garlic and chilli, and season well with salt and pepper.

Finely chop half the lemon and its rind, discarding any pips as you go, and add to the tray. Squeeze the juice of the other half over the courgettes and pop the squeezed half into the tray, too.

Roast for 40 minutes, tossing halfway through.

Remove the courgettes from the oven, squeeze the garlic out of its skin into the tray, and leave to cool a little.

Roughly chop the parsley on a large board, add the courgettes and chop together until you have a creamy dip – you can use a food processor if you prefer. Scoop on to a serving plate and scatter over the mint leaves. Serve at room temperature with flatbreads or crudites for dipping.","This courgette and ricotta one has layers of texture that make me cook this again and again: crisp yet buttery courgettes, pillowy ricotta, and a topping of melty mozzarella and crunchy breadcrumbs.

80,What do Rihanna and I have in common? We know the power of red lipstick,Hannah Jane Parkinson,"You can spot a baller woman by the fact that she wears no makeup, not a slick of it, except for one thing: a bold red lip. A lot of power women do this and, as with fashion designers who – maybe unexpectedly – seem to wear only black basics (roll-neck sweaters, trainers), it displays a simple self-assuredness. These are women who Get Things Done. A bit like how Mark Zuckerberg says he wears the same normcore outfit every single day because he is so busy. But also not. Because, euw, Mark Zuckerberg.

I am one of the women who often goes makeup-free aside from a red lipstick. But in my case it is more down to laziness, losing eyeliners and mascara, and being exceptionally time-poor. I can state with more certainty than Einstein’s theory of relativity that I am not in the power women clan. But the thing about a red lip is that, precisely because it is the look of those who have their shit together, it instantly elevates the rest of us. It also signals that you have made an effort, even though that effort has probably taken a single minute.

Everyone suits red lipstick, whereas other shades can wash out complexions, not suit, or terrify (think Fairuza Balk’s purple slash of a mouth in The Craft or when people attempt quirky orange). Crimson colouring also used to signal a plump, sexualised mouth (Marilyn Monroe, for instance). Red was the mark of the femme fatale. The sexy cherry tone of Sherilyn Fenn as Audrey Horne in Twin Peaks (and the seductive tying of an actual cherry knot with her tongue). Rihanna’s scarlet pout as she leaves the club, wine glass still in hand.

From high fives in the pub to nods between walkers, it’s great to bond with a stranger | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more

But now the red lip can be a little more utilitarian. Refreshingly, it is also something that draws the attention and complements facial structure. It is not designed, as with concealer or foundation, to hide. It is the lipstick equivalent of heading the boardroom meeting and walking into the party, shoulders back, chest out. It is also an affordable, accessible slice of glamour.

Sumerians are credited as the inventors of lipstick, followed by super-fans the Egyptians; both women and men would stain their lips with ochre or carmine. Elizabeth I, however, is probably the best known of the scarlet-mouthed. My favourite red lipstick tale, which unfortunately is disputed by historians, is that a law was passed in the 1770s banning it, aligning it with “witchcraft” and “trickery”. Disappointing that this probably isn’t true, but the fact it’s been believed for so long is proof of the red lip’s mighty power.","A lot of power women do this and, as with fashion designers who – maybe unexpectedly – seem to wear only black basics (roll-neck sweaters, trainers), it displays a simple self-assuredness.

81,Saint Laurent hits Malibu beach for menswear fashion show,Simon Chilvers,"A leopard-print invitation, a boardwalk runway built of wooden slats on the beach at Paradise Cove in Malibu, with the waves crashing against it and an army of models with a Mick Jagger swagger all set the scene for the spring/summer 2020 men’s Saint Laurent collection.

Filmy shirts unbuttoned to the navel fluttered in the breeze, a trenchcoat with a certain swish was paired with cutoff denim shorts, while house trademark suiting came in white; a contrast that looked particularly on pointe against the moody, Whistler-like evening sky.

Signature embellished jackets (half of the audience were wearing these) featured throughout, while a very Yves Saint Laurent belted safari jacket in suede underscored a 1970s theme. And when trousers weren’t typically spray-on skinny, they were more fluid, harem-like styles which nodded to the house founder’s own love of Marrakech.

Backstage, the house’s creative director, Anthony Vaccarello, revealed the source of this collection: “I met Mick Jagger, as I am dressing him for his new tour, and he talked a lot about his relationship with Yves Saint Laurent. He was showing me pictures of him in Marrakech, and I was inspired by that period of the 1970s.” Specifically, Vaccarello was looking at the band’s 1975 tour to build what the show notes underlined: “The ultimate timeless bohemian attitude.”

“When you think about Mick, you don’t think of him dressing like a girl. He is so sure of himself. He can wear anything,” the designer said explaining Jagger’s appeal. A one-shouldered purple top that was slashed across the model’s torso to reveal a nipple sparkled in the evening Malibu light, and looked like the kind of things Annie Leibovitz captured Jagger wearing on tour. Various images of Jagger and the Stones were recently included in a retrospective of Leibovitz’s work mounted at Hauser & Wirth in LA.

Vaccarello has form when it comes to making a location statement, having created Instagram catnip fashion moments at the Eiffel Tower in Paris and for his last men’s show in New York for spring/summer 2018. The Malibu location ticked this box in spades. Originally, he said that he had thought to show the collection in Marrakech, but had decided that in fact LA felt like a new version of that city, with a similar sense of relaxed spirit in the way that people approached clothes.

Keanu Reeves, who appears in the Saint Laurent campaign, was sitting in the audience. The actor’s cult 1991 film, Point Break, in a neat connection, featured scenes shot in Malibu. Asked about why he had chosen Reeves, Vaccarello said that he always picks people he idolised as a teenager, such as Charlotte Gainsbourg or Vincent Gallo. “Keanu is like a dream,” he said. “I thought I was the only one who was attracted to him, but the reaction [to the campaign] has been amazing. Keanu represents the 90s, and I’m always a bit close to that.”

This was not the first time the brand has shown in LA. Its Former creative director Hedi Slimane showed the autumn/winter 2016 men’s collection at the Palladium on Sunset Boulevard, complete with live performances by Beck and Joan Jett. Slimane even moved the design studio from Paris to LA.

Vaccarello, who has worked with the likes of Karl Lagerfeld and Donatella Versace, didn’t show a stand-alone men’s runway collection until he had been at the house for two years. His approach has been to remain relatively faithful to the Slimane blueprint, which was always set out to capture the spirit of Saint Laurent himself, who notably designed little menswear during his reign. Despite this, many of his most celebrated women’s designs revolved around traditional menswear shapes, particularly the infamous Le Smoking suit inspired by the tuxedo.

Vaccarello’s approach is proving to appeal to a particular kind of man. Matchesfashion.com reports strong sales on Saint Laurent menswear. According to Damien Paul, head of menswear at the retailer, a leopard-print pussy-bow shirt (selling for about £1,000) sold out quickly this season. “We find any item that evokes the spirit of Saint Laurent sells very well. Intrinsic DNA pieces are popular regardless of retail price.”

Daniel Todd, a buyer at Mr Porter concurs: “Saint Laurent continues to be one of the top selling brands season after season. The brand gives customers a signature look, with iconic pieces throughout. Saint Laurent resonates on a global level for us, but we certainly have seen the US and Europe as core markers for our customer base.”","Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lennon Gallagher models rock-star ready jackets on the Saint Laurent catwalk.

‘I want to die on my native soil’: exiled Chagos Islanders dream of return

The Chagos Islanders have had few victories in their long battle to return from British-enforced exile to their archipelago homeland in the Indian Ocean.

But small steps keep their campaign alive and it is hoped a documentary that will premiere on Saturday will exert pressure on the UK government to change its stance.

Britain’s ongoing occupation of the islands was declared illegal in February in an “advisory opinion” by the international court of justice at The Hague. Last month, the UN general assembly showed overwhelming support for a motion setting a six-month deadline for a withdrawal from the Chagos Islands so the archipelago could be reunified with Mauritius.

The film aims to bring a shameful episode in Britain's post-colonial history out of the shadows Olivier Magis, film-maker

Yet the islanders remain stuck in exile. After being evicted in the 60s and 70s, some Chagossians were given British passports in 2002; today, an estimated 3,000 second- and third-generation islanders live in Britain.

The film, Another Paradise, by Belgian director Olivier Magis, documents a community in Crawley, West Sussex, home to Britain’s largest Chagossian population.

It will also be screened by public service broadcasters in Belgium, France and Finland.

“The film serves to bring a shameful episode in Britain’s post-colonial history out of the shadows,” said Magis. “When you listen to the arguments of the British government in the past few years, everything is justified. Politicians talk about relocation, not deportation, without mentioning what really happened and the way it happened.”

Sabrina Jean, 46, chair of the Chagos Refugee Group’s UK branch, said she hoped the UN decision and the documentary, which will be shown at the Sheffield film festival on 8 and 10 June, would help: “We know the UN decision is not binding. I don’t know yet what will happen but Chagossians will not sit down. We will fight for our rights.”

Jean’s father, 68-year-old Serge Aristide, was among the 1,500-plus people forced to leave the British overseas territory when it was leased to the US to build a military base in Diego Garcia. They were taken in boats to Mauritius and the Seychelles without relocation assistance, and most lived in poverty. Jean moved from Mauritius to the UK in 2006.

Timeline Chagos Islands Show Hide

France establishes colony Diego Garcia is made home to a French colony using slave labour on plantations Britain takes control Mauritius and the Chagos Islands are ceded to Britain at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in the Treaty of Paris Becomes part of British Indian Ocean Territory Before independence is granted to Mauritius, the UK separates the Chagos archipelago from Mauritius, creating British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Military deal with US Britain allows the US to use the largest island, Diego Garcia, as a military base in exchange for a discount on the purchase of Polaris missiles. Expulsions begin Forced expulsion of around 1,500 Chagossians begin as access to food supplies is restricted. Most are moved to Mauritius or the Seychelles. Compensation is offered Chagossian refugees in Mauritius were paid compensation, and more offers followed contingent on them signing agreements not to return to their homes. Resettlement to the UK British passports are granted to some Chagossians. Many move from Mauritius to Crawley. A UK government feasibility study into resettlement concludes it would be expensive and difficult. Wikileaks revelations A Marine Protected Area is established around the Chagos Islands. Documents published by Wikileaks show a UK diplomat saying that “establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago’s former residents”. Government actions ruled illegal International Court of Justice rules that the agreement to separate the Chagos Islands from Mauritius in 1965 prior to decolonisation was unlawful. UN defeat for the UK The United Nations general assembly overwhelmingly backs a motion condemning Britain’s occupation of the islands. The vote, which left the UK diplomatically isolated, set a six-month deadline for the UK to withdraw from the archipelago and for it to be reunified with neighbouring Mauritius.

“Sabrina is full of hope, full of optimism and I hope that anyone who struggles will be inspired by her,” said Magis. “She left school at 16, she is an NHS cleaner, but she fights against the US and the UK. She uses all the small tools she can find everyday, to help her community, to organise cultural events, to remember the creole culture. She has nothing but she gives everything. In French, we call it the strategy of the little steps.

“My hope is that this will strike a chord with UK and US audiences. The Chagossians are a very small community. They don’t have any money and the UK government are playing a waiting strategy … waiting until the third or the fourth generation are rooted in UK soil and they will forget.”

At last, the Chagossians have a real chance of going back home | Philippe Sands Read more

Much of the documentary was filmed in 2016, a crucial year, when the US lease for the Diego Garcia military base was scheduled to end. But, in a crushing defeat for the islanders, Alan Duncan, the foreign secretary at the time, confirmed a ban on resettlement to the islands. What had happened was “deplorable”, Duncan said, but the government had decided against resettlement, on the grounds of “feasibility, defence and security interests, and the cost to the British taxpayer”.

The relocation of 1,500 people was estimated to cost £256m.

Serge Aristide, who was 17 when he was forced to leave Peros Banhos, one of the Chagos islands, said his soul would not rest until he went home. “I don’t want to be buried in the land of the colonisers,” he said. “I want to die on my native soil, where I’ll be surrounded by native fish, sharks, turtles, rays, silk snapper, ruby snapper … here my soul can rest.”","People evicted from former British colony hope new documentary Another Paradise will reinforce UN calls for withdrawal‘I want to die on my native soil’: exiled Chagos Islanders dream of returnThe Chagos Islanders have had few victories in their long battle to return from British-enforced exile to their archipelago homeland in the Indian Ocean.

86,'Why replace dolphins with oil drilling?': the battle for Greece's marine life,Helena Smith,"From sperm whales to dolphins, marine mammals in the eastern Mediterranean face a lethal threat from oil and gas exploration

Before the giants of oil and gas joined the litany of threats facing Greek sperm whales, the plight of the world’s largest-toothed animal was little known.

Like the Hellenic trench, which was discovered only two decades ago and is the habitat most associated with the species, the mammals were once the preserve of dedicated oceanographers. Now international eco-warriors, bent on stopping oil companies drilling for underwater reserves, are determined to put both the region and its unique species on the map.

At stake is an unusually endangered zone. One of the world’s most significant marine mammal areas, it is home not only to the sperm whale, Greece’s chief predator, but fin whales, Cuvier’s beaked whales, fast-vanishing common dolphins, Mediterranean monk seals and loggerhead sea turtles. All face mortal danger if, as planned, exploration for hydrocarbons is conducted off the country’s western coast.

With worries mounting, WWF Greece and Greenpeace recently went to Athens’ highest administrative court, the council of state, in the hope of getting two oil company concessions annulled in waters off western and south-western Crete. The organisations cited inadequate environmental monitoring, both post- and pre-exploration.

The move follows publication of an unprecedented declaration by 100 of the world’s leading scientists, conservation and ecological groups. The prospective drilling was described in a two-page statement as the death knell for iconic sea mammals already facing manmade threats ranging from ship strikes and plastic pollutants to radar noise from military naval exercises.

“Despite its global import, cetaceans in the Hellenic trench are already facing a series of direct and severe threats,” the signatories opined, calling on leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras to cancel the offshore activity.

“Oil and gas exploration and exploitation as an additional great threat … would become an important blow to their chances of survival.”

Greece, they said, should instead follow “the bold political and investment decisions” of other EU member states by embracing renewable energy rather than hydrocarbons, one of the biggest drivers of climate change.

The Hellenic trench runs from the north of Corfu in the Ionian Sea to the south of Crete – an area equivalent to 56,000 sq km, nearly twice the size of Belgium.

Since 2012, offshore oil and gas concessions amounting to 72% of the debt-stricken country’s territorial waters have been granted to six companies, four multinational and two Greek. Four onshore concessions have also been handed over. All have been initialled, signed or ratified by successive cash-strapped governments in Athens, with each concession set at 25 years from the moment of exploitation.

But in the race to attract foreign investment, campaigners say the nation long at the centre of the eurozone debt crisis has also cut corners. Blocks handed to the oil industry overlap with critical habitats of marine biodiversity that, according to WWF Greece, are of far-reaching ecological significance.

In the bid to make hydrocarbon extraction one of the main engines of economic recovery, the group claims that established legal protections have been repeatedly rolled back.

“Even in the stages of seismic testing, companies have been exempted from the obligation to conduct environmental impact assessments,” said Dimitris Ibrahim, WWF Greece’s chief Athens-based campaigner. “Instead, they have been allowed to conduct seismic testing in protected areas onland that are designated national parks and Natura 2000 sites.”

At sea, it is feared testing will wreak untold damage on the hearing and orientation of whales, dolphins, turtles and monk seals –mammals especially vulnerable to acoustic signals generated by seismic airguns. Although the oil and gas industry has frequently asserted that seismic research has no detrimental effect, evidence proves otherwise, environmentalists say.

This year, about 50 sea turtles washed up on Israel’s coast, with many either dead or bleeding in what was subsequently attributed by the country’s sea turtle rescue centre to seismic tests in coastal waters rich in oil and gas.

“For so many of our marine mammal population it will literally be the coup de grace if Greece continues with these plans,” said Dr Alexandros Frantzis, an oceanographer who has spent 25 years studying cetaceans in the region.

“For deep-diving sperm whales and Cuvier’s beaked whales, the Hellenic trench is vital for survival,” added Frantzis, who signed the request for Crete and other concessions to be annulled. “For the latter, this is the largest hotspot in the entire Mediterranean Sea, and for sperm whales there is no other breeding and nursing area in the entire Mediterranean.”

As head of Greece’s Pelagos Cetacean Research Institute, Frantzis has done more to reveal the country’s extraordinary underwater diversity than perhaps anyone else alive. Over the years, he has observed ever more mammals meeting untimely deaths.

“Ship-strikes, alone, along the Hellenic tench will likely drive the sperm whale population to extinction if no measures are taken,” he says of a species now believed to number fewer than 300 in Greek waters.

“Pollution by microplastic is already provoking deaths of cetaceans found stranded with stomachs full of plastic.”

Hydrocarbon development will be “the last straw”, he contends.

Exploration could start as early as the end of the year. Spearheading the campaign to stop the drilling plans, WWF, which will soon be raising awareness on Ionian islands including Corfu, Kefalonia, Zakynthos and Ithaka, has been increasingly sounding the alarm. The organisation recently warned of the potentially devastating effect on jobs and money of “an unmanageable, catastrophic oil spill” prompted by the ultra-deep drilling envisaged in coastal areas uniquely dependent on tourism along the Hellenic trench.

At least two of the companies (French multinational Total and US firm ExxonMobil) have been publicly linked with devastating spillages elsewhere.

At a time when other parts of Europe are seeking to promote sustainable economies by progressively banning oil and gas investments, environmental groups say it beggars belief that Greece is keen to develop an industry so clearly on the wane. With its wealth of sun and wind reserves, the country could be leading the charge to develop clean energy.

“At the very moment when the planet is making an unprecedented effort to tackle climate change, here in Greece we choose to lock in our future in search of a fuel whose time has passed,” said Ibrahim. “It’s hugely ironic given the country’s tremendous potential, and when all available data indicates that renewable energy generates more jobs per dollar invested compared with oil drilling.”

Describing the quest to tap hydrocarbons as Greece’s biggest emerging threat – to the environment, economy and local communities – Ibrahim, like Frantzis, insists the fight is now on. And, they add, they will give it their all as they take on the world’s biggest oil companies. Protests in affected areas are also being stepped up.

“We have to give it our all, because if we lose this there will be no way back,” said Frantzis. “For oil companies, the treasure may lie below the sea bottom and still even that is uncertain. For Greeks, our marine environment is our natural heritage, a source of income for millions who depend on tourism. Why would we want to replace dolphins that have existed since antiquity with oil platforms and tankers?”","From sperm whales to dolphins, marine mammals in the eastern Mediterranean face a lethal threat from oil and gas explorationBefore the giants of oil and gas joined the litany of threats facing Greek sperm whales, the plight of the world’s largest-toothed animal was little known.

87,'Haunted for the rest of my life': veterans recall D-day landings,Caroline Davies,"It was a great day. It was a terrible day. So, as the dwindling few who bore witness to the monumental feat of endeavour and ingenuity of D-day returned to Normandy’s beaches, emotions were conflicted. Street parties, flypasts, swing bands and sing-a-longs contrasted with solemn ceremonies where the celebratory was vastly outweighed by reminders of the scale of human sacrifice.

On the seafront at Arromanches, overlooking Gold beach where 75 years ago a blue-grey armada had filled the horizon as far as the eye could see, a lone piper marked H-hour. It was the moment at 7.26am when the first British soldier landed on Gold beach exactly 75 years ago.

Quick guide What happened on D-day? Show Hide What was D-day? D-day was an invasion of France by allied forces. It was codenamed Operation Neptune, and it aimed to push Nazi Germany out of occupied France. Five beaches in Normandy, codenamed Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, were the main targets for landing a large number of troops by sea. At 10pm on 5 June 1944, troops began departing from British shores to head across the Channel. Five assault groups set sail under darkness in an armada of about 7,000 vessels. Just after midnight on 6 June, aerial bombardment of enemy positions on the Normandy coast began. Special operations troops were also parachuted into France. US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches at about 6:30am. About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword. Soldiers had to get off their boats, wade through the water, and seize control of the beach, all the while under heavy and sustained fire from German defensive positions. How was the plan kept secret? Despite involving a large number of troops, keeping D-day secret was vital to the success of the operation. A disinformation campaign had led the Germans to believe that Operation Fortitude was the main plan for the allies to invade the continent, via a two-pronged attack involving Norway and Calais. Even once the D-day landings had begun, German commanders were convinced they were just a diversionary tactic before the real invasion. Why is it called D-day? The D in D-day actually has no particular significance to Operation Neptune. It was common practice in the military to make plans that used the term, where the D stands for the day when operations commenced. Military planners also set H-hour, the time at which a plan was to begin. What happened next? By the end of the day, the allies had disembarked more than 135,000 men and 10,000 vehicles on to the beaches, and established bridgeheads of varying depths along the Normandy coastline. This came at the cost of 4,400 allied troops being killed, with thousands more injured or missing. There were also heavy casualties among German troops and French civilians. By 19 August, the allied forces had pushed down far enough to begin the battle to liberate Paris. German troops surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944, two and a half months after D-day. Martin Belam

The lone piper Maj Macey-Lille, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (the Scottish Gunners), stood atop the decaying vestige of the Mulberry harbour still embedded in the sand, to play Highland Laddie as crowds gathered.

For veterans who had returned to Normandy, seeing the beaches and the quiet villages, now household names, that they fought their way through in France, is still overwhelming. Memories were of running for the dunes, bullets bouncing, shells screaming, beaches vibrating as the allied naval guns pounded German targets to provide cover for those going in.

The cemeteries are particularly emotional. “You think to yourself, all them lying there, why aren’t I one of them? Because I were with them,” says Ray Mellors, 94, from Nottingham, who as an 18-year-old with the South Staffordshire Regiment, had waded through the sea, “in the dark and wet”, towards Sword beach shortly after D-day.

“It’s haunted me for the rest of my life. I sit here now, and I think to myself ‘I shouldn’t be here, really. I should be under the ground where the others are’.”

When his battalion was decimated, he was part of the reserves, waiting to be placed with others to replace men they had lost. He first joined the Welch Regiment, then the Black Watch, moving through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and finally, Germany. “And, I was always thinking to myself ‘my time is going to come, I know it is’. But it didn’t.”

“There was a lot going on,” says John Eden, 94, from Silverdale, Morecambe Bay, who as a 19-year-old private in the 12th (Airborne) Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment landed the day after D-day. “This brings back feelings you don’t really want to feel.”

He says: “Don’t forget, I was a terrified little lad.”

He could not explain why he had been drawn back. “What can you say? I had four years in the army, and this was part of it, an experience that you can’t comprehend, can you? You can’t imagine how you did it”. At Ranville war cemetery, he planned to visit “two particular graves” for fallen comrades.

Away from the cemeteries, there is a carnival atmosphere on Normandy’s streets during the 75th commemorations. Many, still find it unbelievable that local people will come up, shake their hand, and say thank you.

Revisiting the small villages, Douglas Russell, 97, who lives in Morecambe, was surprised at the warm welcome. “All the people that have turned up, people shaking my hand. It’s nice. But I’m not a hero, just an ordinary chap.”

This is the first time he has returned since landing on Sword beach, with the 43rd Wessex infantry division two days after D-day. “Seeing all the crowds has amazed me. I am glad I came. At my time of life it’s the only chance I’ll get, isn’t it?” He went all the way to Berlin. His job was to treat the water from rivers and streams to ensure that his men had safe drinking water.

James Anderson, 97, a signalman, was seconded to the Norwegian destroyer Glaisdale, which on D-day escorted the Canadians to Juno beach, firing on the German defences to soften them before the troops ran for the beach, then closing in to provide cover. “We were hitting machine-gun posts. “And, as the firing destroyed a house, the house would fall on the machine gunner and give them more protection, so we had to go really close in and get rid of them,” he says.

He watched those on the landing crafts struggle through the waves under fire to reach the shore. “All the landing craft were flat bottomed, and I felt very sorry for the men because most of them were seasick. Then they had to go onshore against the enemy. Not very good.”

He spent the rest of June 1944 protecting the beach, until his ship hit a mine, and he was injured. They were towed back to the UK where he was hospitalised for two weeks.

“I know I am the only one left from my ship, now,” he says.

This was the second time he had returned to Normandy. He had never wanted to come back before. “It’s unfortunately part of your life, and when the war finished, all I wanted to do was get back to my wife, and rear a family, and forget it,” says Anderson, from Manchester, who went on to work for an advertising agency.

Visiting the cemeteries would be hard, he says. “I know I am not going to like it when we get to Omaha and see the American cemetery. Those numbers of graves are just too much.”","About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword.

88,A 'cloud of ladybugs' had the internet buzzing. But was it real?,Maanvi Singh In San Francisco,"‘It’s definitely not birds, and it’s not bats. But we’re still not sure if it’s ladybugs,’ National Weather Service meteorologist says

A 'cloud of ladybugs' had the internet buzzing. But was it real?

The internet is abuzz with talk of ladybugs.

On Tuesday, the San Diego office of the National Weather Service tweeted that it had picked up an odd radar echo that evening.

It looked like a bit of rain, the meteorologist Alex Tardy, who works at the San Diego office, told the Guardian. “But then we realized – it’s not raining,” Tardy said. The team spoke with volunteer weather spotters in the area, and one of them noticed “a lot of ladybugs around”.

Based on that information, the office sent out a memorable tweet.

NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) The large echo showing up on SoCal radar this evening is not precipitation, but actually a cloud of lady bugs termed a ""bloom"" #CAwx pic.twitter.com/1C0rt0in6z

The post was retweeted more than a thousand times, and both local and national news outlets caught on.

And since then, Tardy says, he and other meteorologists in the office have been working to confirm the theory – with little luck.

“It’s definitely not birds, and it’s not bats. But we’re still not sure if it’s ladybugs,” Tardy said. The radar was picking up on “lots of tiny things, about the size of large raindrops”, he noted. Those could have been bugs, or possibly chaff – bits of aluminum or other materials that the military disperses in the air in order to confuse and overwhelm aircraft-detecting radars.

The Guardian has contacted the nearby Edwards air force base and Twentynine Palms Marine Corps air ground combat center, but neither immediately responded to requests for comment.

“Because this was at night, the visibility would have been low,” Tardy noted. “And whatever we caught on the radar was pretty high up – more than 5,000ft in the air,” impossible to capture with cameras or cellphones from the ground.

“It’s too bad there wasn’t anyone in a private plane up in the air at that time,” said Lynn Kimsey, an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. “We could’ve figured it out based on which dead insects were splatted across the wings,” added Kimsey, who has worked with Nasa and Boeing in the past to do just that.

“It wouldn’t surprise me that it was ladybugs, although it seems a bit late in the season,” she said. The bright red insects are known to hibernate in clusters along California’s foothills and migrate west in the springtime.

Mobilized by warm weather, a huge group of bugs might have taken flight together or gotten swept up with the wind, she said.

But other experts noted that it was highly unusual for thousands or millions of ladybugs in California to migrate all at once. “They tend to move gradually rather than in huge clusters,” said Steve Heydon, a curator of the Bohart Museum of Entomology in Davis. “It’s not like they’re caribou or something.”

Moreover, a cool evening doesn’t present the optimal conditions for ladybugs to take flight, he noted. Ladybugs tend to be active at temperatures of about 60F or higher.

Weather balloons that night estimated temperatures lower than that, according to Tardy.

It’s “not impossible that a swarm could be caught in a wind stream,” said the Cornell University entomologist John Losey in an email. “A swarm this large has never been observed on radar before as far as I am aware,” though huge swarms have washed up along coasts in Egypt, the UK and the United States, he said.

Generally, swarms in the air are hard to see with the naked eye and have rarely been observed. And so, Losey said, “we may never know exactly what caused these radar patterns”.

89,"'No more stolen sisters': 12,000-mile ride to highlight missing indigenous women",Carey Dunne,"Up to 4,000 Indigenous women are killed or missing in Canada, while in the US they face murder rates up to 10 times higher than the national average

Joan Jack tied nine red silk ribbons to the back of her Harley Davidson before setting off from Winnipeg, heading east down Canada’s Highway 1.

Jack, a Winnipeg-based lawyer, activist, and Ojibwe tribal member, is one of more than 100 motorcyclists joining the Ride for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW), which begins on Saturday, and comprises a 12,000-mile relay ride across the US and Canada to raise awareness of the gender violence epidemic in Indian country.

Decades of missing Indigenous women a 'Canadian genocide' – leaked report Read more

Written on the ribbons were the names of indigenous women who had been murdered or gone missing in recent years; among them were two of Jack’s cousins.

The widespread killings and disappearances of indigenous women and girls in Canada constitute a “race-based genocide” that has claimed as many as 4,000 victims in the past 30 years, according to a landmark report released this week. The crisis is not confined to Canada: Indigenous women and girls in the US face estimated murder rates up to 10 times higher than the national average, and there is no comprehensive, federal database tracking cases related to the epidemic.

Carrying prayer bundles of sacred plants and flying red flags that read “No More Stolen Sisters,” riders will depart from cities all over North America, then weave in and out of the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders, tracing a route shaped like a traditional medicine wheel.

“This ride is about showing we’re so much more than our victimization,” said Jack, who got a head start on the journey in late May, since she is one of two women spending a month riding the entire medicine wheel route. “It’s about occupying our space powerfully – not as victims, but as landowners.”

Native American and First Nations women and girls are disproportionately targeted by sex traffickers, and more than half report experiencing domestic or sexual abuse at some point during their lives. Until recently, governments and law enforcement have largely ignored this crisis, however. In the US, 5,712 cases of MMIW were reported in 2016, but only 116 of these cases were logged in DoJ databases, according to a 2018 report by the Urban Indian Health Institute.

“The Ride for MMIW is part memorial, part prayer, and part awareness-spreading effort,” said Shelly Denny, who organized the journey. A 42-year-old New Mexico-based acupuncturist and member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, Denny calls herself a “Healer on a Harley”; she grew up in a motorcycle-loving family and now runs an online community of Native women motorcyclists. She was moved to action after hearing this community trade stories of murdered loved ones – stories generally ignored by the media.

“Pretty much every Native person knows a girl or woman who’s gone murdered or missing,” Denny said. “I wanted to find a way to leverage what I do to draw attention to this crisis. I’m not an expert on MMIW, but I am an expert on planning long motorcycle trips.”

As they travel, riders plan to leave sex trafficking helpline pamphlets in gas station bathrooms, meet with activist organizations and indigenous tribe leaders, and promote the online hashtag #RidingForMMIW. Denny hopes to organize education sessions with indigenous families living near pipeline developments, which house many “man camps”, where Native women risk being abducted into the sex trade. “Many families don’t know how that process works,” she said.

“As a parent, every time one of my kids goes out, I worry, are they gonna come back?” Jack said. “All parents worry, but I don’t think white people have to worry as bad.”

Among the women whose names grace the ribbons on Jack’s Harley are Claudette Osborne, a mother of four who disappeared at age 21 in 2008; Sharon Abraham, who was presumed dead in 2004 after her fingernail was found on the Vancouver pig farm of serial killer Robert Pickton; and Tanya Nepinak, who disappeared in 2011 after leaving her Winnipeg home to walk to a pizza restaurant. All of these cases remain unsolved.

On 14 June, riders will convene in Topeka, Kansas, at the Women’s Freedom Rally, where thousands plan to gather in hopes of setting the world record for most women riding motorcycles in one place.

Near the rally, a tribal elder will lead a prayer and pipe ceremony dedicated to MMIW. Denny stresses that the spiritual significance of the ride is as important as its practical goals. “What we’re doing is not just of the material, ordinary world,” she said.

When the ride is complete, Denny plans to start a non-profit organization advocating for indigenous rights. “I’m hoping to give families the feeling that their loved one is not forgotten,” she said.

90,Digital transformation: how traditional companies can keep pace with change,Nicole Kobie,"Businesses can be transformed by technology, but leadership is essential. Photograph: Bill Hinton/Getty Images

Every brand, organisation and company needs to transform to keep up with the pace of technological change, to keep costs low and customer service high and fight off rivals new and old – or risk being left behind.

Just ask Blockbuster, Kodak and countless other firms that failed to react quickly enough to the digital revolution, says Mark Basham, CEO of AXELOS, best practice solutions provider. “Business has transformed enormously on the back of technology, and service providers that haven’t acknowledged those changes, or haven’t changed fast enough, have paid the price,” he explains.

That said, businesses that sell to other businesses have a bit more breathing room than consumer-facing companies, which move at a much faster pace, says Marcus Wuerker, chief information officer for UK and Ireland at DHL Supply Chain. “You get impacted by trends potentially later.”

Taking your time when you are an established brand isn’t necessarily a bad idea, as it gives you a chance to see which trends make sense and which don’t for your evolving business models. “We have a dedicated team that monitors business and technology trends and tries to map them on a timescale and whether or not they’re relevant to us,” Wuerker says. “That has helped focus our efforts on trends that are really relevant for us.” In this sector, developments include sensors that track temperature in pallets and map congestion, as well as augmented-reality glasses to help staff pick products more accurately in warehouses.

Even traditional brands that could get left behind on digital development have time to catch up, given the more sedate pace of change. They can then do it in an organised, carefully considered way. Rachel Murphy, who is now chief executive officer of digital transformation company Difrent Group, led NHS Digital through a digital transformation that covered everything patients interact with, from rolling out wifi to every hospital and surgery in the UK to creating an official health app library. “There was a huge appetite to move to digital ways of working,” she says.

But with so much work to do, where to start? “I think it’s important to think about why you’re trying to transform a business, and what it is you’re trying to achieve,” Basham says. “Are you trying to compete with digital disruptors – or are you trying to be that disruptor?” Those goals or outcomes could be improving customer experience, lowering costs, boosting revenue or expanding to new markets. “Having the foundations, the fundamentals in place at the beginning is critical if you want to successfully drive any kind of transformation programme.”

Standards are key to that, explains David Whetton, vice-president for quality and operational systems at GKN Driveline, which is revamping its manufacturing factories to introduce better traceability, become paperless, and make use of automation. “We spent probably 12 or 18 months getting ourselves ready by developing standards for equipment, connectivity, digital visual displays, and our factories,” he says. With those in place, it’s easier to roll out changes across factories dotted around the world.

Finding the right staff is vital – but often a challenge, says Murphy. Her work transforming the patient-facing aspects of NHS Digital saw external experts brought in to augment in-house skills. “I don’t think anybody really has the skills internally for every aspect of digital transformation,” she says.

But traditional companies shouldn’t forget that in-house staff have plenty to offer. DHL Supply Chain encouraged employees to specialise in digital and tech topics that interested them, whether those innovations directly applied to their roles or not, taking advantage of their passion to drive projects. GKN’s Whetton agrees. “You’ve got to really connect the intelligence of people to the gadgets for use on the shop floor … in a way that they feel ownership and recognise the benefits they can bring, rather than them being pushed down as a corporate strategy, where it’s something being done to them.”

Is AI the new electricity? Read more

Plus, this approach helps counter feelings that automation is being used to replace human workers, he adds. “The short-term view is taking out a few jobs,” Whetton explains, saying automated guided vehicles to carry parts and equipment are actually safer for staff and less stressful than human-driven forklifts. “There are intangible benefits we never anticipated.”

That said, Murphy and Basham agree that bringing a traditional brand into the digital age needs leadership from the top. If the executive team isn’t convinced, such projects will struggle. “When you’re driving change like this, you’ve got to have buy-in and top cover,” Murphy says, adding that such support enabled her to run a diverse transformation project successfully.

That’s one reason why ITIL 4, the latest version of AXELOS’s IT service management framework, can help companies with such transformations. “One of the things it does is recognising the need for leadership to get involved in business transformation,” says Basham. “Such a fundamental change to the business is a leadership initiative.” And though it is a fundamental change, with the right goals, plans, skills and leadership, even traditional companies can keep up with the digital age.

91,How to be an agile business: lessons from TransferWise and Farmdrop,Emma Sheppard,"Farmdrop’s move to home delivery has helped the company grow, and this success is built on investment in IT infrastructure. Photograph: Miles Willis

When ethical grocer Farmdrop first launched in 2012, founder Ben Pugh wanted to create an online farmers’ market connecting customers with producers selling local, seasonal food. In terms of technology, it wasn’t terribly sophisticated – customers would log on, place an order and pick it up at an allotted time each week at a nominated “drop” spot, often a local pub, town hall, school or cafe.

It was an interesting concept, but one that was slow to take off. “We just weren’t growing at the rate we wanted to, to become sustainable as a business,” marketing manager Damian Hind says. “It was when we decided to move to home delivery that the service became all the more compelling and customers were much more interested.”

How two decades of digitalisation has changed business – and why it shows no sign of stopping Read more

Central to that pivot and the subsequent success of the business, which recently raised £10m from investors including the founder of Skype, has been Farmdrop’s evolving IT infrastructure. There are four platforms that control the supply chain: one used by the producers and farmers, who can see orders in real time and decide when to harvest and where they need to redistribute stock; one for customers to place and track orders; another for the distribution hub that will repackage produce arriving each day into individual orders; and an app that generates the quickest route for drivers and stores information about each drop-off (such as if a customer has a dog, for example).

The UK’s technology sector has attracted record levels of investment in recent years – in 2017, the £3bn secured in venture capital funding was almost double the previous year’s total, with giants such as Deliveroo, TransferWise and Monzo all closing significant rounds. But research from online payment software provider Stripe has found that seven out of 10 UK developers say that outdated technology systems are holding their businesses back.

Globally, technological capability plays an increasingly important role in a business’s ability to grow and innovate. According to research conducted by Stripe, almost two-thirds (61%) of the business leaders they surveyed (who span six different countries), rank access to developer talent as more important for success than access to capital (56%). Almost half (44%) of the developers surveyed believe the companies they work for are too slow to react to technology trends.

Over 80% of traditional enterprises are in the midst of a transformation or starting a transformation programme Margo Leach, AXELOS

Integrating that expertise is something that AXELOS chief product officer Margo Leach says is critical for businesses to thrive, regardless of their size. The joint venture company, set up by the UK government and Capita, is responsible for setting best practice guidelines for the IT, project management and cyber resilience sectors. One of its frameworks, ITIL, is used by millions of professionals all around the world. It aims to equip IT teams with the skills to deliver continuous value for customers and support seamless digital transformation. It also helps align IT services with the needs of business, which is something that many organisations struggle with. By helping businesses build a foundation of solid IT and digital services, ITIL can support organisational agility, which is key to successful transformation.

“Our research shows that more than 80% of traditional enterprises are in the midst of a transformation or starting a transformation programme,” says Leach. “Digital disruption is a constant state, and so is change. To create a business that can survive and thrive, you’ve got to have your fundamentals down. Successful transformations are built on solid foundations of good business practices, excellent customer service, and a culture that is prepared for and embracing of change. These solid foundations allow organisations to pivot and adapt when needed. Guidance, such as ITIL, provides a framework to help organisations operate effectively, and continue to deliver value to their customers, even through times of significant disruption. It also provides guidance to help organisations to maximise the opportunities new technologies and ways or working bring.”

At TransferWise, its 30 product teams are each focused on a problem the company is trying to solve and each is multi-disciplinary – there are developers, business development managers, designers and product managers all working together. The firm’s head of business, Stuart Gregory, says this approach, coupled with a significant amount of investment in technology infrastructure, has accelerated the firm’s growth. Since its launch in 2011, TransferWise now has 1,200 employees, spread across offices in nine countries, and four million customers that send £3bn in international payments each month.

“The insight that kicked it all off was that bank transfers were very slow, very expensive, plus it was hard to know what the exchange rate was, and the fees hidden in it,” Gregory says. Because it’s turned out to be quite a complicated problem to solve, some bank brands, including startup Monzo and BPCE, the second-largest banking group in France, are partnering with the disruptor to facilitate their own international payments, rather than invest in their own functionality.

“Realistically, for a lot of these banks, international transfers aren’t their primary focus,” says Gregory. “We’ve got more than 1,200 people all focused on solving this problem.”

His advice to digital disruptors is to seek out a similar issue that no one is addressing. “You need to find that one thing that you can do better with technology – a big enough problem that enough people struggle with, that you can meaningfully solve in a way that’s 10 times better than the incumbent solutions. The big benefit of doing that is, if you’re able to really disrupt that space, and use technology to completely transform the experience, then people will talk about it. TransferWise’s growth is based on our customers recommending it to friends and family. That means it’s scaled and it keeps on scaling.”

Leach agrees, but warns that while the opportunities provided by new technologies are incredibly important, they won’t guarantee success if you don’t have your basics in order.

“The biggest mistake businesses make is thinking technology is the solution itself,” she says. “It’s exciting to talk about tech, but you cannot forget your basics. Who is your customer? What value do you bring to them, and how do you deliver it? Are they finding it difficult, or even painful, to do business with you?

“If you’ve got these fundamentals down, you can leverage technology to enhance your business – to work faster and delight your customer – but you can’t do that without those fundamentals in place.”

92,How two decades of digitalisation has changed business – and why it shows no sign of stopping,Alison Coleman,"James Reed, chairman of recruitment firm Reed, recalls, as a child, queuing with his mother at the bank and being so bored, until ATMs made it possible to access cash at any time – day or night – without waiting around.

“Similarly, when it came to job hunting, I knew there was a quicker, more effective way for people looking for their next role,” he says. “I could see immediately that the internet was the perfect tool for people to look for jobs in their own time, whenever and wherever they wanted, and so reed.co.uk was born.” In 1995, reed.co.uk became the first recruitment website offered by a recruitment agency in the UK, and within two years the online portal became a prime source of applicants for the business. Initially built to find and hire talent for the recruitment agency itself, in 2007 reed.co.uk became a fully fledged business in its own right.

Reed was founded in 1960 when Sir Alec Reed, then aged 26, opened the first office in his hometown of Hounslow with just £75, which came from cashing in his pension. Online technology has revolutionised the way that many large traditional companies such as Reed operate.

“It has enabled us to greatly increase our reach and to serve much larger audiences,” says Reed. “It has also accelerated the recruitment process, with the net result that we have been able to source many more candidates for our clients much quicker than we’d been able to do previously.”

As chief executive of AXELOS, which creates and accredits guidance and qualifications for IT professionals, Mark Basham has witnessed much of the digital disruption that is reshaping how business processes and practices have changed in recent years.

“Technologies such as the cloud and the evolution of software as a service (SaaS) into everything as a service (XaaS), and the opportunities they provide for fast scaling, have had the biggest impact on business, while smartphone and mobile app technologies have transformed customer interactions, raising speed and expectations of service to new levels,” he says. “This has meant massive change for companies.”

And this need for businesses to keep pace with new technologies doesn’t show any sign of letting up. “Our data scientists are using machine learning to increase the accuracy of relevant job search results,” adds Reed. “We are also working on developing artificial intelligence solutions in CV screening to help eliminate unconscious bias, so that all CVs will be evaluated consistently.”

It’s difficult to identify an industry whose business operations have not been profoundly altered by new technologies. With a manufacturing history spanning more than 100 years, Formica Group Europe has seen huge technological changes and embraced many of them. Last year, the company launched a £40m investment plan that will include the implementation of the latest technology to create a state-of-the-art laminate manufacturing plant in the UK.

CEO Peter Rush says: “A lot of the investment has gone into automating our product line, refreshing our product offer with substantial innovation on the NPD [new product development] front. While we are a manufacturing business, we’re also a design-led, innovative company and we’ve funded a lot of new product research that includes launching highly technical innovations using nanotechnology.”

With modern manufacturing advancing rapidly, thanks largely to the development of new technologies, the skill set required is also evolving. Many of Formica Group Europe’s 500-plus employees are finding their roles are being altered as a result.

“As we move forward, we want roles to be less transactional but more entrepreneurial,” says Rush. “Technology and data are critical to the operations of almost all corporate functions, and as digitisation evolves we continue to train and recruit staff with the technical skills or experience to get things done, rather than rely solely on IT.”

The consumer storage industry is not renowned for being a high-tech sector. However, being a logistics provider as well as a storage space provider, Lovespace is a company that has recognised the importance of tech innovation to remaining competitive, and has developed a new platform capable of delivering on rising consumer demands.

Secure, speedy and at scale: how to ensure your future's bright in the cloud Read more

Dave Walker, director of technology, says: “The platform can track each unique item from the customer’s home, through all stages of its movements, inside and around storage facilities, and back to the customer. Most other logistics services are only just starting to achieve this level of transparency.”

Lovespace is now exploring the idea of using smart boxes that are internet-of-things (IoT) connected and GPS-tracked.

Digital transformation is now evident in all industry sectors, and being rolled out across growing numbers of organisations. However, as Basham points out, to be successful it has to be led from the top, not driven by the IT team.

“The IT team understands the need for agility and the need for the technology that will facilitate that, but other departments are less comfortable with the prospect of the change it will bring,” he says. “Therefore, it falls to strong leadership from the board to engage the organisation with digital transformation, and bring everyone on the journey.”

93,‘The move to the cloud has liberated me’: three CIOs on their evolving roles,Nicole Kobie,"Linda Jewell, CIO, Arizona Department of Child Safety

Linda Jewell can’t let down her customers: children needing support in Arizona. “There are a lot of systems to support child welfare, that’s my charge,” she says, noting that it’s a balance between building new capabilities and what she refers to as “the run” – the day-to-day maintenance such as keeping networks operational and data secure. “I certainly prefer the strategy side to the run side – it’s more fun.”

Part of Jewell’s strategic work is reacting to legislative changes. “I can make recommendations or assess the impact that they will have on the data we collect, whether it’s privacy or sharing of information,” she explains. But four years ago, an even larger project was placed on her desk: fully separating her department from another agency, which housed all its IT systems. That came alongside new federal rules around reporting and maintenance of child-welfare systems. “We took that opportunity to look at what the pain points were,” she says.

Linda Jewell

One major issue was mobility. Previously, the agency ran on a 20-year-old mainframe system, with caseworkers going out with papers on clipboards to meet with families – not very secure or convenient for staff. Looking to solve that “big problem with a small technical footprint”, the agency switched to mobile first, providing tablets to caseworkers to hold their files and input data. “That’s led to a bigger shift into the cloud; the agency has no on-premises solutions at all,” Jewell says.

Such a project wouldn’t be possible without supportive leadership, she notes, but it would have been equally impossible to get the funding if the caseworkers weren’t doing such a good job. “I like to say I’m riding on the coat-tails of their success,” she says. “We needed to technically advance in the agency to bring modern solutions to old government problems, but no one is going to fund an agency if it isn’t doing well.”

Is AI the new electricity? Read more

The work of a CIO has changed, with more focus on the strategy and capability aspects that Jewell prefers, and less on maintaining networks and offering technical support, although such work remains necessary. Jewell says the biggest shift in her role has been hiring; no longer does she look for staff with a specific skill set.

“Technology changes so fast that we really have to change the paradigm of how we hire,” she says. “We have to hire attitude, and … keep them trained and not expect them to come with these skill sets that are outdated by the time they walk through the door.”

Running technology for a government agency is less about technology and more about ideas – so hiring diverse people is key. “I try to surround myself with people who don’t think like I do,” she says. “We’ve had three years of complete transformation; we wouldn’t have been able to do that if everyone thought the same.”

Asked to identify a favourite quote to inspire the next generation of IT leaders, Jewell selects a Steve Jobs line: “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.”

John Gillespie, CIO, Amnesty International

John Gillespie sees his role not as providing technology, but solutions, to the human rights organisation. “The role is bringing all the power and magic of information technology to Amnesty International and, more particularly, the campaign for better human rights,” he says.

John Gillespie

To him, the core of the CIO role is understanding what technology is available and how that can solve the organisation’s challenges – as well as doing the hard engineering and technical work to make that magic happen. That’s a shift from a CIO’s traditional remit of keeping computing systems up and running to support a business, and it’s a change Gillespie welcomes. “The hard work of the past 20 years means that the underlying technology is no longer where you need to spend your time and effort,” he says. “The move to the cloud has liberated me and my colleagues from hands-on managing a lot of technology.”

Amnesty has outposts in more than 50 countries, making it difficult for staff in each of those locations to collaborate effectively. “If we’re to be more effective at campaigning for human rights, we need to work as one movement, and technology is a key enabler for that,” he says. To help, Gillespie and his team rolled out a central shared service using Microsoft Office 365 as the base, so all Amnesty staff around the world have access to the same collaboration platforms, tools, documents and, perhaps most importantly, information.

While keeping systems running is a necessary part of the job, Gillespie wants Amnesty colleagues to see his team as problem solvers, not PC fixers, helping them think through how they can use information and technology to make a difference to the organisation and its mission. “A great day here is when someone comes back and says your brilliant team helped us think through and solve a business problem, not just that they helped me fix my computer.”

Indeed, Gillespie and his team directly help with Amnesty’s core goals of improving human rights around the world. One of his more innovative projects is examining the use of big data and artificial intelligence to help his colleagues find and understand data outside the organisation. “We’re looking at how we can access and then analyse huge streams of publicly available data to find evidence of human rights abuses,” he says. “There are huge amounts of data being collected about us, about everything that goes on in the world, and with the power of machine learning and AI to extract insights out of that, hopefully it can be used to benefit us as citizens.”

His chosen quote to sum up the role for the next generation? “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex … it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.” EF Schumacher, economist and author of Small is Beautiful.

Vishy Narayanan, chief digital officer, PwC Australia

As chief digital officer for PwC in Australia, Vishy Narayanan has recently subsumed the CIO role, a reorganisation sparked by the consulting giant’s shift to the cloud. “That essentially replaces the need for quite a lot of our legacy infrastructure,” he says. “The traditional model of managing our infrastructure and our legacy technology footprint was no longer as significant a role.” Plus, the dual role helps Narayanan do his job more efficiently, by giving him oversight across the entire technology division.

Vishy Narayanan

That said, it’s a busy job. His current work includes finishing up a wide-ranging security programme – an 18-month project – and expanding PwC’s data analytics platforms to make the insights it creates more easily available across the business.

And then there’s the two-part digital IQ programme for employees. The first part is a tech assessment sent out to the entire workforce, which gives staff a score on their digital fitness and personalised training to fill in any gaps. The second aspect is a “digital accelerator”, which gives groups of partners training in cutting-edge tech such as AI or user experience, so they can bring those skills into their work. “The focus of the past two to three years has been investing in our technology footprint,” he says. “How are we going to leverage that as a business and make sure that every single one of our 8,000 strong workforce benefits from that investment?”

Just as PwC partners will see their work shift with technology, so too does the job of a CIO, says Narayanan. “The role changes quite often, and there’s no set pattern,” he says. Narayanan uses a trio of compass points to help him navigate the changing landscape of technology, which he dubs the “three Cs”.

They are: keeping the customer at the heart of everything; having an element of collaboration or connectivity; and keeping it commercially viable — because “someone needs to be willing to pay for it”, he says.

Keeping PwC at that cutting edge of technology is important because the company needs to practise what it preaches to clients, adds Narayanan. “I describe my role as helping to bridge the sort of reality gap or authenticity gap between what we tell our clients to do and what we have to do ourselves.” In other words, Narayanan and his team prove what’s possible.

And his quote? “Be passionate and bold. Always keep learning. You stop doing useful things if you don’t learn.” Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.

94,Scenic cycling routes in Europe: readers’ tips,Guardian Readers,"Winning tip: Three countries round Lake Constance

Cycling round all or part of Lake Constance delivers maximum scenic delights for minimum effort. September is an ideal month to experience the flat, car-free Bodensee-Radweg cycle path (total length 260km). You will see snow-capped Alps to the south, terraced vineyards, apple orchards and onion-domed churches. It takes in the fairytale medieval town of Meersburg, the Unesco-listed monastery of St Gallen, and the famous lion guarding Lindau’s harbour. Campsites abound, as do lakeside resorts such as Überlingen. Ferries crisscross the lake if time is short, and afterwards you can boast that you’ve cycled three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Ponga, Asturias, Spain

A great way to experience the northern Spanish peaks of Asturias is a loop around the Ponga natural park. Leave the car at the first (free) car park on the AS261 (near the N625 junction) and take your bike anti-clockwise right around the park. The scenery is breathtaking, initially following the Ponga river, and passing through villages as you climb up to get a better view of the mountains. We had a delicious Asturian lunch at Fonda Ponga (no website) near San Juan de Beleño, where we could prop our bikes by picnic benches. Don’t eat too much as the biggest climb is still to come and the most dramatic views. Then it’s downhill all the way. Rejoin the N625 at San Ignacio for a quick spin back to the car.

Wallonia, southern Belgium, is a beautiful region with excellent cycling opportunities. A non-taxing “taster” might be to follow a stretch (around 30km) along the meandering e Semois River, surrounded by lush wooded hills, You could start with a visit to the Abbaye d’Orval in Florenville, perhaps sampling the Trappist monks’ beer and cheese. Setting off north-west along the well-signposted route, you’ll want to stop after only 4km to visit Chassepierre, one of the “most beautiful Wallonian villages”. Then ride on through the quiet valley to explore the medieval town of Bouillon with its fortified castle.

The Lac d’Hourtin-Carcans area is full of cycle routes through pristine sand dunes covered in pine forests. There are many places to stay in the area that have direct access to the routes, but my favourite is Camping de la Dune Bleue (from €14 a night) in the forest with access to the lake. My favourite route is to Lacanau-Océan further down the coast, as you can take a circular route and rarely encounter any roads or any other people apart from cyclists. Stay at the campsite, leave your car in the car park and cycle everywhere. Awesome!

Normandy, France

Finding ourselves in Avranches with a few days to kill, we hired bikes from Ouibike (from €20 a day) and took a pleasant 24km downhill trip towards Mont Saint-Michel. The journey started with picturesque French countryside then stunning sea views and finally the amazing site of Mont Saint-Michel, from it’s abbey and monastery up top, through the Great Hall in the middle to the fishermen’s houses at the bottom. We were told the best views were at dusk so spent the night at La Mère Poulard (doubles from €200 B&B, cheaper places available). Of course, as the trip here was downhill the return wasn’t - but it just meant taking it a little slower and relishing the fuel provided by the legendary soufflé omelette.

Valtellina, Italy

Last stop before the Swiss border in Lombardy is this valley where a family-friendly cycle route follows the river Adda for 114km from the mountain town of Bormio to Lake Como. Weaving through meadows, villages, vines and orchards, almost the entire route is traffic free. It’s clearly waymarked, the map is detailed and one-way bike hire works well with seven rental points. We took the train to Tirano, hired bikes and cycled gently downhill to Colico, a full day’s pedalling. As well as regular picnic spots, there are plenty of dining and sleeping options en route - our favourite was La Fiorida agriturismo (doubles from €102 B&B) with a fab farm shop and an air of rustic luxury.

The Bay of Kotor is a huge fjord-like inlet on the coast of Montenegro. Cruising the road that hugs the shoreline by bike is a perfect way to see it from all angles. This is definitely a route for leisurely cycling: you’ll pass plenty of tempting waterside bars and cafes, and perfect spots for a dip in the clear blue water. The route is around 26 miles including a short ferry crossing at the narrowest part of the bay. There are plenty of places to hire bikes in Kotor town.

For an exhilarating downhill ride with breathtaking scenery, this sublime 80km mountain-to-fjords road route runs alongside the Bergensbanen and Flåmsbanen railway lines, so is easily accessible by train from Bergen or Oslo. One day adventurers alight at Finse, Norway’s highest railway station, at 1222 metres, and hire a bike from a shop right on the platform (finse1222.co.no, £68 a day). From the stunning Hallingskarvet mountain backdrop to the picturesque Aurlandsfjord, navigating steep hairpin bends to freewheeling past traditional farms, this 57km descent to Flåm does not disappoint. For refreshment try rallarvafler (waffles) from the Fagernut railway cottage and refill your bottle in a pristine stream.

Cycle route 46 on the 200km Tour du Leman (around Lake Geneva, straddling France and Switzerland) is great for families: mostly along flat, quiet country roads and agricultural paved paths, with great views of the Alps and Jura mountains. It can be adapted for all levels of ability: you can climb higher on some stretches, or take the frequent train and ferry services between, say, Geneva, Lausanne and the delightful French spa town of Évian-les-Bains, to complete shorter legs. Flower-bedecked towns and villages to visit along the way include Yvoires and Montreux. Cycling clockwise will keep you closest to the lake.

The Inn cycle path follows the River Inn for over 500km from its source above St Moritz in Switzerland all the way to Germany where it meets the Danube. We hired from Crazy Bikez in Innsbruck and spent five days cycling the path’s Austrian section, which was well-signed, predominantly traffic-free, and though the vistas were massive snow-capped peaks, the ride itself was free of any great ascents. The trip took us past medieval castles and fortresses, churches and monasteries. While in Tyrol make sure you visit one or two of their schnapps distilleries.

95,Hidden Tokyo: share your videos of your favourite quiet place 隠れた東京：一番のお気に入りの静かな場所を撮ったビデオを共有してください,Guardian Readers,"In the world’s most populous city, we want to hear from locals about where you go to get away from the crowds

When most people think about Tokyo, images of crowds often spring to mind: the ‘pushers’ who squeeze passengers on to packed rush-hour trains, or waves of pedestrians spilling across the Shibuya Crossing intersection. Even with Japan’s shrinking population, the capital is by far the most populous city in the world, home to 37 million people.

97,'Rolling out the red carpet is a disgrace': readers on Trump's state visit,Guardian Readers,"‘Surely an unprecedented move in the history of diplomacy?’

Absolutely despicable for a visiting head of state to arrive in a country and directly insult the mayor of its capital city before they’ve even left their gigantic phallus of an aircraft. Surely an unprecedented and boorish move in the history of diplomacy? Jeremy Hunt’s spineless deflection of this insult reveals how far the UK has fallen – how far, indeed, the Tories are willing to go on putting up with this humiliating farce.

Trump attacks Sadiq Khan as he lands in UK for state visit Read more

That the US is demanding the NHS be on the table in a post-Brexit trade deal is the most damning verdict yet on this decade of Tory misrule.

The fact Trump has brought along his family, who, by all accounts, seem to consider meeting the inordinately dull Windsors to be the highlight of this visit, tells us everything about the tackiness of his brood. Not least, their shameless fantasy of becoming the reigning dynasty of an American monarchy. Macademiac

‘That the British state has rolled out the red carpet for Trump in this way is a total disgrace’

That the British state has rolled out the red carpet for Trump in this way is a total disgrace. Worse, it is politically and strategically inept. If the UK were a party, people would be tearing up their membership cards in disgust and dismay at how it has lost its way. Thank goodness it isn’t, and the people of Britain have a reason to stay and turn back the tide. DavidLoveday

‘By what possible measure is Trump “the leader of the free world”’?’

By what possible measure is Trump “the leader of the free world” as described by Hunt? That’s a description that should not be automatically applied, when the facts don’t warrant it. Trump is not leading the free world, the free world is ignoring him on so many levels, from global warming, to trade, to diplomatic policy. Bart1785

‘It is outrageous that so many public figures in Britain are allowing this vile creep into England’

To expand on what another person has said here, thank you Mayor Sadiq Khan for saying publicly what most private citizens think about the dreadful and repulsive Trump. It is outrageous that so many public figures in Britain are allowing this vile creep into England to insult all and sundry. More strength to your arm and your speech, Mr Kahn. Kohanga16

‘Trump being invited to attend D-day commemorations is an insult to all who fought’

I’ve never been so ashamed to be British. That we are rolling out the red carpet for this vile individual makes me want to vomit. That a draft dodger who thinks Neo Nazis are “very fine people” is invited to attend D-day commemorations is an insult to all who fought. The fact that he is president does not entitle him to a state visit. Watching the Tories kowtowing and licking their lips that they’ll now be able to sell off the NHS to him is the lowest that party has ever fallen – and that’s saying something. dizzyweg

‘It’s totally appropriate for Labour to boycott’

Hunt also said, “I agree with him that it is totally inappropriate for the Labour party to be boycotting this incredibly important visit. This is the president of the United States.”

Personally, I think it’s totally appropriate. Being president doesn’t entitle him to a state visit, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to count the number of them who’ve had one on one hand. The invitation was ludicrous in the first place and Trump’s shown himself to be undeserving of any respect regardless of the title he has. If anything, he’s devalued the presidency to the point where it’ll be hard to take the next office holder seriously. UniversallyCynic

‘This man is an anomaly, he is not the America I know’

Remember previous visits, some state occasions, some business, by US presidents? All, at the time, probably the most powerful men in the world. All courteous, wearing that strength and power with dignity, respect and a sense of responsibility. Over the years I have agreed with some, such as Obama, and disagreed with some, such as GW Bush. But I have never been contemptuous of an American president until Donald Trump. He lands slinging insults and taking partisan positions in local affairs, he doesn’t give a damn about anything. He brings his whole family for an electioneering photoshoot. I love America, I have worked there and I have travelled widely on both coasts and in the middle. This man is an anomaly, he is not the America I know. He is a disgrace and he must soon be over with. AlanP10

‘We need to keep him onside, even if his policies are often wrong, or awful’

While Trump remains a ‘divisive’ (ahem...) figure, he does represent NATO, which is our most important military alliance. An alliance in which the democracies, particularly Western democracies, rely upon to defend ourselves from those who oppose democracy. It is vital particularly at the time of the D-day commemorations to remind Trump that the cost of undermining NATO could rebound on the US as well as Europe. The death of so many shows that we must not risk our hard won peace by alienating Trump who in turn could undermine NATO.

We may have to hold our noses when Trump visits, but he does represent the most powerful and important defensive alliance in the world. We need to keep him onside; even if his policies are often myopically short-sighted, blinkered, wrong, or awful.

129,Kirk Weddle's best photograph: Nirvana's Nevermind swimming baby,Tim Jonze,"It’s such a great concept: a baby underwater, naked, defenceless, can’t breathe, but still going after the dollar on a fishhook. Nirvana’s record label, Geffen, came to me with the idea. I was marketing myself as the underwater photography guy at the time. But when they asked me to shoot the sleeve [for Nevermind] I had no idea whether I could do it. Shooting a baby was new for me. I really didn’t want to drown the little guy!

I was lucky that my friends had just had a baby, Spencer, and they trusted me with him. The band weren’t on anyone’s radar at that point, so the shoot was really small-scale – there was no art director, no manager or account executive looking over your shoulder.

I think I got $1,000 to shoot it – that was for everything, including the gear and the cost of another rescue diver. I had a snorkel and an underwater camera on a tripod. First, we trained on a doll. Then we took the little guy, blew a little air into his face and eased him into the water. Dad gave him a small shove, he drifted by the camera – bang, bang, bang, bang, bang – I shot off five frames. Mum pulls him out, he’s cool, so we go again. Put him in – bang, bang, bang, bang, bang – he starts to cry, “OK, we’re done!” We ended up with about 25 frames. It took an hour to set up and five minutes to do.

I knew I had the shot. That’s the thing about old-school photography – as a pro, you have to know that you’ve got it before you leave. But when I looked at it more closely I had some doubts. I thought, “Man, it’s such a dick shot!” His unit was so prominent in the picture … he’s a well hung kid for a four-month old, you know? I didn’t know if the label would go for it. So I went to a kids’ swim school and got half a dozen other babies in the water. This one girl was 10 months old, she could really motor, so I shot her from the side. But the label loved the original shot of Spencer and went with that.

I used to think, Man, when that kid is 16 he’s gonna hate my guts. He doesn’t, but he is conflicted because everybody made money off it and he didn’t

A guy in New York shot the dollar bill. I wish that I’d done that part, too. It would have been easy, but I didn’t care at the time. I’m just glad I didn’t have to capture it all in one shot. It’s one thing to drown the kid, but another to stick him on a fishhook!

I’m still in contact with Spencer. I used to think, “Man, when that kid is 16 he’s gonna hate my guts!” He doesn’t, but he’s conflicted about the picture. He feels that everybody made money off it and he didn’t. I think he deserves something. But it’s always the record labels that make the money.

When Spencer was 10, I recreated the image with him for Rolling Stone. He’s done it a few times since with another shooter, which I don’t like! But we’ve got a good relationship, and I’m still tight with his parents. I still notice new things in the picture. Recently, I realised that you can see a handprint on Spencer’s chest. If you look closely – that’s his dad’s handprint!

For a while after that shot I was the golden child. People were like, ‘Hey, everything we do should be underwater!’ But the work was sporadic, and it’s a tough medium to work in. The model can’t see or hear you, it’s hard to direct, everything is super slow, it’s like having your feet in mud.

I even ended up shooting the band underwater a few months after this shot. That was a hairy job. Looking back, I could have done things differently. I thought 10am would be a nice time of day for them, but of course if you’re in a band it’s not – they were pissed off when they turned up. It was a rare cold, grey day in California, and there were problems with the pool so that was cold, too. The band hadn’t been told about it, so they were, like, “We’ve got to get in the water?” And then the label didn’t like the shots – they wanted something slicker. They said: “We don’t like Kurt Cobain’s hair!” I thought, man, there ain’t nothing I can do about his hair! But those images are really popular now.

Of course, if I’d shot this for some band that never went anywhere we wouldn’t be talking about it now – it’d just be a cool picture in a filing cabinet. It’s a big deal to a lot of people, but not to me. I’m proud of how it turned out, but I don’t sit around looking at it. Having said that, I’m going to recreate the image again this summer. I want to shoot a girl diving into a pool, going after a cellphone – because every teenage girl I ever see now is on their phone. I’d also like to shoot Spencer again, but with him totally naked like in the original. He’s 27 now, and has some really good tats these days. Maybe I should call him up.

Kirk Weddle’s CV

Born: “USA, 1959. I have always moved a lot and I don’t really have a home town.”

Training: “Photography Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Then about 10 years of assisting other photographers – that’s where I really earned my chops.”

Influences: “I get a lot of inspiration from the people I photograph. When I work with someone who’s interesting and well rounded with passion, its contagious.”

High point: “When I make an image that I think is really strong and I like it and other people get it, too.”

Low point: “When I’m not available for a gig and and the client says, ‘Oh don’t worry, I’ll use my phone.’”

Top tip: “Keep your eyes open, and be ready.”

130,Led not into temptation: pope approves change to Lord's Prayer,Harriet Sherwood,"New wording for Catholics asks God not to ‘let us fall into temptation’

Its words are memorised by Christian children all over the world and repeated at almost every act of Christian worship: “Our Father, who art in heaven … ”

Now Pope Francis has risked the wrath of traditionalists by approving a change to the wording of the Lord’s Prayer. Instead of saying “lead us not into temptation”, it will say “do not let us fall into temptation”.

The new wording was approved by the general assembly of the Episcopal Conference of Italy last month. It will appear in the third edition of the Messale Romano, the liturgical book that contains the guiding texts for mass in the Roman Catholic church.

The pope said in 2017 he believed the wording should be altered.

“It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation,” he told Italian TV. “I am the one who falls. It’s not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen.

“A father doesn’t do that; a father helps you to get up immediately. It’s Satan who leads us into temptation – that’s his department.”

According to the Bible, Jesus taught the words to his disciples when they asked him how they should pray.

Some have expressed concern about changes to the wording. Meredith Warren, a lecturer in biblical and religious studies at Sheffield University, said: “This new version of the Lord’s Prayer tries to avoid implying that God has some hand in evil.

“But in doing so the pope not only overlooks the many biblical examples where God works with the devil to tempt his followers and even his own son. The new version actually goes against the plain meaning of the Greek of the gospel text.”

After French bishops altered the words in 2017, Philip Lawler, the editor of Catholic World News, a conservative website, said the change was “very upsetting” because the prayer was so deeply ingrained.

“Pope Francis has made a habit of saying things that throw people into confusion, and this is one of them,” he told the New York Times. “It just makes you wonder, where does it stop?

What’s up for grabs? It’s cumulative unease.”

The Catholic church in England and Wales said it had no immediate plans to change the wording. “The Lord’s Prayer has been changed in the Italian language – there are no plans at present for it to change in English,” a spokesperson said.

“Each language will be studied to see the specific meaning and understanding of the language. I am sure there will be some consultation with the English-speaking nations.”

Anglican worshippers can choose between traditional and contemporary versions of the prayer, but both include the words “lead us not into temptation”.","Instead of saying “lead us not into temptation”, it will say “do not let us fall into temptation”.

Yet, only two thirds – 66% – of online daters say they have actually gone on a date with someone they’ve met through a dating site or app. So what’s stopping the other third from meeting up? It could come down to the quality of conversation in the early stages of chatting online. Sometimes it’s hard to tell how genuine someone’s questions are, or how deep their interest lies. They say ‘hi’, you reply. But then it’s radio silence. So you reply again, “Hello?”, still nothing. Other times, you’ve been chatting away for weeks, but pinning down a date for that first big meet proves impossible. Sound familiar? Here are some tips for sorting the frank from the fickle.

1. They’ve replied to your initial message

It might sound obvious, but if you’ve sent a message to someone whose dating bio you like the look of, but they haven’t replied, it’s probably a no-go. 94 percent of online daters say they expect a response to their message within 24 hours of sending it. So if you’re holding out for a response from Suzi, 36 who you messaged over a week ago, don’t. She probably has her hazel eyes and quirky hair cut set on other sites. It’s time to message someone else.

2. Their messages include all the right signals

Professional flirting coach Gene Smith uses the acronym ‘FLIG’ to explain how you can tell if someone is flirting with you. Smith’s example refers to meeting people in person, however her principles can be applied to online dating too. ‘F’ stands for frequency; how often are you chatting to this person online? ‘L’ is for length; how long are the conversations you’re having with them? The ‘I’ refers to intensity – you want the conversation to have a level of intensity that you feel comfortable with. It goes without saying that you should be wary of anyone you meet online who seems overly pushy to meet up straight away. The ‘G’ is for gesture, which in Smith’s example refers to body language. Here, however, you could interpret gesture as whether or not they show willing to meet up for a date.

37% of couples who met online chatted for a week before going on their first date. If you find you’re chatting to someone who’s all questions and flirty comments, but seems hesitant to hatch a meet-up plan, it’s probably time to move on.

3. You plan your second date on your first

If you’ve already been on a first date, and everything seemed to go well, you might be wondering how, or when, to broach the topic of date number two. You might also be surprised to learn that 77% of couples planned their second date during the first date, so our advice here is to waste no time. If you feel like you enjoyed each other’s company and you can potentially see a romantic future together, suggest a second meeting. It doesn’t matter if you’re male or female – it’s the twenty-first century; embrace your freedom to propose another date.

Perhaps you’re reading through this article feeling like none of this advice applies to you yet, because you’re currently getting nowhere whatsoever with online dating. Your experience thus far has involved sending umpteen initial messages and receiving zero replies. If this sounds familiar, it might be worth revisiting your dating profile. A recent survey conducted by Paired Life found that 55% of online daters believe the most important aspect of an online dating profile is the ‘about me’ section. So it’s definitely worth putting some time into this; be authentic and make sure you give enough information about yourself and your interests. Your pictures are important too, with 45% of people surveyed claiming pictures are most important to them. If all your pictures are fuzzy or somehow failing to show you in your best light, you might want to book a photoshoot with a professional like Saskia Nelson, who specialises in photography for dating profiles. And, if you’re not sure what counts as a good or bad photo, read our article on the dating profile photos no one wants to see.

Above all, keep going with it and good luck.

208,The three photos every online dating profile should have,Saskia Nelson,"With the number of people dating online growing every day, we have literally nanoseconds to impress potential dates with our dating profiles. Good quality photos are a sure-fire way to catch people’s attention. But choosing the right dating photos can seem like a minefield – there’s so much conflicting information around. Group shots? Party snaps? Photos of us doing impressive extreme sports? (For the record… it’s a big fat no to all of these). I’m Saskia and I founded Hey Saturday, the world’s first (and coolest) dating photography agency. We’ve worked with hundreds of single people helping them transform their dating profiles. I’m here to give you the definitive guide to the three ‘must have’ photos that’ll make your dating profile stand out from the crowd and win you some hot dates.

1. The close-up headshot

This one’s going first because it’s the most important. Make sure you include a flattering, close-up head and shoulders shot of you smiling. In fact, I’d advise making this shot your main profile photo. It’s been proven that shots where you’re smiling get more ‘likes’ – need I say more? Smiling makes you look fun, engaging, approachable and happy – all attractive traits that will get people’s interest. How do you make sure it’s flattering? Avoid amateur flash – which is known to add seven years to your face. The safest option is to head outdoors and find some nice even light. Avoid direct sunlight though, opting for open shade instead if it’s sunny. Make sure the shot is in sharp focus and the backdrop is interesting (but not distracting) and complements what you’re wearing. Being in a relaxed frame of mind and enjoying a genuine connection with the person taking the photo will also really help you get that natural, flattering smile.

2. The full body shot

Let’s be honest, even in these more enlightened times, both men and women are curious to see the body size, shape and height of anyone they’re looking to date, so the full body shot is the next ‘must have’ photo. It can be a tricky shot to get right. Make sure you keep your pose as natural as possible – looking away from the lens is a good tip, especially for men. Use open body language in all your photos. For example, avoid crossed arms, closed hands or turning in on yourself as it can come across as defensive or sometimes even aggressive, definitely not the vibe you’re looking for in your profile photos. Including a full-body shot signals to people that you’re comfortable in your own skin, you’re genuine and have self-confidence – top traits people look for in a partner. Not including a full body shot could come across as deceptive or lacking in confidence – people are going to see what you look like when you turn up for a date anyway, so why not just own it? Self-love is so important in online dating, which can seem a fickle and superficial business. Embrace who you truly are and be proud of it. Anyone who’s worth getting to know will love you for it.

3. The storytelling shot

Personality is super important in online dating – whether they’re aware of it or not, your matches are instantly picking up clues from your dating photos to help them suss out whether the two of you are compatible. This means you can use your dating photos to tell the story of who you are. Everything in your dating profile photo, from your clothes to the backdrop, is important in building up a mental image of you as a person. Help people to understand what makes you tick and show what makes you unique by doing something interesting in the photo. For example, a great storytelling shot would show you hanging out in your favourite cafe, vintage market or bookshop. It might show you holding items that have meaning for you, such as musical instruments, headphones, books, records or coffee. These shots are usually medium shots (from the waist up), as that allows you to include some context and background. Storytelling images are crucial as they make for a compelling, eye catching dating profile that stands out. They can also provide people with a hook that they can use to write that tricky first message.

209,11 inspiring date ideas in London,Holly O'Mahony,"London’s a huge city with many different neighbourhoods, so it’s easy to feel spammed with choice when planning a date. With this in mind, we’ve compiled a list of inspiring date ideas, to help you avoid the usual overcrowded haunts.

North…

1. Dim the lights at Electric Cinema, Portobello

Fluorescent-coloured Slush Puppies and popcorn-trodden carpets will seem like a distant memory once you’re safely inside Electric Cinema, Portobello. Here, you and your date can hunker down in plush leather armchairs to watch your film of choice. Pay a little extra and you can cosy up on a two-seater sofa, while a little more still could get you one of six double beds in the front row to, er, enjoy the film horizontally? Arrive early to make the most of the auditorium bar which serves wine, beer, Champagne and posh snacks. Tickets don’t come cheap, though, starting at £17.50 for non-members. A cheaper alternative across the city is East London’s independently-run Genesis Cinema.

2. Give each other a hand-up on a climbing wall

Indoor climbing is now a popular sport in London. It’s not only excellent for strengthening your legs, but for giving you a sense of achievement when you complete new routes. Whether you and your date are beginners, experienced climbers, or somewhere in between, taking turns to support each other in ascending the wall could prove a bonding experience, with a few laughs thrown in along the way. The Castle Climbing Centre between Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington offers a range of walls and climbing equipment, as well as a garden where organic produce is grown for the centre’s café.

However if hanging with knees shaking off a vertical drop, while your date shouts words of encouragement from below is your idea of humiliating hell, you could always take a far more relaxing climb up Primrose Hill, and in the warmer months have a picnic up on top.

South…

3. Find culinary inspiration at Italian food heaven

Elephant and Castle’s Mercato Metropolitano has been open for a year now, and steadily the crowds have started to descend. Still, if tucking into some of the finest Italian food in the city (and doing a spot of shopping for home cooking also) is your kind of romantic venture, there’s no better place to do so than in this 45,000sq ft industrial renovation, filled with coffee roasters, charcuterie experts, pizza chefs and more.

4. Explore a new neighbourhood together

Various South London neighbourhoods have had their turn in the spotlight in recent years, after proving themselves up-and-coming destinations. All eyes (and some raised eyebrows) were turned on Tooting most recently, after it was crowned one of the ten coolest neighbourhoods in the world by the Lonely Planet. It’s also the birthplace and dwelling spot of Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. So if you’re not already acquainted with it, why not head to Tooting for your next date? We recommend starting off at Mud, a popular brunch, coffee and cake spot on Mitcham road. Next, wander through Tooting Market; with the likes of Franco Manca rubbing shoulders with long-standing Asian clothing shops, you’ll naturally find yourselves discussing the effects of gentrification. If your views are still relatively in-line with your date’s by the evening, head to Vijaya Krishna for a curry (it’s a favourite of Khan’s) and then to adjacent Little Bar, for a first-class cocktail in a homely setting.

West…

5. Keep things secretive at a speakeasy cocktail bar

If you and your date are fans of donning some gladrags and hopping into the past for an evening, usually by way of drinking in a prohibition era-themed bar that requires you to whisper into walls or recite a riddle to someone you hope is the doorman (and not just an innocent bystander outside what looks like a derelict building), then Evans & Peel could be the perfect place for your next date. This cocktail bar – I mean ‘pharmacy’ – is hidden behind a bookcase. Here you ask for an appointment (table) with a doctor, who will ask you about your case (and prescribe you a drink). But now I’ve said too much …

6. Discuss your favourite authors in a top-notch bookshop

Daunt Books in Marylebone is a beautiful setting to while away some time with a fellow bookworm, and let conversation flow over your favourite works. Alternatively, head to Gay’s The Word, a friendly independent bookstore serving and supporting the LGBT community since 1979.

East…

7. Catch a live performance at Wilton’s Music Hall

If the thought of hearing a live band or seeing a piece of world-class theatre in a Grade II-listed building floats both your boats, there’s no better place to do this than Wilton’s Music Hall. It’s the oldest music hall in the world and offers a regularly-changing programme of events. Both of their wooden-floored, brick-walled bars are effortlessly romantic spots to enjoy a pre or post-performance drink. In fact, if you’re in the area it’s worth visiting to enjoy the bars alone.

8. Cycle through London’s finest natural spots

While cycling on London’s main roads might be a daunting prospect, there are many beautiful routes across the city that would make for a charming daytime date if you’re both keen cyclists. One such route is that between the Olympic Park and Epping Forest. Starting in Hackney Wick, you’ll cycle along the River Lea past colourful houseboats – keep your eyes peeled for the odd one that’s been transformed into a café, where you can stop for a floating cuppa and a refresh. The route will lead you to Epping Forest – the largest public open space in London. Don’t own a bike? No problemo! Santander Cycles (ok, *sigh* Boris Bikes) can be rented for as little as £2. Just don’t forget to make a note of where the nearest docking stations are to your route, as charges go up the longer you keep your bike.

9. Soak up some culture in a historical hotspot

Sutton House is a National Trust property and East London’s oldest house. Built in 1535, the Hackney property dates back to the Tudor era. It’s open to the public for visits, and while the interior of the house is a portal into the past, its events are all about celebrating modern community life. Their current season – Never Gonna Dance Again – is dedicated to celebrating London’s Queer Nightlife and is not to be missed. If you find conversation flowing, why not follow this with a drink at The Cock Tavern, a cheekily named microbrewery close by. And, if you’re hungry but the brewery’s variety of pickled eggs don’t appeal as a bar snack, head to Temple of Seitan, the relatively new but incredibly popular vegan fast food joint which is just around the corner.

Central…

10. Dine together in total darkness

If you’ve seen Richard Curtis’s 2013 rom-com About Time, you’ll probably remember the scene in which the lovers first meet, at the London branch of Parisian restaurant Dans Le Noir. Well the restaurant exists in the real world in London’s Clerkenwell. Here, you and your date will be guided to your table by blind waiters, before dining on a surprise menu in total darkness. Let go of visual stimulation and the usual restaurant distractions (your phone, people watching) and let your other senses guide the conversation for an evening.

11. Tap your feet to live jazz at Ronnie Scott’s

Ronnie Scott’s in Soho is one of the oldest jazz clubs in the world, attracting punters since 1959. With an atmospheric setting and live performances seven nights a week, it’s a popular late night date spot. Whether you’re a jazz hound or an occasional easy listener, you’ll enjoy a swanky, music-fuelled date here. Just remember to book in advance to ensure you get a table and avoid the queues.","London’s a huge city with many different neighbourhoods, so it’s easy to feel spammed with choice when planning a date.

210,Complaints about homeless camps in L.A. have surged. But are cleanups pointless?,Emily Alpert Reyes,"Austin Yi said he couldn’t take it anymore. Noise from the tents along Shatto Place rose to his third-floor Koreatown apartment at night: yelling, screaming, the clanging of tools as people repaired bikes.

When he couldn’t drown out the racket with white noise, the 27-year-old and his wife would drag blankets into the hallway to sleep on the floor. Yi regularly lodged complaints through the city’s 311 system.

""At first I had so much sympathy,” he said, recounting the times he had handed over money or offered to buy food. “Now it changed me. … I wish they would just go away.”

Around the corner from Yi, Fernando Alvarado lamented the items he lost to city sweeps of homeless encampments: His shoes. His identification card. A blanket to ward off the night chill.

The latest sweep, Alvarado said, happened two weeks ago. But he and a few others quickly camped out again in front of a vacant lot on Westmoreland Avenue.

Los Angeles has been deluged with requests to clean up homeless encampments in recent years. Between 2016 and 2018, such requests shot up 167%, according to a Times analysis of 311 data. The trend has continued this year, with requests up 37% in the first few months compared to the same period a year earlier.

The surge in cleanup requests has happened as L.A. and other cities have seen hefty increases in the number of people without permanent shelter. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority announced Tuesday that the homeless population had jumped by 16% in the city and 12% across the county. Most — 75% — were living outdoors, including in vehicles.

City officials say they have relied on complaints to plan cleanups, in part, because there aren’t enough crews to regularly clean the entire city. Homeless activists have denounced that method as arbitrary and are calling for an overhaul of a system they decry as dehumanizing and wasteful.

As complaints have surged, L.A. politicians have faced competing pressures from activists, business owners and residents, spurring fresh soul-searching at City Hall about the sweeps. City Councilman Mike Bonin , whose coastal district includes the homeless hot spot of Venice, recently declared that “it is nearly impossible to find anyone who is satisfied with the result.”

The Times identified more than 100 locations where calls and other 311 service requests became so persistent that the city was responding to complaints weekly for at least five weeks in a row. Such cycles have occurred from the West San Fernando Valley to Venice but were most common downtown, in Hollywood and Koreatown.

One such place is the short stretch of Shatto Place where Yi used to live, around the corner from where Alvarado beds down. The city fielded 172 requests there in just a year and a half.

At the apartment complex that Yi left, property manager Samantha Son has urged tenants to lodge complaints with the city and tracked requests with a spreadsheet. Son worries that the encampments alongside the building are driving away prospective tenants — even though the number of tents has declined in recent months.

“Whenever the people come to visit, they like the unit inside,” said Son, who lives on the second floor. “But then they see the outside and don't come back.”

Across the street, Rev. Gonggun Hwang has heard his congregants complain that they feel unsafe walking to and from the Won Buddhism of Los Angeles temple. One homeless man routinely slept outside the temple’s doors, and Hwang said he has had to repeatedly clean up urine and feces.

“As a Buddhist, I didn’t really want to bother them,” Hwang said. “But I couldn’t help but do something.”

For a while, he turned to 311 to complain. The tents dwindled at times, but didn’t disappear.

Now “I understand they got nowhere to go,” Hwang said. “So I gave up.”

Homeless encampments are only a small fraction of the 311 requests fielded by the city, which are topped by demands to pick up bulky items and clean up graffiti.

But it is the fastest-growing category and presents the city with an expensive and bedeviling challenge. The city budgeted more than $30 million this fiscal year for homeless encampment cleanups and is planning to spend nearly $40 million in the coming year, according to city officials.

A coalition of activists called Services Not Sweeps has launched a campaign to push Mayor Eric Garcetti to scrap the city’s existing system, saying that cleanups shouldn’t be triggered by complaints but be regularly scheduled so homeless people can prepare. They want bins and trash bags provided to people so they can throw out trash before city crews arrive. And they don’t want police on the cleanup teams, as officers are now.

“We can have a system that treats homeless people like something to be cleaned up … or one that deals with the reality that we’re facing,” said Mike Dickerson, an organizer with Ktown for All, a grassroots group that assists and advocates for homeless people in Koreatown and is part of the Services Not Sweeps coalition.

Even some of the people who dial 311 — like Hwang at his temple — are uneasy about the process. Many homeowners and business owners, in turn, are frustrated that the cleanups seem to do little, complaining that tents and trash come back after each sweep.

“Last Tuesday they cleared out, disinfected, painted the side of our building — and by 1 o’clock they’d all moved back,” said Mitch Blumenfeld, vice president of a South L.A. business that sells mannequins, shelving and other fixtures for stores.

“Then Wednesday, we had a fire. What’s going to happen when a building like this goes up in flames and they lose all the revenue?”

Complaints to 311 trigger a step-by-step process: City workers visit the location identified by the requester to check whenter it is really a homeless encampment or just some abandoned items, according to the Bureau of Sanitation. At hot spots like Shatto Place, the city checks on requests in batches on the same days that trash is collected.

If sanitation workers find a mattress or a couch, they can pick it up and reclassify the complaint as a “bulky item” request, according to the department. Hundreds of other complaints are closed on the day of the assessment without a cleanup.

But if homeless people are present, the Bureau of Sanitation needs to get additional approval for a cleanup, including a sign-off from the Homeless Services Authority after it has done outreach. That can take as long as three weeks, according to the city.

“If I could do it quicker, I would. But that outreach component has to be there,” said Jose “Pepe” Garcia, assistant general manager for sanitation.

He added that unlike abandoned couches, homeless camps cannot simply be carted away. L.A. has repeatedly been sued for violating the rights of homeless people, and last year, a federal appeals court ruled that homeless people cannot be punished for sleeping on public property if they have no access to shelter.

On a gray morning, Darryl Dolberry and other members of the authority’s Homeless Engagement Team stopped along a spartan stretch of Alameda Street and 41st Place in South L.A., checking whether anyone was home at a makeshift shelter of tarps and plywood alongside a drab industrial building.

The surge in cleanups has pulled workers such as Dolberry away from their regularly scheduled efforts to proactively reach out to homeless people in assigned neighborhoods, rerouting them to sites slotted for cleanups so they can try to help people before city crews arrive, said Heidi Marston, the achief program officer for the homeless authority.

Dolberry called out and knocked, but no one was there.

The makeshift shelter was the home of Rickey Harris, who later said he had lived on the street for years. Before becoming homeless, Harris said he used to remodel houses in the neighborhood. Now he scrapes by making money with recycling and doing odd jobs.

He had no interest in going to the shelter suggested by outreach workers, saying he might not even get a spot if he went.

Nearby, a flier posted on a telephone pole warned that a cleanup was coming in a few days. City workers are supposed to post a flier 24 to 72 hours in advance, telling homeless people they will have to remove their belongings.

Homeless people also can face “rapid response” teams, which enforce rules against keeping too much personal property on the sidewalks. And if they camp out on private property, they can be ejected without the same warning.

Critics argue that relying on 311 complaints can politicize the cleanup process. In one case publicized by Adrian Riskin, a blogger on MichaelKohlhaas.org, Garcetti aides asked police officials via email to make sure a South L.A. encampment was cleaned up before the mayor visited a construction site in the area.

“There's no attempt at having a plan, so they can use their resources to actually address the problem,” Riskin said. “It looks like it’s a political tactic.”

Garcetti spokesman Alex Comisar said the emails “do not reflect the mayor’s approach to interacting with Angelenos experiencing homelessness, and he was unaware of this exchange.”

Days after the flier went up on the street where Harris lived, nearly a score of city workers arrived at 41st Place to clear his shelter. They came with a trash truck, a flatbed loaded with supplies for a hazardous-waste team, and a front loader to remove trash piled high on the street — some of it likely dumped by local businesses. Police officers blocked the street with their squad cars.

This was all for one man’s ramshackle home.

“Until they find the adequate housing, I’m responsible for who and what is out here,” Garcia said as he watched his crew load broken pallets into a trash truck.

Harris bundled some clothes and other belongings into shopping carts and rolled them over to the next block, where he pulled out some cushions and shut his eyes against the morning cold.

“I couldn’t sleep last night, knowing they was coming,” he said after waking. Yet he was calm, even philosophical. “Ain’t nothing I can do about it. All that negativity pulls all the positive energy.”

A block away, four people in white protective suits and face masks cut back the tarps that covered his home, revealing the things he had left behind: a bed that was made, a pile of folded clothes, instant coffee, a container of Vick’s Vap-O-Rub, rubber sandals, mini flashlights and a Granny Smith apple.

When Harris returned later, it would all be gone, either tossed out or stored elsewhere.

As he chatted with reporters, a young couple greeted him. One neighbor paused in his truck, waiting for Harris to wave. If he doesn’t stop by a local truck for coffee or a breakfast sandwich, Harris said, people ask him, “What’s wrong?”

“I wouldn’t want to move out of this neighborhood,” he said.

Days later, he was back at the same spot where his shelter once stood, sleeping on a cushion flanked by shopping carts.","(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Homeless people set up tents outside the Villa Adobe apartment building in Koreatown.

Los Angeles has been deluged with requests to clean up homeless encampments in recent years. Between 2016 and 2018, such requests shot up 167%, according to a Times analysis of 311 data. The trend has continued this year, with requests up 37% in the first few months compared to the same period a year earlier.

The surge in cleanup requests has happened as L.A. and other cities have seen hefty increases in the number of people without permanent shelter. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority announced Tuesday that the homeless population had jumped by 16% in the city and 12% across the county. Most — 75% — were living outdoors, including in vehicles.

City officials say they have relied on complaints to plan cleanups, in part, because there aren’t enough crews to regularly clean the entire city. Homeless activists have denounced that method as arbitrary and are calling for an overhaul of a system they decry as dehumanizing and wasteful.

As complaints have surged, L.A. politicians have faced competing pressures from activists, business owners and residents, spurring fresh soul-searching at City Hall about the sweeps. City Councilman Mike Bonin , whose coastal district includes the homeless hot spot of Venice, recently declared that “it is nearly impossible to find anyone who is satisfied with the result.”

The Times identified more than 100 locations where calls and other 311 service requests became so persistent that the city was responding to complaints weekly for at least five weeks in a row. Such cycles have occurred from the West San Fernando Valley to Venice but were most common downtown, in Hollywood and Koreatown.

One such place is the short stretch of Shatto Place where Yi used to live, around the corner from where Alvarado beds down. The city fielded 172 requests there in just a year and a half.

At the apartment complex that Yi left, property manager Samantha Son has urged tenants to lodge complaints with the city and tracked requests with a spreadsheet. Son worries that the encampments alongside the building are driving away prospective tenants — even though the number of tents has declined in recent months.

“Whenever the people come to visit, they like the unit inside,” said Son, who lives on the second floor. “But then they see the outside and don't come back.”

Across the street, Rev. Gonggun Hwang has heard his congregants complain that they feel unsafe walking to and from the Won Buddhism of Los Angeles temple. One homeless man routinely slept outside the temple’s doors, and Hwang said he has had to repeatedly clean up urine and feces.

“As a Buddhist, I didn’t really want to bother them,” Hwang said. “But I couldn’t help but do something.”

For a while, he turned to 311 to complain. The tents dwindled at times, but didn’t disappear.

Now “I understand they got nowhere to go,” Hwang said. “So I gave up.”

Homeless encampments are only a small fraction of the 311 requests fielded by the city, which are topped by demands to pick up bulky items and clean up graffiti.

But it is the fastest-growing category and presents the city with an expensive and bedeviling challenge. The city budgeted more than $30 million this fiscal year for homeless encampment cleanups and is planning to spend nearly $40 million in the coming year, according to city officials.

A coalition of activists called Services Not Sweeps has launched a campaign to push Mayor Eric Garcetti to scrap the city’s existing system, saying that cleanups shouldn’t be triggered by complaints but be regularly scheduled so homeless people can prepare. They want bins and trash bags provided to people so they can throw out trash before city crews arrive. And they don’t want police on the cleanup teams, as officers are now.

“We can have a system that treats homeless people like something to be cleaned up … or one that deals with the reality that we’re facing,” said Mike Dickerson, an organizer with Ktown for All, a grassroots group that assists and advocates for homeless people in Koreatown and is part of the Services Not Sweeps coalition.

Even some of the people who dial 311 — like Hwang at his temple — are uneasy about the process. Many homeowners and business owners, in turn, are frustrated that the cleanups seem to do little, complaining that tents and trash come back after each sweep.

“Last Tuesday they cleared out, disinfected, painted the side of our building — and by 1 o’clock they’d all moved back,” said Mitch Blumenfeld, vice president of a South L.A. business that sells mannequins, shelving and other fixtures for stores.

“Then Wednesday, we had a fire. What’s going to happen when a building like this goes up in flames and they lose all the revenue?”

Complaints to 311 trigger a step-by-step process: City workers visit the location identified by the requester to check whenter it is really a homeless encampment or just some abandoned items, according to the Bureau of Sanitation. At hot spots like Shatto Place, the city checks on requests in batches on the same days that trash is collected.

If sanitation workers find a mattress or a couch, they can pick it up and reclassify the complaint as a “bulky item” request, according to the department. Hundreds of other complaints are closed on the day of the assessment without a cleanup.

But if homeless people are present, the Bureau of Sanitation needs to get additional approval for a cleanup, including a sign-off from the Homeless Services Authority after it has done outreach. That can take as long as three weeks, according to the city.

“If I could do it quicker, I would. But that outreach component has to be there,” said Jose “Pepe” Garcia, assistant general manager for sanitation.

He added that unlike abandoned couches, homeless camps cannot simply be carted away. L.A. has repeatedly been sued for violating the rights of homeless people, and last year, a federal appeals court ruled that homeless people cannot be punished for sleeping on public property if they have no access to shelter.

On a gray morning, Darryl Dolberry and other members of the authority’s Homeless Engagement Team stopped along a spartan stretch of Alameda Street and 41st Place in South L.A., checking whether anyone was home at a makeshift shelter of tarps and plywood alongside a drab industrial building.

The surge in cleanups has pulled workers such as Dolberry away from their regularly scheduled efforts to proactively reach out to homeless people in assigned neighborhoods, rerouting them to sites slotted for cleanups so they can try to help people before city crews arrive, said Heidi Marston, the achief program officer for the homeless authority.

Dolberry called out and knocked, but no one was there.

The makeshift shelter was the home of Rickey Harris, who later said he had lived on the street for years. Before becoming homeless, Harris said he used to remodel houses in the neighborhood. Now he scrapes by making money with recycling and doing odd jobs.

He had no interest in going to the shelter suggested by outreach workers, saying he might not even get a spot if he went.

Nearby, a flier posted on a telephone pole warned that a cleanup was coming in a few days. City workers are supposed to post a flier 24 to 72 hours in advance, telling homeless people they will have to remove their belongings.

Homeless people also can face “rapid response” teams, which enforce rules against keeping too much personal property on the sidewalks. And if they camp out on private property, they can be ejected without the same warning.

Critics argue that relying on 311 complaints can politicize the cleanup process. In one case publicized by Adrian Riskin, a blogger on MichaelKohlhaas.org, Garcetti aides asked police officials via email to make sure a South L.A. encampment was cleaned up before the mayor visited a construction site in the area.

“There's no attempt at having a plan, so they can use their resources to actually address the problem,” Riskin said. “It looks like it’s a political tactic.”

Garcetti spokesman Alex Comisar said the emails “do not reflect the mayor’s approach to interacting with Angelenos experiencing homelessness, and he was unaware of this exchange.”

Days after the flier went up on the street where Harris lived, nearly a score of city workers arrived at 41st Place to clear his shelter. They came with a trash truck, a flatbed loaded with supplies for a hazardous-waste team, and a front loader to remove trash piled high on the street — some of it likely dumped by local businesses. Police officers blocked the street with their squad cars.

This was all for one man’s ramshackle home.

“Until they find the adequate housing, I’m responsible for who and what is out here,” Garcia said as he watched his crew load broken pallets into a trash truck.

Harris bundled some clothes and other belongings into shopping carts and rolled them over to the next block, where he pulled out some cushions and shut his eyes against the morning cold.

“I couldn’t sleep last night, knowing they was coming,” he said after waking. Yet he was calm, even philosophical. “Ain’t nothing I can do about it. All that negativity pulls all the positive energy.”

A block away, four people in white protective suits and face masks cut back the tarps that covered his home, revealing the things he had left behind: a bed that was made, a pile of folded clothes, instant coffee, a container of Vick’s Vap-O-Rub, rubber sandals, mini flashlights and a Granny Smith apple.

When Harris returned later, it would all be gone, either tossed out or stored elsewhere.

As he chatted with reporters, a young couple greeted him. One neighbor paused in his truck, waiting for Harris to wave. If he doesn’t stop by a local truck for coffee or a breakfast sandwich, Harris said, people ask him, “What’s wrong?”

“I wouldn’t want to move out of this neighborhood,” he said.

Days later, he was back at the same spot where his shelter once stood, sleeping on a cushion flanked by shopping carts.","(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Homeless people set up tents outside the Villa Adobe apartment building in Koreatown.

212,Complaints about homeless camps in L.A. have surged. But are cleanups pointless?,Doug Smith,"Austin Yi said he couldn’t take it anymore. Noise from the tents along Shatto Place rose to his third-floor Koreatown apartment at night: yelling, screaming, the clanging of tools as people repaired bikes.

When he couldn’t drown out the racket with white noise, the 27-year-old and his wife would drag blankets into the hallway to sleep on the floor. Yi regularly lodged complaints through the city’s 311 system.

""At first I had so much sympathy,” he said, recounting the times he had handed over money or offered to buy food. “Now it changed me. … I wish they would just go away.”

Around the corner from Yi, Fernando Alvarado lamented the items he lost to city sweeps of homeless encampments: His shoes. His identification card. A blanket to ward off the night chill.

The latest sweep, Alvarado said, happened two weeks ago. But he and a few others quickly camped out again in front of a vacant lot on Westmoreland Avenue.

221,Complaints about homeless camps in L.A. have surged. But are cleanups pointless?,Emily Alpert Reyes,"Austin Yi said he couldn’t take it anymore. Noise from the tents along Shatto Place rose to his third-floor Koreatown apartment at night: yelling, screaming, the clanging of tools as people repaired bikes.

When he couldn’t drown out the racket with white noise, the 27-year-old and his wife would drag blankets into the hallway to sleep on the floor. Yi regularly lodged complaints through the city’s 311 system.

""At first I had so much sympathy,” he said, recounting the times he had handed over money or offered to buy food. “Now it changed me. … I wish they would just go away.”

Around the corner from Yi, Fernando Alvarado lamented the items he lost to city sweeps of homeless encampments: His shoes. His identification card. A blanket to ward off the night chill.

The latest sweep, Alvarado said, happened two weeks ago. But he and a few others quickly camped out again in front of a vacant lot on Westmoreland Avenue.

Los Angeles has been deluged with requests to clean up homeless encampments in recent years. Between 2016 and 2018, such requests shot up 167%, according to a Times analysis of 311 data. The trend has continued this year, with requests up 37% in the first few months compared to the same period a year earlier.

The surge in cleanup requests has happened as L.A. and other cities have seen hefty increases in the number of people without permanent shelter. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority announced Tuesday that the homeless population had jumped by 16% in the city and 12% across the county. Most — 75% — were living outdoors, including in vehicles.

City officials say they have relied on complaints to plan cleanups, in part, because there aren’t enough crews to regularly clean the entire city. Homeless activists have denounced that method as arbitrary and are calling for an overhaul of a system they decry as dehumanizing and wasteful.

As complaints have surged, L.A. politicians have faced competing pressures from activists, business owners and residents, spurring fresh soul-searching at City Hall about the sweeps. City Councilman Mike Bonin , whose coastal district includes the homeless hot spot of Venice, recently declared that “it is nearly impossible to find anyone who is satisfied with the result.”

The Times identified more than 100 locations where calls and other 311 service requests became so persistent that the city was responding to complaints weekly for at least five weeks in a row. Such cycles have occurred from the West San Fernando Valley to Venice but were most common downtown, in Hollywood and Koreatown.

One such place is the short stretch of Shatto Place where Yi used to live, around the corner from where Alvarado beds down. The city fielded 172 requests there in just a year and a half.

At the apartment complex that Yi left, property manager Samantha Son has urged tenants to lodge complaints with the city and tracked requests with a spreadsheet. Son worries that the encampments alongside the building are driving away prospective tenants — even though the number of tents has declined in recent months.

“Whenever the people come to visit, they like the unit inside,” said Son, who lives on the second floor. “But then they see the outside and don't come back.”

Across the street, Rev. Gonggun Hwang has heard his congregants complain that they feel unsafe walking to and from the Won Buddhism of Los Angeles temple. One homeless man routinely slept outside the temple’s doors, and Hwang said he has had to repeatedly clean up urine and feces.

“As a Buddhist, I didn’t really want to bother them,” Hwang said. “But I couldn’t help but do something.”

For a while, he turned to 311 to complain. The tents dwindled at times, but didn’t disappear.

Now “I understand they got nowhere to go,” Hwang said. “So I gave up.”

Homeless encampments are only a small fraction of the 311 requests fielded by the city, which are topped by demands to pick up bulky items and clean up graffiti.

But it is the fastest-growing category and presents the city with an expensive and bedeviling challenge. The city budgeted more than $30 million this fiscal year for homeless encampment cleanups and is planning to spend nearly $40 million in the coming year, according to city officials.

A coalition of activists called Services Not Sweeps has launched a campaign to push Mayor Eric Garcetti to scrap the city’s existing system, saying that cleanups shouldn’t be triggered by complaints but be regularly scheduled so homeless people can prepare. They want bins and trash bags provided to people so they can throw out trash before city crews arrive. And they don’t want police on the cleanup teams, as officers are now.

“We can have a system that treats homeless people like something to be cleaned up … or one that deals with the reality that we’re facing,” said Mike Dickerson, an organizer with Ktown for All, a grassroots group that assists and advocates for homeless people in Koreatown and is part of the Services Not Sweeps coalition.

Even some of the people who dial 311 — like Hwang at his temple — are uneasy about the process. Many homeowners and business owners, in turn, are frustrated that the cleanups seem to do little, complaining that tents and trash come back after each sweep.

“Last Tuesday they cleared out, disinfected, painted the side of our building — and by 1 o’clock they’d all moved back,” said Mitch Blumenfeld, vice president of a South L.A. business that sells mannequins, shelving and other fixtures for stores.

“Then Wednesday, we had a fire. What’s going to happen when a building like this goes up in flames and they lose all the revenue?”

Complaints to 311 trigger a step-by-step process: City workers visit the location identified by the requester to check whenter it is really a homeless encampment or just some abandoned items, according to the Bureau of Sanitation. At hot spots like Shatto Place, the city checks on requests in batches on the same days that trash is collected.

If sanitation workers find a mattress or a couch, they can pick it up and reclassify the complaint as a “bulky item” request, according to the department. Hundreds of other complaints are closed on the day of the assessment without a cleanup.

But if homeless people are present, the Bureau of Sanitation needs to get additional approval for a cleanup, including a sign-off from the Homeless Services Authority after it has done outreach. That can take as long as three weeks, according to the city.

“If I could do it quicker, I would. But that outreach component has to be there,” said Jose “Pepe” Garcia, assistant general manager for sanitation.

He added that unlike abandoned couches, homeless camps cannot simply be carted away. L.A. has repeatedly been sued for violating the rights of homeless people, and last year, a federal appeals court ruled that homeless people cannot be punished for sleeping on public property if they have no access to shelter.

On a gray morning, Darryl Dolberry and other members of the authority’s Homeless Engagement Team stopped along a spartan stretch of Alameda Street and 41st Place in South L.A., checking whether anyone was home at a makeshift shelter of tarps and plywood alongside a drab industrial building.

The surge in cleanups has pulled workers such as Dolberry away from their regularly scheduled efforts to proactively reach out to homeless people in assigned neighborhoods, rerouting them to sites slotted for cleanups so they can try to help people before city crews arrive, said Heidi Marston, the achief program officer for the homeless authority.

Dolberry called out and knocked, but no one was there.

The makeshift shelter was the home of Rickey Harris, who later said he had lived on the street for years. Before becoming homeless, Harris said he used to remodel houses in the neighborhood. Now he scrapes by making money with recycling and doing odd jobs.

He had no interest in going to the shelter suggested by outreach workers, saying he might not even get a spot if he went.

Nearby, a flier posted on a telephone pole warned that a cleanup was coming in a few days. City workers are supposed to post a flier 24 to 72 hours in advance, telling homeless people they will have to remove their belongings.

Homeless people also can face “rapid response” teams, which enforce rules against keeping too much personal property on the sidewalks. And if they camp out on private property, they can be ejected without the same warning.

Critics argue that relying on 311 complaints can politicize the cleanup process. In one case publicized by Adrian Riskin, a blogger on MichaelKohlhaas.org, Garcetti aides asked police officials via email to make sure a South L.A. encampment was cleaned up before the mayor visited a construction site in the area.

“There's no attempt at having a plan, so they can use their resources to actually address the problem,” Riskin said. “It looks like it’s a political tactic.”

Garcetti spokesman Alex Comisar said the emails “do not reflect the mayor’s approach to interacting with Angelenos experiencing homelessness, and he was unaware of this exchange.”

Days after the flier went up on the street where Harris lived, nearly a score of city workers arrived at 41st Place to clear his shelter. They came with a trash truck, a flatbed loaded with supplies for a hazardous-waste team, and a front loader to remove trash piled high on the street — some of it likely dumped by local businesses. Police officers blocked the street with their squad cars.

This was all for one man’s ramshackle home.

“Until they find the adequate housing, I’m responsible for who and what is out here,” Garcia said as he watched his crew load broken pallets into a trash truck.

Harris bundled some clothes and other belongings into shopping carts and rolled them over to the next block, where he pulled out some cushions and shut his eyes against the morning cold.

“I couldn’t sleep last night, knowing they was coming,” he said after waking. Yet he was calm, even philosophical. “Ain’t nothing I can do about it. All that negativity pulls all the positive energy.”

A block away, four people in white protective suits and face masks cut back the tarps that covered his home, revealing the things he had left behind: a bed that was made, a pile of folded clothes, instant coffee, a container of Vick’s Vap-O-Rub, rubber sandals, mini flashlights and a Granny Smith apple.

When Harris returned later, it would all be gone, either tossed out or stored elsewhere.

As he chatted with reporters, a young couple greeted him. One neighbor paused in his truck, waiting for Harris to wave. If he doesn’t stop by a local truck for coffee or a breakfast sandwich, Harris said, people ask him, “What’s wrong?”

“I wouldn’t want to move out of this neighborhood,” he said.

Days later, he was back at the same spot where his shelter once stood, sleeping on a cushion flanked by shopping carts.","(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Homeless people set up tents outside the Villa Adobe apartment building in Koreatown.

For a while, he turned to 311 to complain. The tents dwindled at times, but didn’t disappear.

Now “I understand they got nowhere to go,” Hwang said. “So I gave up.”

Homeless encampments are only a small fraction of the 311 requests fielded by the city, which are topped by demands to pick up bulky items and clean up graffiti.

But it is the fastest-growing category and presents the city with an expensive and bedeviling challenge. The city budgeted more than $30 million this fiscal year for homeless encampment cleanups and is planning to spend nearly $40 million in the coming year, according to city officials.

A coalition of activists called Services Not Sweeps has launched a campaign to push Mayor Eric Garcetti to scrap the city’s existing system, saying that cleanups shouldn’t be triggered by complaints but be regularly scheduled so homeless people can prepare. They want bins and trash bags provided to people so they can throw out trash before city crews arrive. And they don’t want police on the cleanup teams, as officers are now.

“We can have a system that treats homeless people like something to be cleaned up … or one that deals with the reality that we’re facing,” said Mike Dickerson, an organizer with Ktown for All, a grassroots group that assists and advocates for homeless people in Koreatown and is part of the Services Not Sweeps coalition.

Even some of the people who dial 311 — like Hwang at his temple — are uneasy about the process. Many homeowners and business owners, in turn, are frustrated that the cleanups seem to do little, complaining that tents and trash come back after each sweep.

“Last Tuesday they cleared out, disinfected, painted the side of our building — and by 1 o’clock they’d all moved back,” said Mitch Blumenfeld, vice president of a South L.A. business that sells mannequins, shelving and other fixtures for stores.

“Then Wednesday, we had a fire. What’s going to happen when a building like this goes up in flames and they lose all the revenue?”

Complaints to 311 trigger a step-by-step process: City workers visit the location identified by the requester to check whenter it is really a homeless encampment or just some abandoned items, according to the Bureau of Sanitation. At hot spots like Shatto Place, the city checks on requests in batches on the same days that trash is collected.

If sanitation workers find a mattress or a couch, they can pick it up and reclassify the complaint as a “bulky item” request, according to the department. Hundreds of other complaints are closed on the day of the assessment without a cleanup.

But if homeless people are present, the Bureau of Sanitation needs to get additional approval for a cleanup, including a sign-off from the Homeless Services Authority after it has done outreach. That can take as long as three weeks, according to the city.

“If I could do it quicker, I would. But that outreach component has to be there,” said Jose “Pepe” Garcia, assistant general manager for sanitation.

He added that unlike abandoned couches, homeless camps cannot simply be carted away. L.A. has repeatedly been sued for violating the rights of homeless people, and last year, a federal appeals court ruled that homeless people cannot be punished for sleeping on public property if they have no access to shelter.

On a gray morning, Darryl Dolberry and other members of the authority’s Homeless Engagement Team stopped along a spartan stretch of Alameda Street and 41st Place in South L.A., checking whether anyone was home at a makeshift shelter of tarps and plywood alongside a drab industrial building.

The surge in cleanups has pulled workers such as Dolberry away from their regularly scheduled efforts to proactively reach out to homeless people in assigned neighborhoods, rerouting them to sites slotted for cleanups so they can try to help people before city crews arrive, said Heidi Marston, the achief program officer for the homeless authority.

Dolberry called out and knocked, but no one was there.

The makeshift shelter was the home of Rickey Harris, who later said he had lived on the street for years. Before becoming homeless, Harris said he used to remodel houses in the neighborhood. Now he scrapes by making money with recycling and doing odd jobs.

He had no interest in going to the shelter suggested by outreach workers, saying he might not even get a spot if he went.

Nearby, a flier posted on a telephone pole warned that a cleanup was coming in a few days. City workers are supposed to post a flier 24 to 72 hours in advance, telling homeless people they will have to remove their belongings.

Homeless people also can face “rapid response” teams, which enforce rules against keeping too much personal property on the sidewalks. And if they camp out on private property, they can be ejected without the same warning.

Critics argue that relying on 311 complaints can politicize the cleanup process. In one case publicized by Adrian Riskin, a blogger on MichaelKohlhaas.org, Garcetti aides asked police officials via email to make sure a South L.A. encampment was cleaned up before the mayor visited a construction site in the area.

“There's no attempt at having a plan, so they can use their resources to actually address the problem,” Riskin said. “It looks like it’s a political tactic.”

Garcetti spokesman Alex Comisar said the emails “do not reflect the mayor’s approach to interacting with Angelenos experiencing homelessness, and he was unaware of this exchange.”

Days after the flier went up on the street where Harris lived, nearly a score of city workers arrived at 41st Place to clear his shelter. They came with a trash truck, a flatbed loaded with supplies for a hazardous-waste team, and a front loader to remove trash piled high on the street — some of it likely dumped by local businesses. Police officers blocked the street with their squad cars.

This was all for one man’s ramshackle home.

“Until they find the adequate housing, I’m responsible for who and what is out here,” Garcia said as he watched his crew load broken pallets into a trash truck.

Harris bundled some clothes and other belongings into shopping carts and rolled them over to the next block, where he pulled out some cushions and shut his eyes against the morning cold.

“I couldn’t sleep last night, knowing they was coming,” he said after waking. Yet he was calm, even philosophical. “Ain’t nothing I can do about it. All that negativity pulls all the positive energy.”

A block away, four people in white protective suits and face masks cut back the tarps that covered his home, revealing the things he had left behind: a bed that was made, a pile of folded clothes, instant coffee, a container of Vick’s Vap-O-Rub, rubber sandals, mini flashlights and a Granny Smith apple.

When Harris returned later, it would all be gone, either tossed out or stored elsewhere.

As he chatted with reporters, a young couple greeted him. One neighbor paused in his truck, waiting for Harris to wave. If he doesn’t stop by a local truck for coffee or a breakfast sandwich, Harris said, people ask him, “What’s wrong?”

“I wouldn’t want to move out of this neighborhood,” he said.

Days later, he was back at the same spot where his shelter once stood, sleeping on a cushion flanked by shopping carts.","(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Homeless people set up tents outside the Villa Adobe apartment building in Koreatown.

262,"Bob Hope house in Palm Springs, long an architectural footnote, approaches masterpiece status",Tina Daunt,"For decades, this city has been known for its high-low mix of desert culture, exemplified by the offerings on East Palm Canyon Drive, a well-traveled road with views of the craggy brown hills to the south.

Discreet signs alert drivers to country clubs and golf resorts that are just a few blocks away from a string of consignment stores, luxury car dealerships, supermarkets — and a 1950s trailer park with streets named after planets and stars — Venus, Mars, Rigel, Vega.

Just past the turnoff for the Horizon Mobile Village and RV Park, there’s no evidence of a multimillion-dollar project that will attract worldwide attention upon its completion. But up the hill and past the guard station on Southridge Drive, Palm Springs’ most exclusive hillside neighborhood has been rumbling with the sound of power tools and construction trucks for well over a year, as more than a hundred craftsmen from across the Coachella Valley have worked to bring the city’s most famous house back to life.

Starchitecture groupies may refer to it as a John Lautner house, in reference to the celebrated Los Angeles architect who designed it, but locally it’s known to many as the Bob Hope house, a circular 24,000-square-foot residence built 40-plus years ago for the entertainer and his family.

Many observers have said the structure, with its sweeping, gravity-defying roof and 60-foot-wide oculus, looks like a spaceship parked on a rugged hill — and when Hope first saw Lautner’s architectural model, he quipped: “Well, at least when they come down from Mars they’ll know where to go.”

If only the actual task of building the house was filled with that much levity.

Lautner envisioned a residence that blended in with the surrounding rocky landscape. The interior design would be defined by the extraordinary play of desert light throughout the home — and the breathtaking views of the desert and the mountains.

They were Hollywood royalty and wanted a home to reflect that status. Eventually, they hired a Beverly Hills society decorator (who worked for the shah of Iran’s sister) to do the interiors. When the house was completed in 1980, Lautner walked away dismayed. The desert residence was considered as a footnote, rather than a highlight, in a distinguished career.

Until now. Thanks to the deep pockets of venture capitalist Ron Burkle, the house is being remade to reflect the architect’s original vision. Lautner protégé Helena Arahuete, who worked with him for 23 years, has stripped the interiors and rebuilt the inside with natural materials. Swan faucets, wallpaper and carpet are out. Quartzite flooring, African mahogany and Brazilian granite are in — as is the shape-shifting light that transforms the house during the course of the day.

With the project now in its final stages, the house is almost ready for its relaunch.

With her bright blue eyes and gray hair, Arahuete is known, affectionately, as “La Señora” at the work site. On a recent evening, as the sun set behind the San Jacinto Mountains, she recalled the genesis of the Hope estate and assessed the progress of the renovation.

The Hopes hired Lautner in 1969, in part because they admired the circular house he had built for Palm Springs’ star interior designer Arthur Elrod, just down the street on Southridge Drive. But in 1973, just as construction was getting underway, a spark from a welder's torch set the roof’s wood sheathing on fire. The entire structure burned down in 15 minutes, and the project was stalled for five years while the Hopes fought a court battle with the contractor.

‘Well, at least when they come down from Mars they’ll know where to go.’

During that time, Elrod — a master of midcentury design who was set to do the interiors of the Hope house with Lautner — was killed along with an associate in a car accident in Palm Springs.

“He was a very good designer,” Arahuete said. “Had he not died, the house would have been totally different, I'm sure.”

Dolores Hope wanted an ultra-glamorous interior suitable for Hollywood-style entertaining and golf tournament after-parties. Without Elrod there to mediate, “she wanted everything very ornamented, very rich — you know, gold and pink and black and mirrors everywhere,” Arahuete said.

Deeply influenced by her friends Walter and Leonore Annenberg — who owned the pink-roofed Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage — Dolores requested that the mushroom-shaped roof on her house be covered in terracotta pink gunite instead of the brown metal that Lautner envisioned.

Lautner complied with the request. But he and Arahuete, who was the site architect on the Hope project at the time, were deeply disappointed. Lautner rarely complained about clients, but he later told a documentarian that the Hope project “was an ugly, tough job.”

Lautner had spent his career creating striking domestic architecture across the world, including the UFO-shaped Chemosphere house in the Hollywood Hills off Mulholland Drive. But for years after its completion, the 10-bedroom Hope house was barely mentioned in admiring appraisals of the architect, who had developed his signature “organic modernism” as one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s star students. When the Hope house was mentioned at all by scholars or critics, it was usually with a sigh of perplexed disappointment.

With Arahuete leading the renovation, alongside project manager and longtime art and design consultant Tim Gleason, Burkle's team believes the house, when completed, will finally be counted among Lautner’s most stunning architectural masterpieces.

Ron Burkle grew up on the other side of the San Gorgonio Pass, in the Pomona Valley, and he remembers seeing the Hope house as a young man while working as the manager of a nearby Stater Bros. grocery store. (Burkle made his first fortune in the supermarket business.) He was astonished to see a home that was larger than his place of work.

Burkle already had an interest in architecture, an enthusiasm that started when he was a teenager, looking for a world beyond the confines of his life in a working-class community. He started to read books about famous architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, and was captivated by photos of Wright’s Ennis house, the largest of the so-called textile block houses that the master built in Los Angeles.

At the age of 15, Burkle talked his father into driving him to see the Ennis house in Los Feliz for himself, and he slipped a note into the mailbox asking if he could come back to see the home’s interior. He was surprised when the owner responded with an invitation for a tour, and his dad took him back to the house on his day off.

Burkle’s passion for architectural masterpieces continued as his business empire grew and he acquired a number of important residences on two continents. He owned the Elrod house on Southridge for a while, and eventually purchased the Ennis house — for just under $4.5 million in 2011. Burkle and his team spent $13 million restoring the residence, with longtime aide Frank Quintero overseeing the last three years of the six-year renovation. Eventually, Burkle appointed Gleason as curator of the Ennis estate.

After Dolores Hope died in 2011, at age 102, the Hope house went on the market for $50 million. Eventually, the price was dropped to $24,999,000 (a one-percenter’s notion, perhaps, of a half-price sale). With the Ennis restoration nearly finished, Gleason encouraged Burkle to meet with Arahuete — who had a strong following among Lautner fans — to discuss what it would take to restore the estate on Southridge Drive.

“When I met with Helena for the first time,” Burkle said, “I had a great feeling about the potential for the house. Helena’s office walls were filled with pictures of many of my favorite houses. Helena had a part in designing all of them with Lautner.”

Burkle quickly scrapped his plans to build a desert retreat at the ultra-exclusive Madison Club in La Quinta — where the Kardashian family has bought property — and in November 2016 put in an offer on the Hope house instead. His purchase price: $13 million.

Arahuete started her career with Lautner in 1971 after immigrating to the U.S. from Argentina. After her mentor died in 1994, she went out on her own, designing homes from Alaska to Australia in the “organic modernism” style. She avoided going to Palm Springs “for many years.” But in 2013, two years after their mother’s death, the Hope children asked Arahuete if she would come to the desert for a consultation before they put their parents’ estate on the market.

As she drove into the city and looked at the Southridge Drive property, Arahuete was surprised to see that the roof had been changed again — it was covered in copper, glinting from the hills like a second sun. Within a year, the copper acquired a brown patina, and the house finally seemed to blend a bit with its surroundings.

Maybe there was hope for the house after all?

After Burkle purchased the property in 2016, he scheduled half a dozen meetings with Arahuete, at Gleason’s suggestion. After Burkle gave them the green light, Arahuete and Gleason went to work. They mined the Lautner archive at the Getty, where they unearthed all of his papers on the Hope house, including one of Elrod’s renderings for the home’s entertainment areas. They tore out the Hopes’ 1995 addition, and they reimagined the interiors, removing all decorative elements that did not fit with Lautner’s original vision. (The Hopes' swan-shaped Sherle Wagner bathroom fixtures were repurposed at the Hope estate in Toluca Lake, which Burkle bought for $15 million in June 2018.)

Gleason went to work designing and buying furniture, inspired by Elrod’s style, while Arahuete replaced the flooring with an iridescent patchwork pattern of gray quartzite, which catches the sunlight during the day and the glow of the house lights at night.

Following Lautner’s practice of using mahogany to add warmth to his modernist structures, Arahuete strategically paneled many of the walls with the reddish-brown wood. The wood also provided the “lighting troughs” for thousands of yards of LED tubing concealed inside the house. (The lighting technology, which Lautner could never have imaged 40 years ago, was also woven into the quartzite surfaces throughout the interior and exterior of the estate.) With the warm reflective colors in the mahogany and the iridescent mica in the quartzite floor, the Hope house now glows like a lantern at twilight.

Intrusive landscaping, put in place by the Hopes as a privacy measure, was removed — opening the views of the San Jacinto Mountains and Palm Springs’ famous windmills.

It’s not easy renovating a giant round house with thousands of curves and few squares, but Burkle said, “I want the Hope house to continue to be something the Coachella Valley community is proud of.”

He also wants people to know that he has no patience with anyone who disrespects the Hopes — or the way they decorated their Palm Springs house.

They could have abandoned the project. They could have hired a more conservative architect. They didn’t.

“They were leaders in philanthropy and in the support of our troops all over the world,” Burkle said. They were a huge part of the Palm Springs community and its history.”

The Hopes envisioned the house as a space for entertaining and bringing people together, Burkle said, adding, “I expect to use the house in a similar way.”

During a recent reception at the Soho house in West Hollywood (another one of Burkle’s properties), the billionaire was asked how many homes he owns. He smiled and shrugged.

His official residence is in Montana these days, but he has a place in New York, a beach house in La Jolla and a townhouse in London. He also owns the Greenacres estate in Beverly Hills, where he has hosted scores of events over the years, always with a long list of notables in attendance.

Burkle believes in opening up his homes to groups he supports for charity fundraisers, political gatherings and receptions, and when the current renovation is complete, the Palm Springs house — which includes a music room, game room and a home theater with a rare Samsung screen — will be ready to play the same role.

The renovation of the Hope estate was supposed to be done in time for the first Coachella weekend in April (Burkle has been attending the annual music festival for years.) But a rainy winter wreaked havoc with the timetable and made Arahuete's commute from the Westside to the resort town an exercise in navigating gridlock.

Despite the delays, Lautner’s vision is already apparent.

“Architecture is art,” said Arahuete. “You see a painting or a mural in two dimensions on a wall. A sculpture — you can walk around and see it from different angles.

“But good architecture is almost like you're inside of the sculpture and the art is around you, and the way you frame the views — if you're lucky enough to be able to design in an area that has beautiful views — then the views become like the permanent work of art that's constantly changing with the seasons and the light of the day.”","When the Hope house was mentioned at all by scholars or critics, it was usually with a sigh of perplexed disappointment.

All year, family and friends sent the recent graduate photos, texts and videos from the Vons — treating it the way tourists from the mainland might sunbathing at the Descanso Beach Club or staring at the island’s famous buffaloes.

Located on the edge of downtown Avalon, Catalina’s only city, the Vons — not exactly a trendy and hip staple of Southern California’s grocer ecosystem — has become an unlikely phenomenon.

With stunning views and sparkling waters, “The Island of Romance” is not a government-designated “food desert,” a term for neglected, poor neighborhoods where affordable and fresh food is hard to find. But for decades, many of the island’s roughly 4,000 residents had to travel “over town” — Avalon-speak for the mainland — to buy many of their needs.

“People tell me how they just wander the aisles, like, stunned at how much there is. It’s a really, really, really big deal,” Alvarez said of the new Vons. “It wasn’t until I moved to New York that I realized the magnitude of options ‘over town’… Now, it’s going to be insane.”

Catalina’s charm has long distracted outsiders from the fact most restaurants are geared toward luring tourists. An a la carte lunchtime lobster taco at Maggie's Blue Rose, just steps away from the pier, is $11.50. Land to grow crops is nonexistent, since most of undeveloped Catalina is either overseen by the nonprofit Catalina Island Conservancy or owned by the Catalina Island Company.

The Catalina Vons’ grand opening in January was by far the most-attended debut in the chain’s 113-year history. Hundreds of people saw a ribbon-cutting ceremony, speeches by politicians and a song performed by preschoolers that thanked “the food” they were about to try and “the friends we have today.” Once the doors opened, adults cried or high-fived each other; children ran through the the aisles with such joy that teachers asked their students the following day at school to tone it down next time.

“People tell me how they just wander the aisles, like, stunned at how much there is. It’s a really, really, really big deal.” Blanca Alvarez, Avalon resident

Vons has essentially functioned as Avalon’s nutritional lifeline since 1942 in the form of two stores — now closed —that were much smaller than the new 23,000-square-foot market.

“You didn’t shop at old Vons,” said Julie Perlins Lee, executive director of the Catalina Island Museum, who has lived on the island for two years. “You made a game plan for getting in, grabbed what you needed and got out as fast as possible. There were hours you just avoided it altogether.”

“The aisles were so small that you couldn’t fit a twin stroller in one,” said Rick McFadden, the assistant manager at the new Vons. “There was even a certain way around the store that people walked. If you were going upstream, we knew you weren’t from here.”

Avalonians had to regularly visit the mainland and return with suitcases and boxes filled with groceries that they couldn’t get on the island or that were overpriced. Every three months, Alvarez accompanied her mother to the Costco in Signal Hill to “buy tons and tons of things.”

“By the time produce would be at [the old Vons], it would already be bad,” she said. “Strawberries already had mold on it. A lot of the mangoes were dark green or not edible. It was just two days that you could eat them, and they’d get completely bad.”

The parking lot of the new supermarket has only one regular-sized space; the rest are striped to accommodate golf carts, the island’s preferred mode of transportation. The exterior was built to reflect the bucolic aesthetics of Avalon; the front is designed in the Craftsman style and a side wall features freshly planted bougainvillea.

And, in a reflection of the city’s Latino-majority population, the in-store bakery makes its own Mexican pastries — pastel de tres leches is the store’s top-selling cake.

“Would we put that in Manhattan Beach? Probably not,” said Bob Erickson, a district manager for Albertson’s, Von’s corporate parent. (German chocolate cake is the top seller in that coastal community). “But this was lacking here.”

His enthusiasm belies the challenge Vons endured to build their still smaller-than-average Avalon outpost. Most supermarkets don’t face 25-year roadblocks like government audits, California’s recent epic drought, town halls, the Great Recession and even the state Attorney General.

“This one cost the same as two regular ones, even though it’s smaller,” Erickson said. “But this one is worth it.”

Other independent mom-and-pop grocers operated in Avalon until the last one closed in 1998. Vons took over the spot, a former YMCA basketball gym, to complement its original island location.

The two other Vons combined totaled just about 14,000 square feet, 9,000 square feet smaller than the new one. That is still much smaller than the average Vons, which is about 43,000 square feet.

Executives began to plan for a new, larger Avalon store shortly after Erickson became district manager in 1994. He remembers seeing artist’s renderings back then — along with an 18-month construction plan.

“Well, every time we were getting something ready to go,” he said with a laugh, “we had to take a time-out.”

“There was even a certain way around the store that people walked. If you were going upstream, we knew you weren’t from here.” Rick McFadden – assistant manager at Vons

The scarcity of land on Catalina for development stymied their efforts for years. Then in 2005, the California attorney general’s office accused Vons of violating federal antitrust laws, alleging the chain held a monopoly over the island.

The company admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to reimburse the attorney general $25,000 for their “investigatory costs” and give $60,000 to the city “to be used for the benefit of consumers who purchased Grocery Store products in Avalon,” according to a judgment. Vons also submitted to a consent decree in which they agreed to give up the newer branch to any competitor that wanted it.

No one bit.

The two-Vons setup continued through the Great Recession, until Albertson’s finally submitted plans for a new project in 2014, buying property that once housed a nursery. Critics fought the proposal, contending that such a large building would ruin Avalon’s feel. Residents flooded city council meetings in protest.

Councilmember Richard Hernandez and three other island residents sent letters to the California Public Utilities Commission asking them to audit the store’s proposal to get water from Catalina’s heavily rationed reserves (Hernandez did not return a request for comment). An anti-Vons slogan referring to the street where the Vons now stands was coined: “No Bacon on Beacon.”

Other Avalonians pushed back. One was John King, who moved to Catalina in 2001 and whose wife has celiac disease. The couple had to regularly ship in food, which became increasingly expensive.

“We’d need gluten-free bread,” he said, “and you’d turn around and say, ‘Darn, it’s not around.’”

The former marketing executive printed red T-shirts with the slogan “I Want My Bacon on Beacon” and saw more than 500 people wear them to a City Council meeting.

“Old-time island people have something of a notion that things should never change,” King said. “It’s nostalgic to them. But when you live here day to day, it’s not fun at all.”

The larger store was finally approved by the City Council in 2017, with Hernandez casting the lone “no” vote. Construction was finished within a year this past December.

Mayor Ann Marshall declared it a victory for Avalon.

“I know more people will shop locally,” she said. “That brings more revenue to the city.”

On a recent Friday, the Vons hummed with shoppers. Families pushed carts loaded with produce and frozen pizzas; blue-collar workers in neon-colored sweatshirts and stained jeans ladled Italian wedding soup into 32-ounce deli cups. A couple looked through bouquets of roses and baby’s breath in a corner devoted to flowers; at the old locations, the only floral arrangements available were on two rolling racks.

Still, not everyone is impressed. Cookie Sampson, 84, has lived her entire life on the island and thinks the store is beautiful. But she thinks it’s better suited to the mainland. For “over town.” She’s not crazy about the prices, either. A dollar hike in Oroweat rye bread makes it difficult for people like her who live on fixed incomes, she complained.

“But it’s like that everywhere,” Sampson said. “If you want to be here, you just go with the flow and accept it.”","Land to grow crops is nonexistent, since most of undeveloped Catalina is either overseen by the nonprofit Catalina Island Conservancy or owned by the Catalina Island Company.

271,"At this L.A. supper club, refugees share food and memories of the lives they left behind",Sarah Parvini,"Beneath the dimmed lights of a downtown L.A. restaurant, Naseema Kashefi watched quietly as a hungry crowd fawned over the crunch of her golden samosas. Servers passed her Afghan specialty on ceramic trays while her newfound fans groaned with each bite.

The meals of her childhood served as a reminder that Kashefi’s war-torn homeland is no longer safe, no longer a place where her family can stake out a future.

Now, the dish that her mother taught her to make a decade ago, in the humble confines of their Kabul kitchen, was uniting a group of strangers — lawyers, social workers, artists.

Over the next three hours, as bottles of wine drained and plates cleared, they would hear the story of how a family who once felt abandoned by the immigration system was embracing their new life in their adopted country.

“The help we have received has not been forgotten,” Kashefi had said earlier. “Now, in the same way that Americans have helped us, I can be of service to them through our traditions.”

It was a recent Sunday at the New Arrivals Supper Club, a communal feast prepared by immigrants from some of the world’s most troubled countries. Launched in 2017 by the L.A.-based nonprofit Miry’s List, the monthly dinners — hosted in homes and restaurants — aim to empower newly settled refugees by giving them opportunities to earn money, forge new communities and share their culture through food.

Since resettling in the U.S. from Syria, Abeer Aljrafi has participated in monthly dinners hosted by the L.A.-based nonprofit Miry’s List.

What started as informal gatherings in people’s backyards has morphed into large-scale events like this series at Spread Mediterranean Kitchen, which paired Kashefi’s appetizers with Middle Eastern food cooked by celebrity chef Simon Majumdar. Attendees purchase tickets for $50 each, or $75 with a wine pairing, which covers the costs of the chef’s wages and the equipment and provisions needed for the meal.

Proceeds from the dinners go to the family as well as to Miry’s List, which was founded in 2016 by community activist Miry Whitehill. On average each family receives between 60% and 65% of the full ticket price. In two years, Miry’s List has paid out more than $85,000 in wages.

Throughout Southern California, food often serves as an entree into other cultures and identities. For refugee cooks such as Kashefi, these meals provide the chance to share the breadcrumbs of their history.

“We want to show the culinary culture of Afghanistan,” she said in Dari. “We want to share this with the American people.”

Kashefi, who also speaks halting English, leans on her husband, Bashir Kashefi, a former interpreter who aided the U.S. military, to do most of the talking.

His military career was marked by long stretches away from his family, punctuated by interludes of terror. During one mission locating IEDs in Helmand, his convoy was pinned down by gunfire. He would have died, he said, if not for helicopter reinforcements.

“It’s a dangerous job,” the 36-year-old said, “but I chose it to save other people’s lives.”

He knew he needed to get his family out of Afghanistan in 2014, around the time several of his fellow interpreters had gone missing. No one knew whether they had been killed or abducted by the Taliban.

In 2016, he applied for a special immigrant visa, a program available to people who worked with the U.S. armed forces as translators or interpreters in Afghanistan. The State Department issued more than 4,000 such visas to Afghan applicants in fiscal year 2017, but the program saw a 60% decrease in fiscal year 2018, according to Congress.

Interpreters also found themselves caught under the first iteration of the Trump administration’s travel ban in 2017. Some were detained upon arrival or had their visas revoked. Multiple recipients were denied boarding for their flights to the United States, the International Refugee Assistance Project said.

Despite those complications, Bashir Kashefi landed in Los Angeles with his pregnant wife and their daughter in March 2017. Their first weeks in America weren’t what they’d imagined. This time two years ago, the Kashefi family had never felt more alone.

“Before, we didn't know anyone. We had no friends here,” Bashir Kashefi told the dozens of people gathered around him at Spread.

His audience leaned in from their metal chairs, listening and slathering samosas with the fiery chutney his wife had concocted.

“Now,” Bashir Kashefi said, “everyone here is our friend.”

Inside her Anaheim apartment on a weekday afternoon, Kashefi’s hands pressed through soft dough, her fingers dusted in smatterings of flour. She kneaded the pale discs, stretched them like mini-pizzas and sliced them in half on her kitchen counter.

Reaching for the blend of curried potatoes, green onion and coriander resting in a metal bowl, the 26-year-old explained that her Afghan samosas are a staple at special occasions. She often makes them as a treat for guests. Her mother taught her how to make them when she was 16.

“My mom is a great house cook,” she said, swaddling a clump of dough and mixture like a newborn before sealing it.

Surrounded by the ingredients of her mother’s recipe, Kashefi couldn’t help but think of her life in Afghanistan and her parents, four brothers and two sisters — all left behind.

“Degh kardam,” she said, wiping away tears — I died of grief.

She has two children of her own now, a 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son who was born here, she said, and it’s better for them to grow up in California.

But cooking transports her to her mother’s side, Kashefi said, and she plans on passing her mother’s recipes down to her daughter, Horia.

For many diners, the draw of the supper club goes beyond what a cook puts on a plate. For some, themselves immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Kashefis’ story rang familiar.

Ken Chiu and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Pan, arrived with two friends to hear about what it means to be a refugee and how to help a new family. The pair, who live in Los Angeles, learned of the dinner through Miry’s List email blasts.

A dinner “makes giving so easy. You immediately know it goes directly to them,” Pan, 44, said as she tucked into a bowl of spicy red lentil dal.

“People who voluntarily immigrate can plan,” Chiu, 44, interjected. “But people like them relocate by circumstance.”

Whitehill buzzed through the crowd, dressed in an Afghan tunic, greeting diners and dancing with the Kashefis’ children.

“People come to our events with almost a paralyzing concept of what a refugee or immigration is,” she said. “Meeting and learning about a family, it transforms that paralysis to, ‘I can actually do something about this.’ For us, it’s the way we open the door.”

Whitehill started Miry’s List in 2016, after she helped a refugee family from Syria sponsored by a friend’s church.

“Visiting them in their home, seeing what their apartment looked like, I recognized that they had needs for supplies, for things to start their first home,” she said. The first Miry’s List — a wish list filled with basics such as formula, diapers, eggs and milk — was born.

The organization has evolved since then, adding new-arrival dinners and events such as a multicultural Passover Seder. To Whitehill, Miry’s List is an extension of the values she was raised with in a close-knit Orthodox Jewish community that prized community service.

“In Hebrew, we call the concept chesed,” she said. “Kindness.”

The organization has helped more than 1,400 refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen and Kurdistan at a time when the Trump administration’s travel restrictions have brought refugee admissions to historic lows.

California has taken in 126 refugees from Afghanistan since October 2018, in addition to the 1,612 Afghans who arrived in the state on special immigrant visas, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. But advocates say new vetting rules put in place make it nearly impossible for people from certain countries to move to the U.S.

Whitehill aids refugees by providing transportation, helping to find lodging and checking in to see whether they need essentials for their home.

The agencies “take care of the basics that keep them alive, but not the things that make them feel alive,” she said. “That’s what we focus on.”

When the Kashefis arrived in Orange County, a caseworker set them up in a cramped one-bedroom apartment with another family. They lasted a week.

“We got sick there,” Bashir Kashefi said. “It was very difficult. Thirteen people to a bathroom, you can imagine.”

So the family set out on its own, homeless for two nights, sleeping on park benches with blankets and suitcases in tow.

On the third day, about 8:30 a.m., Kashefi told her husband she wanted to go home. They found a store and asked whether they could use the phone to call the police. Perhaps, the Kashefis thought, they would help them get back to Kabul.

“Don’t call 911. They might cause more problems for you,” Bashir Kashefi recalled an employee saying.

A man walked by. He also was from Afghanistan and overheard the conversation. He told the Kashefis that he could connect them to someone who could help. A few minutes later, Bashir Kashefi was on the phone with a woman who worked with Miry’s List.

The woman contacted Whitehill, who urged the Kashefis to stay, sent a taxi and put them up in a hotel for two days, then paid for their stay in a motel for a month. The organization helped them find the apartment they live in now and helped Bashir Kashefi find a car so he could get to his job as a security guard in Fullerton.

“I am glad that we didn’t go back,” he said.

As the dinner party wound down, conversations shifted to the difficulties of the resettlement process. Bashir Kashefi and his wife were lucky because he speaks English, some diners observed. They wondered what happened to families who knew only their native tongue.

“That’s just so wrong,” Huynh, 38, said. Her parents are Vietnamese refugees, she added.

Huynh and Yap, who’d driven in from La Verne, turned to Kashefi, curious about how she was adjusting to her life in Anaheim. Did she like the city? Had she been to Disneyland? Does she still have family to call in Afghanistan?

Kashefi opened the purse resting at her side and pulled out her phone. She showed them photos of her family — the brother she hopes will join her in California, then a picture of her mother. She kissed the screen.

“I couldn’t live without talking to her,” she said.

Moments later, a hush fell over the room as Bashir Kashefi stood and addressed the crowd. Passing around photos of himself alongside U.S. troops, he explained how much he loved America.

The country has grown on his wife too, he said.

“I ask my wife now, ‘Do you want to go back?’ and she says, ‘No.’”

The crowd rose to their feet, welcoming the family with a standing ovation.","Since resettling in the U.S. from Syria, Abeer Aljrafi has participated in monthly dinners hosted by the L.A.-based nonprofit Miry’s List.

274,He voted for Trump. Now he and his wife raise their son from opposite sides of the border,Jenny Jarvie,"She is there when he wakes up, telling him she loves him and helping him coax their son, Ashton, to finish his Honey Nut Cheerios before the school bus whisks him to kindergarten.

She is there when he is at work delivering UPS packages, and she’s there to greet their 6-year-old when he gets home from school, bounces up and down the stairs, and pulls the arms and legs of his Stretch Force Fireman.

Yet Jason Rochester’s wife, Cecilia, is not really there.

Her dark-brown eyes gaze out of a slick iPad screen and her voice floats through a tiny hole in the side of the machine.

I can’t sleep. I keep waking up every hour.

What are you wearing today, Ashton? Shorts or pants?

Papi, I want to see you. Can you stay in front of the camera?... Come on.

Forced apart by President Trump’s stringent immigration policies, Jason Rochester and Cecilia Gonzalez have spent the last 16 months raising their 6-year-old son from opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Like so many separated families, the couple have experienced the years of Trump’s presidency as a grim journey of restless nights and tearful goodbyes. But unlike many in their predicament, Jason voted for Trump.

He knew Trump planned to get tough on immigration — building a wall and deporting drug dealers, rapists and killers. He never imagined anyone would consider his sweet stay-at-home wife a “bad hombre.”

A white delivery driver born and raised in the tiny Alabama town of Smiths Station, Jason, 43, is a laid-back evangelical Christian, and the kind of man who takes the time to ask a customer how her baby carriage turned out and coo over its color.

About 15 years ago, a few years after he moved to the northern suburbs of Atlanta, he met Cecilia at work as he began a shift unloading packages.

She was petite — at 5-foot-4, just an inch shorter than him, with big brown eyes. He was instantly smitten.

Los Angeles Times

Whenever he spotted her tugging at a heavy box, he would haul the package off the semitrailer.

Day after day, they sat together on their 15-minute breaks, sharing pizza and chicken wings. Sometimes he would bring her dandelions from the side of the road. Occasionally she let him rub her shoulders.

But she didn’t offer much about her background — all he knew was she was from somewhere near Guadalajara, Mexico — and after two years he had failed to persuade her out on a date.

Eventually, a Mexican co-worker told him: “She’s illegal.”

He didn’t care.

When they eventually started dating, Cecilia told him that she had crossed the border into California several times in her early 20s. Immigration officials had caught her twice, first after crossing in Calexico and then in San Ysidro.

“Why would you want to be with me, knowing I’m like that?” she asked.

“I love you for who you are,” he told her.

After a year of dating, Jason proposed. They got married in his uncle’s backyard. Then came Ashton. Cecilia gave up her job cleaning hotels and settled into life as a stay-at-home mom in this affluent Atlanta suburb, making Ashton pancakes and grits for breakfast and taking him for strolls to the local park.

“You’re not a criminal,” Jason tried to reassure her. “You don’t have to worry about it.”

Jason had faith that the Trump administration would distinguish between good and bad immigrants. Cecilia had never even gotten a traffic ticket.

“In my mind, bad hombres were people who did bad things,” he said. “We figured that he was going to get rid of the people we didn’t want.”

So he voted for Trump, assuring himself and his wife that the ultimate decision was in God’s hands.

A few days after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that expanded Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s focus to most of the 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, regardless of whether they had a criminal record.

From the beginning, Cecilia eyed Donald Trump warily.

It was clear he never had anything good to say about immigrants, at least not anyone from her country.

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” Trump said in 2015 when he announced his presidential bid. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems.… They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

Jason didn’t like much of what Trump said on immigration either.

An independent voter who leans conservative, he voted for Barack Obama in 2008, hoping he would fix the immigration system and make it easier for Cecilia to pursue citizenship.

But this time, immigration was not his main concern.

Jason listened to conservative Christian radio, and his favorite talking heads, like James Dobson, the evangelical psychologist who founded Focus on the Family, convinced him that electing Trump would lead to a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.

Cecilia urged him to pay attention to Trump’s vows to build a wall along the southern border and amass a huge “deportation force.”

Jason told Cecilia not to worry, that the government wasn’t interested in her.

But she became increasingly fearful, scanning Univision broadcasts and local Facebook pages and showing him stories of people picked up by “la migra” when they were leaving for work or walking their kids to the school bus.

As immigration arrests surged, Cecilia became afraid to take Ashton to the park. She stopped driving. Her hair fell out in thick clumps.

What would happen if they came for her? Cecilia wondered. If they asked for her papers?

For the last few years, the couple had met with ICE once a year to renew Cecilia’s work permit. Under the Obama administration, ICE granted renewable work permits to many law-abiding immigrants who had been in the country at least five years.

But with their next appointment in November 2017, Jason and Cecilia had to decide: Should she go and risk being deported? Or should they skip the meeting, risking the possibility that ICE agents might knock on their door?

Ashton was 4. More than anything, Cecilia wanted to spare him the trauma of watching her be hauled away.

They decided to go to the ICE appointment with a plane ticket and a plan. If you allow us to spend Christmas and New Year’s together, they told the immigration agent, Cecilia would self-deport in January.

They were not sure it would work. As they waited at a cubicle, a woman sobbed as she was given a few moments to say goodbye to her young children. But the ICE agent agreed.

So they roasted a beef tenderloin over Thanksgiving and piled presents under the tree at Christmas. After New Year’s, Jason and Ashton flew with Cecilia to Guadalajara and took an Uber to her family’s home in the rural town of Juanacatlán.

It was Jason’s first time in Mexico and he was shocked by the poverty of her hometown. Stray dogs roamed the dirt roads, and mosquitoes buzzed inside homes with no air conditioning or drinkable tap water. Locals ran tiendas inside their rundown homes.

Unbelievable to him, there was no McDonald’s or Walmart.

Until then, Jason had not really grasped why his wife took the risk of crossing the border for a better life.

But God wanted his family to be together, he felt sure. Eventually, immigration officials would consider that Cecilia was married to an American citizen and had a child in the U.S.

“Mommy will be home soon,” he promised Ashton.

Not long after Jason got back to the U.S., their attorney told him Cecilia was permanently barred from returning.

It should not have been a surprise — Cecilia had lived in the U.S. for nearly two decades after being caught twice illegally crossing the border — but Jason was crushed when the lawyer said there was nothing more she could do. They would have to wait 10 years before they could ask for permission to reapply to enter the country.

Jason could not imagine Cecilia living in Juanacatlán, so they decided she should move to Mérida, the capital of Yucatán state and known as one of Mexico’s safest major cities. Jason’s mother moved from Alabama to Georgia to help care for Ashton.

In the summer, Ashton would visit Cecilia while Jason tried to figure out how to bring her back.

But there was a setback in July, not long after Ashton arrived in Mérida.

Cecilia was rubbing lotion on Ashton when she noticed a protrusion under his rib cage. After snapping a picture and texting it to Jason, she took Ashton to a hospital.

Ashton had a Wilms tumor, a cancerous mass in his left kidney the size of a cantaloupe. Jason flew to Mexico and rushed Ashton back to the U.S. for treatment.

After surgery to remove Ashton’s kidney, there was radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Ashton screamed every time he had blood taken.

“Why isn’t mommy here?” he asked.

“The government doesn’t want her here,” Jason tried to explain. “Mommy messed up years ago and we’re trying to get her back.”

Frantic, Cecilia considered trying to cross the border again. But Jason urged her to follow the law. God will reward us, he said.

They applied for humanitarian parole, assuming everything would be resolved in a few days. Even the most hard-hearted immigration official, they figured, would make an exception for a 5-year-old with cancer.

Nearly two months passed before they got word: Parole was denied.

As a white Trump voter, Jason makes an unlikely immigration activist.

He refers to immigrants as “illegals,” a term many advocates consider dehumanizing. He is indifferent about Trump’s “big, beautiful wall.” He suggests immigrants who have lived in the country without authorization should pay $10,000 fines.

But watching Cecilia miss walking Ashton to his first day of kindergarten or dressing him up as Sonic the Hedgehog for Halloween has pushed him to try to persuade Congress to overhaul immigration laws.

“Without a law change,” he said, “she’s not going to come back.”

Jason remains hopeful that Cecilia will return. More than 16 months after she left, her blouses, jeans and hoodies still hang in the bedroom closet.

Her Calvin Klein Contradiction perfume sits on the bathroom vanity. Her wooden crucifix hangs on the bedroom wall.

Now that Ashton is in the clear after months of chemotherapy and radiation, Jason is focused on changing the law so that, as he put it in an online fundraiser, “good people like my wife” can return to the U.S. to be with their “American citizen family.”

Immigrants who have a clear criminal record, he believes, should be ranked in order of priority.

“At the top of the list would be immigrants with an American spouse and American children,” he said. “And then go down to maybe an immigrant with an American spouse but no children and then just the children who are illegal.”

Yes, he conceded, such a system would cost money, but that could be offset by requiring immigrants to pay a fine.

“Isn’t it worth it to be humane?” he said. “To not just separate families?”

Sometimes Jason feels like an outlier in the nation’s polarized immigration debate. After 16 months apart from Cecilia, he has yet to meet another U.S. citizen who is married to an immigrant in the country illegally.

“We’re a very small demographic,” he said. “Usually, illegals are married to illegals.”

But Jason’s story is not uncommon. About 1.2 million immigrants who lack legal status — more than 1 in 10 — are married to a U.S. citizen, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Nearly a third have a child under 18 who is a U.S. citizen.

Still, Jason has struggled to win sympathy across the echo chambers of social media.

When Ashton was going through chemotherapy in October, Jason posted pictures on Twitter of his son in a hospital bed, tagging Trump. “Please read this and help my family!” he wrote. “I voted for you because I believed you would be fare to illegals and now my family is suffering!”

Trump did not respond, but others did, dubbing Jason a “hamburger brain” and a “sociopathic monster.”

“Trump doesn’t believe ‘good illegals’ exist,” one commenter wrote. “I feel bad for your boy. I have zero sympathy for you.”

“Why do Republicans lack all compassion until something happens to them directly?”

Jason tries not to let the partisan digs get him down, preferring to believe that people just don’t understand.

He probably wouldn’t vote for Trump again, he said. Still, he isn’t really sure that he made a mistake.

Sometimes he feels stupid or duped or betrayed. But then he thinks back to how he didn’t vote for himself personally but for the greater good — for what he sees as the “noble” cause of outlawing abortion.","Forced apart by President Trump’s stringent immigration policies, Jason Rochester and Cecilia Gonzalez have spent the last 16 months raising their 6-year-old son from opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.

290,Racing! Jon White’s final Belmont Stakes rankings,John Cherwa,"Hello, my name is John Cherwa and welcome to our horse racing newsletter as we head into Belmont weekend.

A little news before we get to the good stuff.

--Santa Anita suffers its 27th death since the meeting started on Dec. 26. Just click here.

--The topic at Belmont is all about horse safety and welfare. Just click here.

Jon White’s Belmont rankings

The Belmont Stakes is here and we’ve got Jon White ready to share his insights. Jon makes the morning line at Santa Anita, he’s a licensed steward, and he’s the pre-eminent historian on racing. We’re lucky to have him. So, here it is, the final rankings of the final leg of the Triple Crown , courtesy of Xpressbet.com. Jon, the floor is yours.

“1. War of Will (2-1 morning line). Only Curlin (1:53.46) in 2007 has registered a faster final time in the Preakness than War of Will (1:54.34) this year since Louis Quatorze (1:53.40) in 1996. Sure, the track for this year's Preakness was faster than usual. But even when taking that into consideration, I don't think War of Will is getting the credit he probably deserves for his Preakness performance. His final time was faster than such other Preakness winners in the last 20 years as California Chrome (1:54.84), Big Brown (1:54.86), Afleet Alex (1:55.04), Rachel Alexandra (1:55.08), Point Given (1:55.40), Lookin At Lucky (1:55.47) and Smarty Jones (1:55.59).

“Daily Racing Form's Matt Bernier wrote: ‘Most handicappers would immediately downgrade War of Will's effort because of the excellent trip he earned in Baltimore, but I think his effort may be better than it appears at face value.’ Bernier pointed out that in the Preakness, War of Will was relatively close to a hot pace, yet still ended up with the fourth-fastest come home time in the race.

“Meanwhile, do you realize that when War of Will had a wide trip and finished fifth in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf at Churchill Downs last Nov. 2, he managed to beat none other than the future winner of the historic Epsom Derby? That's right. At last year's Breeders’ Cup, 15-1 War of Will outran 3-1 favorite Anthony Van Dyke, who finished ninth. That very same Anthony Van Dyke won the 240th running of the original Derby of them all at Epsom Downs last Saturday.

“War of Will has the distinction of being the only one of the 10 entrants in Saturday's 151st running of the Belmont to start in all three Triple Crown events this year. Of course, running in those three races at three different distances at three different tracks within the period of five weeks is a grind. Sweeping all three is difficult and rare. There have been just 13 Triple Crown winners, the most recent being Justify last year.

“Because War of Will is being asked to endure the entire Triple Crown grind, his task to win the 1 1/2-mile Belmont is made more difficult by having to face rivals--most notably Tacitus--who are fresher for not having run in the Preakness. This definitely is a concern when it comes to War of Will.

“But keep in mind the Preakness really was only War of Will’s second meaningful race since he won the Risen Star Stakes on Feb. 16. He certainly did not get much out of the March 23 Louisiana Derby . War of Will took an awkward start shortly after the start of the Louisiana Derby and finished ninth. He emerged from that race with a strained patellar ligament, according to trainer Mark Casse . Inasmuch as the May 4 Kentucky Derby (in which he was impeded approaching the five-sixteenths marker) and May 18 Preakness have been War of Will's only real meaningful races since Feb. 16, he might have more gas in his tank for the Belmont than a lot of people think.

“2. Tacitus (9-5 morning-line favorite). I wrote last week that in terms of Belmont Stakes betting, I expect Tacitus to be the favorite, but not by a lot over War of Will. Belmont Park oddsmaker David Aragona obviously sees it the same way as he has pegged Tacitus as the 9-5 morning-line favorite, with War of Will a close second choice at 2-1.

“It's not difficult to understand why so many people are picking Tacitus to win the Belmont. He has a lot going for him.

“By not running in the Preakness, Tacitus has the advantage of being fresher for the Belmont than War of Will.

“Tacitus' trainer, jockey, owner and breeding also add to the colt's appeal. His trainer is Hall of Famer Bill Mott, who sent out Drosselmeyer to win the 2010 Belmont. Tacitus' jockey is Jose Ortiz, who won the 2017 Belmont aboard Tapwrit. Juddmonte Farms owns Tacitus. Juddmonte Farms won the 2003 Belmont with Empire Maker. Tacitus is a son of Tapit and 2014 Eclipse Award champion older female Close Hatches. Tapit has sired three of the last five Belmont Stakes winners (Tonalist in 2014, Creator in 2016 and Tapwrit in 2017).

“After winning the Tampa Bay Derby and Wood Memorial when he overcame a troubled trip, Tacitus exhibited good late energy in the Kentucky Derby. As far back as 16th early in the Run for the Roses, Tacitus finished fourth on the sloppy track and was elevated to third through the disqualification of Maximum Security . Maximum Security finished first but was DQ'd to 17th for causing interference to War of Will, Bodexpress and Long Range Toddy approaching the five-sixteenth pole.

“All in all, Tacitus has an excellent chance to be posing for pictures after Saturday's Belmont.

“3. Sir Winston (12-1). Casse trains Sir Winston in addition to War of Will. Sir Winston rallied to finish second in the 1 1/8-mile Peter Pan Stakes on May 11 at odds of 14-1, an effort that could set him up nicely for the longer Belmont Stakes.

“Not one of the 10 entrants in this year's Belmont Stakes has won on the Belmont Park main track. Sir Winston is the only one of the 10 to have finished at least second. His pedigree suggests he might relish long-distance races. His sire is Awesome Again, who won the 1 1/4-mile Breeders' Cup Classic in 1998. Sir Winston's maternal grandsire is 2005 Belmont winner Afleet Alex.

“Sir Winston's jockey is Joel Rosario , who won the 2014 Belmont on Tonalist.

“4. Spinoff (15-1). He seemed to detest running on the sloppy surface in the Kentucky Derby and wound up 18th. Spinoff finished second in the Louisiana Derby on March 23, a particularly good effort considering it was only his second race since last Aug. 12. In his 2019 debut, Spinoff raised eyebrows when he won by nearly 12 lengths at Tampa Bay Downs on Feb. 22.

“Spinoff's trainer is Todd Pletcher , who has won the Belmont three times (Rags to Riches in 2007, Palace Malice in 2013 and Tapwrit in 2017). Spinoff's jockey is Hall of Famer Javier Castellano , who has finished second in the Belmont three times ( Stay Thirsty in 2011, Commissioner in 2014 and Destin in 2016).

“5. Intrepid Heart (10-1). He's trained by Pletcher. As mentioned, Pletcher has three Belmont Stakes victories to his credit. The Belmont Stakes has been a longtime goal for Intrepid Heart.

“Unraced as a 2-year-old, Intrepid Heart crushed maidens when unveiled at Oaklawn Park on Feb. 18. He then won a race at Keeneland by a half-length on April 5. Sent off as the favorite at a little under 6-5 in the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont, Intrepid Heart stumbled at the start and finished third, 4 3/4 lengths behind runner-up Sir Winston. Global Campaign won the Peter Pan by 1 1/4 lengths.

“It's certainly understandable why the Belmont Stakes seems a good fit for Intrepid Heart because he's by Tapit (sire of three Belmont winners) and a half-brother to Commissioner, who at odds of 28-1 finished second, a head behind Tonalist, in the 2014 Belmont.

“Intrepid Heart's jockey is Hall of Famer John Velazquez , who has won the Belmont twice (Rags to Riches in 2007 and Union Rags in 2012).

“My main concern regarding Intrepid Heart is he's running in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont with just three races under his belt. But at least all three races have been at a mile or longer.

“6. Everfast (12-1). When he finished second in the Preakness at odds of 29-1, he spoiled a great many exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers. That wasn't the first time he's finished second at big odds. He ran second in Gulfstream Park's Holy Bull Stakes last Feb. 2 when dismissed at 128-1. Between the Holy Bull and Preakness, Everfast lost three races by 18 1/2, 15 and 10 1/4 lengths.

“Everfast races for Brad Kelley's Calumet Farm. For Kelley, Oxbow finished second in the 2013 Belmont. Calumet Farm (long before Kelley assumed overship) won the Belmont twice, both times with a Triple Crown winner (Whirlaway in 1941 and Citation in 1948).

“7. Tax (15-1). Runner-up in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 6, Tax was no factor in the Kentucky Derby when he finished 15th and was moved up to 14th through the disqualification of Maximum Security. Other than the Kentucky Derby, he has never finished worse than third.

“Irad Ortiz Jr. will pilot Tax in the Belmont. Ortiz won the 2016 Belmont with Creator.

“8. Bourbon War (12-1). He certainly had his share of supporters in the Preakness. Indeed, Bourbon War's 5-1 odds in that race were shorter than War of Will's 6-1. Bourbon War lacked early speed in the Preakness, never menaced and finished eighth.

“Bourbon War is another this year who could possibly give Tapit a fourth Belmont victory as a sire.

“In the Preakness, Bourbon War raced with blinkers for the first time. Trainer Mark Hennig is removing Bourbon War's blinkers for the Belmont.

"" Mike Smith is Bourbon War's jockey. Hall of Famer Smith and Justify collaborated to take the 2018 Belmont when that colt became this country's 13th Triple Crown winner. Smith also won the Belmont in 2010 aboard Drosselmeyer and in 2013 on Palace Malice.

9. Master Fencer (8-1). After winning two of six starts in his native Japan, Master Fencer exceeded the expectations of many in the Kentucky Derby. Virtually ignored by bettors, he lost by only four lengths at odds of 58-1 after being as far back as 23 lengths early. He finished seventh and was elevated to sixth via the DQ of Maximum Security. In light of Master Fencer's Kentucky Derby rally, perhaps he will have a big say in the longer Belmont. But at morning line odds of 8-1, I just can't get enthused.

“10. Joevia (30-1). He is expected to show early speed, as he did when he splashed his way to a 2 3/4-length triumph on a sloppy track May 12 in the 1 1/16-mile Long Branch Stakes at Monmouth Park. When Tacitus and Tax finished first and second, respectively, in the April 6 Wood Memorial at the Big A, Joevia ended up seventh and was disqualified to 11th for causing interference early.

“In a nutshell, it will be a gigantic upset if Joevia wins the 2019 Belmont Stakes.”

Santa Anita preview

Friday’s card at Santa Anita is pretty uninspiring, but the track is likely saving things up for Belmont Stakes day. There are eight races, starting at 1 p.m. with five races for Cal-breds and four on the turf.

Combine those two factors and you come up with a feature, the fifth, a Cal-bred allowance/optional claimer for horses going five furlongs on the turf. The favorite, at 5-2, is Psycho Dar, who is coming off a second in a allowance. He’s been running a lot of nongraded (but yet black type) races. He’s two-for-12 lifetime and trained by Steve Miyadi and jockey Edwin Maldonado.

The second favorite, at 3-1, is Prodigal Son for Doug O’Neill and Martin Garcia. Now, this is a Paul Reddam horse and Mario Gutierrez isn’t riding him. Trouble in paradise? Nope, Mario is just back in Belmont riding some of Reddam’s better horses. Prodigal Son is one-for-four lifetime and third last out in an allowance. Post is aroud 3:10 p.m.

Here are the field sies, in order: 10, 5, 6, 5, 9 (2 also eligible), 6, 9 (4 ae), 8 (1 ae).

Ciaran Thornton’s SA pick of the day

RACE SEVEN: No. 9 Incredibly Lucky (8-1)

Incredibly Lucky tries turf for the first time, shortens up and drops for trainer Bill Spawr who is winning 25% at the meet, is 22% off the bench and 33% maiden to maiden claiming like today. Main jockey Tiago Pereira is 33% for this stable. We are getting 8-1 or more in this wide open race. This horse was bet to odds on in both starts so expectations were high. We also get a sharp work and the horse races protected today. Excellent value play for us.

Sunday’s result: It was another closing second-place finish for us, the second in a row. Heather’s Grey sat off the pace for the entire race positioned perfectly before gaining at the wire to run second. There was no catching the gate to wire winner but a nice performance by Heather’s Grey. Suprema ran dead last but our other selections ran 1-2-3 for a nice trifecta win.

Golden Gate weekend preview

We’re back with our weekly look at the best racing at Golden Gate Fields. As with the last couple meetings, we’re delighted to have race caller and all-around good guy Matt Dinerman as our host for previews and other musings. But this is his last one of the meeting as Golden Gate takes a break on Sunday. But, Matt will be back, so, take it away for the last preview of this meeting.

“With three more live racing days on the calendar, Golden Gate Fields has a number of competitive, quality races lined up. Nine races are posted on the Friday overnight, with first post set at 12:45 p.m. The fifth race has a field of 12 on the turf and goes as Leg C of the Stronach 5 wager, with a guaranteed pool of $100,000. My top pick is the 2-1 morning-line favorite Thorn Hill Cat, who last lost to Sith Lord, who came back to run a terrific second in a starter allowance. Thorn Hill Cat competes in a $20,000 claimer on Friday.

“There’s 11 races Saturday, with the feature going as the Albany Stakes. An appealing Golden Pick Six sequence includes a pair of competitive maiden special weights, an allowance for 3-year-old fillies and the $50,000 Albany Stakes.

“The Albany, which goes as the ninth race, is for 3-year-olds and up going five furlongs on the turf. Southern California shipper Brandothebartender draws the rail for his second lifetime start on the Golden Gate turf and may go off favored. The son of Tribal Rule comes off a fourth-place finish in the Grade 3 Daytona Stakes at Santa Anita. My top pick in the race is Mike’s Tiznow, who looks like the lone speed and adores the five-furlong turf distance and surface. He’s 8-1 on the morning line and draws ghe seven for trainer Andy Mathis and jockey Ricky Gonzalez.

“Closing day Sunday has a 12-race program, with first post time at 1:15 p.m. The $0.20 Golden Pick Six, the Rolling Super High Five and the early and late Pick 5 wagers have mandatory payouts on Sunday, which means larger than normal pool sizes. Heading into Friday’s card, the Golden Pick Six has a carryover of just over $36,000. Also, we have a guaranteed late Pick 4 pool of $100,000 on Sunday.

“In other news, Golden Gate Fields welcomes back jockey Kyle Frey. The journeyman rider took an extended period of time off after sustaining a serious leg injury over the summer at Del Mar. Frey has two listed mounts on Saturday afternoon and five more on Sunday. “I’m really excited to get back to riding,” Frey said. “I’ve been working horses and feel really healthy. I’ll be ready to go this weekend.”

“Going into Friday, Jockey Abel Cedillo has 126 wins and sits atop the jockey standings. Juan Hernandez has the second most wins amongst riders with 103. Jonathan Wong has wrapped up a fourth consecutive training title at Golden Gate Fields with a whopping 85 wins at the winter/spring meet. Jerry Hollendorfer holds second place with 41 wins while John Martin completes the top three placing’s, equating 34 victories at the current meeting.

“Thank you to all of the horseplayers, fans and horsemen for a fantastic winter/spring meet. Live racing resumes on Thursday, Aug. 15, the first day of our summer meeting, which runs through Sunday, Sept. 29. Have a great summer.”

Los Alamitos weekend preview

It’s time to turn things over to marketing and meda guru Orlando Gutierrez, who will tell us about the upcoming weekend at Los Alamitos. Orlando, the floor is yours.

“Los Alamitos will open at 8 a.m. for simulcasting of the Belmont Stakes card from New York. The clubhouse and Vessels Club will open at 9 a.m. to bring all the great East Coast racing action. On Saturday night, Los Alamitos will host an eight-race program featuring thoroughbred and quarter-horse racing starting at 6:35 p.m.

“The racing week kicks off on Friday night starting at 7 p.m. There will four stakes, including Steve McIntyre and Marin Jones’ Grade 2 PCQHRA Breeders Futurity winner Cole Man 47, who will be headline the seventh race at 300 yards. Named after McIntyre’s grandson, Cole Man 47 won the John Deere California Juvenile Challenge in addition to his Breeders’ Futurity triumph. He's been a factor in several other stakes races, qualifying to the Grade 1 Los Alamitos Winter Derby earlier this year and last year's Robert Adair Kindergarten Futurity. Paul Jones will saddle the Utah-bred gelding by Stel Corona, who'll start from the four.

“Tac Me Up, the winner of the Autumn Handicap last year, and Genuine Version, winner of the 2017 Adequan California Derby Challenge, are also in this event.

“Multiple stakes winner Run Raging Rhino Run, who has scored black type wins at 550 and 870 yards this year, will head the evening's third race -- an allowance event around the turn.

“There are 11 races Sunday night and all of them trials at 350 yards to the Grade 1 Ed Burke Million Futurity. Ten of the 11 trials will have eight-horse fields with seven horses slated for the fourth race. The Ed Burke hopefuls include Mental Error and Dreams Divine, the second- and third-place finishers in the Grade 2 Robert Adair Kindergarten Futurity last month. The horses with the 10 fastest times will advance to the Ed Burke Million final on Sunday, June 23.”

Ed Burgart’s LA pick of the day

FIFTH RACE: No. 5 Fayvorite Chick (7-2)

Filly looked solid in last 12.4 gate drill in preparation for debut and is out of productive dam Chicks Tell, who dropped 2019 debut winner Tell Cartel last month.

312,"In Pacific Palisades, a meditation retreat lets you escape from yourself",Lori Basheda,"A few days before I was to take my vow of silence, my long-suffering husband suggested that maybe I should start practicing that night. I laughed but admitted he might be right. I’m a talker, so I was feeling a little nervous. I was checking into the Self Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine retreat in Pacific Palisades on Friday afternoon for two days of silence, contemplation and meditation. Before handing over your room key, they give you a pin to wear that says: “I’m Silent.” This is to alert staff and day visitors to the gardens or temple not to strike up a conversation. I was taking a 48-hour vacation from my own voice — and my cellphone and social media. The tab: $170 for two nights and six meals.

THE BED

Six people are on retreat at any given time; you are assigned your own room. Mine, which had a twin bed, had a view of the ocean in the distance. It was spotless. There is no TV, but a desk with reading material about Paramhansa Yogananda. The yogi who founded Lake Shrine had arrived here from India in 1920 and took “America by storm,” as one framed headline read in the gift shop. The only bummer was the whoosh of traffic on Sunset Boulevard.

THE MEAL

A gong sounds to let you know when breakfast, lunch and dinner are served in the dining room. Meals are around a wooden table in front of a picture window with a distant ocean view. We smiled at one another and took any chair. All meals are vegetarian and delicious: pepper frittata, butternut squash ravioli and carafes of hot herbal tea. The only sound is classical music — and chewing. It’s odd spending an entire weekend with four strangers, sharing every meal and never knowing their names.

THE FIND

Members of the public enjoy the solace of the lake in the Meditation Gardens at the Lake Shrine Self Realization Fellowship silence retreat. Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times

The gardens are open to the public from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily except Mondays, but if you’re on retreat you can head to the lake any time from dawn until dusk to be alone with the swans. It is a lovely sanctuary filled with flowers. A statue of Jesus stands on top of a waterfall. A stone sarcophagus contains some of Mahatma Gandhi’s ashes. A statue of Buddha sits on a hillside, and Krishna plays his flute in a grotto. This is where Yogananda wrote part of his spiritual classic “Autobiography of a Yogi.”

THE LESSON LEARNED

I felt as if I were cheating on my vow of silence because I could still hear my voice blabbering in my head. But the weekend was rejuvenating. I felt my nervous energy slip away, beginning with the Friday night guided meditation in the temple. You are allowed to keep your phone, by the way, and even turn it on to take photos, so you could text. But what would be the point? The idea is to connect with your higher spirit, which you won’t find on the internet.","I was checking into the Self Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine retreat in Pacific Palisades on Friday afternoon for two days of silence, contemplation and meditation.

319,"Meet John Cox and Gavin Newsom, the candidates for California governor",Phil Willon,"The hard-fought primary campaigns for California governor are over, and the candidates left standing are Republican John Cox and Democrat Gavin Newsom .

The two will face off in the Nov. 6 general election in what is expected to be a testy race. Expect to see millions in campaign donations pour in, a fair share of attack ads and lots of chatter about President Trump .

For Cox, the path to victory is formidable. The Rancho Santa Fe businessman has never been elected to public office, despite several tries. Cox is not well known in California, and no Republican has won a statewide race in California since 2006. Democrats have a 19-percentage-point edge over Republicans in voter registration and, as of May, the GOP trailed behind Californians registered as “No Party Preference.”

Cox’s biggest coup in the primary race was nabbing the endorsement of President Trump. That helped him consolidate the Republican vote, assisting his rise to second place in the primary — but Trump’s nod likely will hurt him in November. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton crushed Trump by more than 4.2 million votes in California in the 2016 presidential election .

Newsom faces potential pitfalls as well. The Democrat has defended the gas tax and vehicle fee increases approved by the state Legislature and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown . Funds from the increases will pay for much-needed transportation infrastructure projects in California, but the hikes are unpopular among voters. A statewide ballot measure to repeal the gas tax appears headed to the November ballot, and that may help Cox, who is chairman of the repeal campaign.

California also has the nation’s highest effective poverty rate, an affordable housing crisis and has seen a rapid increase of homelessness. Newsom has acknowledged that the Democrats “own” those problems since they’ve been in power, and Cox already said those issues will be the foundation of his attacks against the lieutenant governor.

“Given the party registration in this state, it looks very good for Newsom,” San Jose State political scientist Melinda Jackson said. “I hesitate to say it’d be a cakewalk because people thought that Trump would be a very weak candidate against Hillary Clinton and look what happened. Never say never.”

John Cox

Republican John Cox Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times

Top jobs: Businessman and real estate investor

Biggest splash: Cox was endorsed by Trump.

Baggage: He’s lost each of his previous campaigns for public office.

Particulars: Cox, 62, lives in Rancho Santa Fe and is married with four children. He is a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago and earned a law degree at Chicago Kent College at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

The venture capitalist announced his gubernatorial bid in early March 2017. He has contributed millions of his own money to fund his campaign.

Although this is the first time Cox has run for public office in California, he is not a newcomer to campaigns. He ran for president in 2008, bowing out after failing to get any traction. When he lived in Illinois, Cox ran for the House and twice for the U.S. Senate , including a race against Barack Obama. He lost all three times and also lost a race for Cook County recorder of deeds.

Cox is chairman of a statewide initiative campaign to repeal the gas tax and vehicle fee increases approved by the Democrat-led California Legislature and Brown. The billions raised would pay for much-needed road and bridge repairs. Cox has donated $250,000 to the campaign.

The Republican also unsuccessfully pushed a ballot initiative to overhaul Sacramento by establishing a “neighborhood Legislature,” which would add 12,000 “citizen legislators” elected in neighborhoods to the 80 Assembly members and 40 senators who currently make up the California Legislature. The intent, he said, was to rid Sacramento of “crony” politicians and the influence of special interests.

Gavin Newsom

Democrat Gavin Newsom. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times

Top jobs: California’s lieutenant governor since 2011, mayor of San Francisco for two terms, from 2004 to 2011

Biggest splash: Newsom created a national firestorm as San Francisco mayor in 2004 when he ordered the city to issue same-sex marriage licenses.

Baggage: While mayor, he had an affair with his campaign manager’s wife.

Particulars: Newsom, 50 , lives in Marin County with his wife and four children. He is a graduate of Santa Clara University.

Newsom coasted to a first-place finish in the June 5 primary, beating a strong field of fellow Democrats that included former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , state Treasurer John Chiang and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin.

He launched his campaign for governor in February 2015, shortly after deciding not to challenge then-state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris for the U.S. Senate.

Newsom pushed for a statewide initiative to toughen California gun laws and supported a measure to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Voters approved both initiatives in the 2016 general election.

Newsom ran for governor in the 2010 election but dropped out after the entry of Brown, who went on to win. He ran for the lower-profile lieutenant governor’s office instead.

Newsom gained national attention as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 when he directed the city to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That was a catalyst for a nationwide political battle over the issue that ended when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the right of gays to marry in 2015.

321,Will California flip the House? The key races to watch,Christine Mai-Duc,"Election day is shaping up as a classic referendum on Donald Trump ’s presidency, and California is one of the main battlefields as Democrats try to seize control of the House.

The party that holds the presidency typically plays defense in a midterm vote. But Trump’s unpopularity is driving an extraordinary surge of voter hostility toward Republicans .

Democratic candidates here are raising staggering sums of money, driven mostly by increased enthusiasm by donors on the left and aided by ActBlue, the online fundraising platform for progressive candidates.

It’s especially pronounced in California, where the GOP is badly diminished after more than two decades of decline brought about by political and demographic changes.

The state’s expanding Latino population has grown more politically active and pro-Democratic in response to the belligerent tone sounded by many Republicans. The GOP’s embrace of religious conservatism also pushed many Californians away from the party.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which has tracked House and Senate races nationwide for decades, rates five of California’s 53 House contests as toss-ups; one as leaning Republican; and, on Monday night, moved the Republican-held 49th District from leaning to likely Democratic. All seven of those fiercely competitive races are for House seats held by the GOP.

Three others appear safe in Republican hands, but that could change if a Democratic wave were to become a political tsunami.

Congressional District 10

RATING: TOSS-UP

Sources: Nextzen, OpenStreetMap

On paper, this Central Valley district looks attractive for Democrats, who hold a 3-percentage-point registration advantage. But consistently higher GOP turnout has kept the seat in Republican hands. The district takes in all of Stanislaus County and the southern portion of San Joaquin County.

Latinos — who lean Democratic — make up nearly the same share of residents as whites, but their low turnout has also given Republicans an edge. This year, healthcare could be a major issue in the district, where more than 40% of residents are enrolled in California’s Medicaid program for low-income people.

THE CANDIDATES

Jeff Denham, left, and Josh Harder. Marty Bicek / Modesto Bee

Denham, who previously represented the area in the state Senate, was first elected to the House in 2010. Before entering politics, he served in the Air Force and later founded a company specializing in plastic packaging used in agriculture. Denham has emphasized the need for comprehensive immigration reform and his opposition to state plans to reduce the amount of water diverted from Northern California rivers for irrigation, a move being pushed by environmentalists.

He has tried to walk a tightrope on immigration in a district where immigrants make up more than 20% of residents, but his most recent work with the GOP leadership on a solution for “Dreamers” brought to the U.S. illegally as children imploded. His votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act and support the Republican tax plan could also hurt him. Still, Denham has proved an effective campaigner who is used to facing stiff challenges and winning.

An investor and former venture capitalist, Harder was born and raised in the district but spent most of the last decade attending school and working on the East Coast. He was vice president of a Silicon Valley venture capital firm before he moved home last year to run for Congress . The incumbent has portrayed Harder as a “Bay Area” candidate. The Democrat is currently working as a business instructor at Modesto Junior College.

Harder points out he was born and raised in the district and says he’s running to protect healthcare for residents and to “stand up to President Trump when he is wrong.” He supports Medicare for all and said the GOP tax bill was “a massive middle finger to California families.” He says his main focus if elected would be the valley’s water issues; he opposes the Delta Tunnel.

Denham has raised more than $4.4 million this election cycle; Harder raised just over $7 million. These figures don’t take into account money raised by outside groups.

Congressional District 25

RATING: TOSS-UP

Sources: Nextzen, OpenStreetMap

This is the sole Republican-held seat that is mainly in Los Angeles County, in a district that stretches from Simi Valley in Ventura County through the Santa Clarita Valley and into the high-desert cities of Lancaster and Palmdale.

Politics here have changed rapidly as Angelenos flee exorbitant home prices for affordable housing inland. Between 2012 and 2018, voter registration swung from a 5-percentage-point Republican advantage to a 4-percentage-point edge for Democrats.

Latinos make up nearly 40% of the population; Asians and blacks make up about 16%. Though there are still pockets of rural conservatives, the area has become increasingly diverse and suburbanized and has grown more politically competitive.

THE CANDIDATES

Steve Knight, left, and Katie Hill. Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times

Knight is a former state legislator and Palmdale city councilman who had a 18-year career as a Los Angeles police officer before running for office. A U.S. Army veteran who almost always votes along party lines, he has enjoyed solid support from the district’s sizable military and law enforcement communities.

Knight has survived tough challenges before, most recently in 2016, but his fundraising has been lackluster. He has touted his support for the 2017 Trump tax overhaul, but played down his opposition to abortion rights and his votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Hill is a former executive at PATH , a Los Angeles-based nonprofit providing services to the homeless. She describes herself as a “pragmatic progressive,” emphasizing her support for border security, lower prescription drug costs and new tax cuts for the middle class.

Hill, one of the Democrats’ most successful fundraisers in the nation this year, grew up in the district, lives with her husband on a farm near Santa Clarita, and isn’t shy about discussing her family’s gun collection as she calls for new restrictions on firearm purchases.

Hill has raised about $7.3 million this election cycle to Knight’s nearly $2.4 million.

This majority-minority district, home to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, has grown beyond its conservative roots. Most voters live in the dense suburbs of northern Orange County with Fullerton as its focal point; the district also includes the hilly communities of Diamond Bar and Rowland Heights in Los Angeles County and Chino Hills in San Bernardino County.

A burgeoning population of Asians and Latinos makes up about two-thirds of the district. Voter registration between the two parties is just about evenly split. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump here by nearly 9 points in 2016, and Democrats see the district as one of their best pickup opportunities, especially now that 13-term incumbent Ed Royce is retiring.

THE CANDIDATES

An immigrant from South Korea with an extensive political background, Kim is running in a district where more than a third of residents are immigrants and about a fifth of registered voters are Asian American. She worked for Royce for two decades before being elected to the state Assembly in 2014. She was unseated in 2016 by the same Democrat she’d previously defeated.

In her congressional campaign, Kim has promised to fight for lower taxes and has criticized California’s “sanctuary state” policy. Kim enjoys the backing of Royce, who is still well regarded among many in the district. But Trump’s immigration policies complicate Kim’s effort to broaden her appeal beyond Republicans. She would be the first Korean American woman elected to Congress.

Cisneros was a manager at Frito-Lay when he and his wife hit a $266-million lottery jackpot in 2010. Since then, the couple have become well-known in Democratic circles for their education-related philanthropy, including funding for a news assignment desk that bears their name at the USC Annenberg newsroom.

Cisneros has campaigned on affordable healthcare, stricter gun laws and passing the Dream Act . A former Republican who switched parties in 2010, Cisneros has emphasized his status as a Navy veteran. He has injected more than $8 million of his own money into his campaign so far.

Cisneros has raised more than $11.1 million, including the money he lent his campaign. Kim has raised about $2.5 million.

This was a heavily Republican district when Rep. Mimi Walters was first elected here in 2014. Since then, the GOP voter registration advantage has shrunk by half to about 8 percentage points; in 2016 Hillary Clinton outperformed Trump by 5 percentage points.

But no Democrat for congressional or statewide office has ever broken the 50% mark in this district, contained entirely within Orange County and stretching from Anaheim Hills south to Mission Viejo. More urban areas like Irvine are liberal and fast-growing; smaller, inland communities skew more conservative.

Sources: U.S. Census Bureau, California secretary of state

THE CANDIDATES

Mimi Walters, left, and Katie Porter. Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times

A former state legislator and Laguna Niguel city councilwoman, Walters has long run on a pro-business, anti-tax platform. She previously worked as a stockbroker, and co-owned a business with her husband that provided medical staff to California prisons. A resident of Laguna Niguel, Walters is one of several California members of Congress who do not live in the districts they represent.

Walters rallied her House colleagues to donate money to a ballot measure that would repeal the California gas tax hike, which Republicans hoped would spur GOP turnout. Walters has focused much of her attention on touting the Trump tax plan, which may actually raise taxes for many in her district by eliminating many deductions for state and local taxes. She has campaigned on her work to pass a bill establishing rights for sexual assault survivors in federal criminal cases and to fund firefighter training. Walters voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

A UC Irvine law professor, Porter is testing the limits of progressivism in this politically transitioning district. She supports single-payer healthcare and has cast herself as a consumer advocate who stood up to big banks when she was tasked with overseeing the distribution of California’s share of the national mortgage foreclosure settlement. She has criticized the 2017 tax plan and called for reform that would cut taxes for the middle class but not corporations. Porter broke with her party to oppose the increase in the California gas tax.

She’s mentioned her endorsements from U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris of California, who appointed her to that role, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A single mother of three, Porter spoke openly during the primary about her experience as a domestic abuse survivor.

Porter has raised about $5.9 million this election cycle, compared with $4.5 million raised by Walters.

THE CANDIDATES

Dana Rohrabacher , left, and Harley Rouda. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times

The 15-term incumbent got his start in politics as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and previously worked as an editorial writer for the Orange County Register. The image he’s built over the decades as a surfer with a libertarian bent has competed in recent years with his push for better relations with Russia, leading one publication to name him “Putin’s favorite congressman.”

Rohrabacher now appears to be trying to mobilize his loyalists by emphasizing hard-line immigration stances. He voted against the Trump tax plan, citing its potential harm to his constituents and its ballooning of the deficit.

Rohrabacher said in an ad put out just before the election that he wants to protect healthcare for people with preexisting conditions. However, he voted for the Republican American Health Care Act, a repeal of Obamacare that a Congressional Budget Office report said would undermine coverage for such people.

Rouda is an Ohio-born real estate investor who moved to Laguna Beach seven years ago. The former Republican became a Democrat last year after nearly two decades as a political independent.

Rouda has said he’s running to strengthen environmental protections and protect healthcare coverage; he favors giving people the option to join Medicare. He wants to provide a path to citizenship to participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

During the primary, Rouda fundraising emails called for Trump's impeachment, but now the candidate says he would wait for the outcome of the special counsel’s investigation — into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign’s links to Moscow — to decide on the matter.

Rouda has raised around $7.4 million to Rohrabacher’s nearly has $2.5 million.

THE CANDIDATES

Diane Harkey , left, and Mike Levin. Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times. Nick Agro / For The Times

Harkey is chairwoman of the state Board of Equalization, which oversees many of California’s tax collection policies. A former state legislator who worked in corporate finance and banking before entering politics, she has positioned herself as a pro-business candidate who will fight tax increases, oppose California’s sanctuary state law and scale back regulations. She’s said there’s “probably [a] need to beef up” the Affordable Care Act, questions how much the U.S. should regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, and says whether to arm teachers depends on where the school is.

She has had to fend off criticism over her ex-husband’s legal problems. Dan Harkey was accused of misleading investors at his lending company and was found liable for $10 million in damages after it went belly-up. The judgment was recently affirmed by a California appellate court.

Levin is an attorney specializing in environmental issues. He previously served as executive director of the Orange County Democratic Party and most recently was director of government affairs for FuelCell Energy, an energy storage company that focuses on carbon capture.

He supports single-payer healthcare, a $15 federal minimum wage and free tuition at community colleges. Levin says he wants to expand background check requirements for gun purchases and ban assault weapons and “bump stocks”; he opposes arming teachers. He supports a path to citizenship for participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Levin has raised nearly $5.6 million this election cycle to Harkey’s $1.5 million.

RATING: LEANS REPUBLICAN

This is one of the most conservative districts in California. Based in inland San Diego County and part of Riverside County, Republicans dominate nearly all of the major cities in this region. Trump won by 15 percentage points here in 2016 and Democrats make up just 27% of voters, the lowest share in any California congressional district.

There is a strong military influence here; more than 10% of adults are either veterans or active-duty service members, and residents here skew much older and whiter than those in other battleground districts Democrats are trying to capture this year. But the August federal indictment of the incumbent on felony charges of fraud, conspiracy and misusing campaign funds has led several election watchers to move this race into a more competitive column.

Duncan Hunter , left, and Ammar Campa-Najjar . Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call. Associated Press

DUNCAN HUNTER, 41, Republican incumbent Hunter was first elected in 2008 and succeeded his father, former GOP Rep. Duncan L. Hunter, who held the seat for nearly three decades. A Marine Corps veteran, Hunter enlisted in the military following the Sept. 11 attacks after spending several years in the computer industry. He has emphasized his work advocating for veterans issues and has said he supports Trump’s policies to secure the border.

Hunter and his wife, Margaret, were indicted in August on charges they used more than $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses, including payments to nail salons, their children’s private school and an airline ticket to fly the family rabbit. The Hunters have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which were the result of a months-long investigation by the FBI.

The incumbent, in speeches and a widely condemned ad, has tried to portray his Democratic opponent as a security risk based on his family ties. The Campa-Najjar campaign has called Hunter’s attacks “pathological.”

Campa-Najjar is a public affairs strategist who previously worked in the Department of Labor under President Obama and for Obama’s reelection campaign. He most recently was a communications director for the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Born to a Mexican mother and a Palestinian father, Campa-Najjar grew up mostly in the San Diego suburbs. He also spent a few years in the Palestinian territories.

The candidate says he’s committed to promoting peace in the Middle East and has said Hunter is trying to turn attention from his indictment with unfounded attacks. Campa-Najjar’s grandfather led a group of terrorists who killed 11 Israelis at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Campa-Najjar, a practicing Christian who held a government security clearance, has condemned the actions of his grandfather, who he notes was killed 16 years before the candidate was born.

Campa-Najjar, who graduated from San Diego State University, says he favors Medicare for all but would also support a version in which people 50 to 64 have an option to buy in. He supports the repeal of the gas tax increase.

Campa-Najjar raised more than $3.2 million this election cycle to Hunter’s $1.1 million.

Centered in California’s gold country, this district is one of the most rural in the state. It runs from Truckee, north of Lake Tahoe, through Yosemite and into Kings Canyon National Park to the south. The largest chunk of residents, who are overwhelmingly white, live in Placer and El Dorado counties, which include the populous and wealthy suburbs of nearby Sacramento.

Trump won here in 2016 with 54% of the vote, a good 15 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton. Winning this district is a real long shot for Democrats: It has the highest share of registered Republican voters in the state, and no Democrat except for Sen. Kamala Harris (who ran against a fellow Democrat) has ever won in any congressional or statewide race here.

McClintock built his reputation as an anti-tax, limited-government conservative starting in his mid-twenties, when he was elected to the state Legislature to represent Ventura County. He cast himself as “frugal Tom,” often referencing a cheap, dark JCPenney suit he wore for years. He mounted several failed campaigns for statewide office, including a bid in the 2003 recall election for governor. McClintock was first elected to Congress in 2008 to represent a seat hundreds of miles from his state Senate district.

He has emphasized reining in spending on social programs to control the national debt, as well as stricter enforcement of immigration laws. After voting against an early version of the GOP tax plan, McClintock changed his vote to help pass it. He voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. McClintock doubts the scientific community’s consensus that human activity is driving climate change and believes teachers with concealed-carry permits should be allowed to take guns on campus.

Morse is a national security strategist with a background working for the military, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Her portfolio included U.S.-India defense relations and a role coordinating aid to Iraq; detractors accuse her of inflating her resume and responsibilities.

Morse has pitched herself as a Northern California native, a contrast with McClintock, who lives in Northern California but outside the district. She has emphasized local issues such as protection of public lands and natural disaster and fire prevention policy. She wants to allow Americans to buy into the Medicare system and calls for comprehensive immigration reform, including modernization of work visa system.

Morse raised about $3.25 million this election cycle and McClintock has raised more than $1.6 million. These figures don’t take into account money raised by outside groups.

Congressional District 21

RATING: LIKELY REPUBLICAN

Sources: Nextzen, OpenStreetMap

This is a largely rural Central Valley district that, despite its hard tilt toward registered Democrats, has long been out of their grasp. Democrats have a registration advantage of 17 percentage points over GOP voters.

The region is home to both water-hungry industrial farms and massive oil drilling operations inland.

Latinos make up nearly three-quarters of the population and nearly 60% of registered voters. But their historically low turnout, as well as the independent-minded nature of Central Valley politics, makes this area more like a swing district. Issues such as immigration and healthcare are acutely felt in this largely poor, immigrant-heavy district.

Valadao comes from a family of Portuguese dairy farmers and was first elected to Congress in 2012. The son of an immigrant from the Azores Islands, Valadao often takes a softer line on illegal immigration than some of his GOP colleagues, a necessity in a region where agriculture depends on migrant labor.

A former state legislator who became involved in politics through the family business, Valadao sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a post he’s used to funnel federal funding back home. Valadao has withstood Democratic challengers mostly because of his focus on local issues such as irrigation and water storage. He voted for the 2017 Republican tax plan and to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Cox is an engineer and a business owner who founded two nut-processing companies. He now serves as president of the Central Valley New Markets Tax Credit Fund, a community development group focused on local investments.

Cox previously ran for Congress against former GOP Rep. George Radanovich in 2006 but lost by more than 20 points. He’s promised to push for a path to citizenship for participants of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and for affordable healthcare and safe drinking water. He supports a public buy-in for Medicare and says the GOP tax plan was a gift to corporations and the very wealthy.

Valadao has raised about $3.1 million this election cycle, while Cox raised almost $2.5 million. These figures don’t take into account money raised by outside groups.

Congressional District 22

RATING: LIKELY REPUBLICAN

Sources: Nextzen, OpenStreetMap

Unlike the other Central Valley districts on Democrats’ wish list this year, the 22nd is solidly Republican. The GOP has about 9% more registered voters than Democrats. Contained within Fresno and Tulare counties, it’s an area flush with large-scale dairy farms, vineyards and citrus groves.

The district also includes two major urban areas, with a majority of voters living in the cities of Fresno and Visalia. Latinos make up nearly half of the population but less than a third of the district’s voters, and the electorate has proved cycle after cycle to be reliably conservative, with Trump beating Clinton by nearly 10 percentage points.

THE CANDIDATES

Devin Nunes, left, and Andrew Janz. Associated Press. Alex Edelman / Getty Images

An eight-term incumbent first elected at age 29, Nunes has built formidable clout and a political war chest to match. He sits on the powerful Ways and Means Committee and is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. It’s in the latter post that Nunes has been thrust into the limelight, first as a leader in Congress’ investigation into Russian election interference and then during the furor over a memo he drafted about FBI surveillance of a former Trump campaign advisor.

Nunes has spent much of his career focused on water storage and irrigation. He is derisive on concerns over climate change, calling it “nonsense,” and says he wants more offshore oil exploration. He won reelection in 2016 with 68% of the vote. His high-profile role defending the Trump administration has brought a financial boon: As of Oct. 17, he had nearly $5 million in the bank.

Janz is a Fresno County prosecutor specializing in violent crimes. He grew up in Visalia, earned his law degree from Southwestern Law School and worked as a law clerk in Las Vegas before returning in 2014 to join the Fresno County district attorney’s office.

Janz has promised to protect Social Security and Medicare and bring in federal funding to improve water storage infrastructure. He has used Nunes’ notoriety to shore up his campaign coffers, too.

Nunes has raised over $11.8 million this election cycle, while Janz raised about $8.3 million.

326,"Joe Biden discusses why he didn't run in 2016, the field for 2020 and drag-racing Colin Powell",Patt Morrison,"Election year 2016 was like no other year in American history, but it was 2015 that left its mark on the life and the heart of former Vice President Joe Biden. He was at the Los Angeles Times’ Ideas Exchange last week to talk about his book “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” the year of the illness and death of his son Beau, and of his long debate with himself about running for president.

Click here for the full archive of ""Patt Morrison Asks"" podcasts »

As you dealt with your son’s illness, and tried to keep it private, you were also weighing whether to run for president.

I had planned on running before Beau got sick. I have great respect for Hillary [Clinton]. She would have made a hell of a president. But I thought I was far and away the most qualified person to finish the job Barack [Obama] and I started.

When Beau got sick, Beau was absolutely insistent that I not let anybody know. The people who had begun to organize for me, if I had told them, “Stop,” they would have known we didn’t expect Beau to live. So this developed into people thinking the reason I wasn’t running [was] because I was worried about Hillary.

When Clinton told you privately in early 2015 that she was running, you wrote, “She didn’t evince much joy at the prospect of running. She seemed to me like a person propelled by forces not entirely of her own making.” What were those forces?

I didn’t feel sorry for her, but I felt a little sad. Because she knew how brutal this was going to be. She’d been there before. She knew what she was going to go through — not that she couldn’t win, but it was going to be awful. And everybody thinks Hillary has this overwhelming ambition. I don’t see her that way. I saw her as a woman who thought it was her responsibility to run. A woman who knew that if she didn’t run, she’d be letting down millions of women around the world. She wouldn’t say this, but other people thought that was her manifest destiny. So this was nothing she was looking forward to.

95641043

It takes enormous courage. And I think Hillary would be able to die a happy woman never having been president of the United States. It wasn’t like this burning thing she had to do. Maybe earlier on it was. But I thought she felt an obligation. She knows all this, and she was ready to go do it. That’s what I meant.

You turned down Barack Obama when he first asked you about being his running mate, but your family — including your son Beau and your mother — had other ideas.

I never wanted to be vice president. I thought I could help [Obama] most [as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee], so I told him no. He said, ”I need an answer now,”and I told him no. Then he said, “Go home and talk it over with your family.” So we called a family meeting and to my great surprise everyone thought I should run, particularly Beau and [wife] Jill. I looked over at my mom and said, “Honey, you haven’t said anything.” And she said, “Remember I asked you about a month ago what Barack Obama was like? You said he’s a man of real character and you liked him.” I said, “Yeah, Mom.” She said, “Joey, let me get this straight — the first black man in American history who has a chance to be president, who says he needs you to win Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, and you told him no?” I said, “Dammit, Mom!” So I said yes. It turned out to be the best decision I ever made, but I really didn’t want to do it.

You and President Obama were so close that he joked that there were places in Indiana that wouldn’t serve the two of you pizza any more. What do you think as you’re watching the effort to dismantle the administration’s legacy?

We both worry about it. The most fundamental things we did, [President Trump] can’t dismantle. He can hurt the progress on same-sex marriage. He can try to dismantle the civil rights effort. But the American people have crossed the Rubicon on these things. This will be able to snap back. A lot of damage will be done in the meantime.

What I worry most about is the conduct of foreign policy. Unrelated to whatever idiosyncratic things bother us about him, he came to the office with no background whatsoever in this area. I worry about what he’ll do by omission almost as almost as hard as what he’ll do by commission. And I don’t think he fully realizes how consequential the words of a president are. The whole world listens. And it matters.

[New York Times columnist] David Brooks talks about this invisible moral fabric that holds up and gives buoyancy to our democratic system. My worry is that, as he says, it’s being rent, it’s being ripped apart by presidential actions.

And they’re not legislative in nature. I never thought I’d live to see the day when you’d see people literally coming out of fields with lighted torches, carrying Nazi flags, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile used in Hitler’s Germany. And those who countered them being told they were the moral equivalent of these folks. It gives license to the most unappealing aspects of humanity to crawl out from under the rocks.

What has been the unrelenting systemic attack for two years, coming from the alt-right? Going after the guys in the striped shirts, the referees: the press and the courts. That has been the history of the demise of every democracy in Europe from the late 19th century through the 20th. There’s a lot at stake and it’s less [Trump’s] policies than it is this abuse of power. And the American public’s not going to stand for it.

Would you assess the last year — the Trump year?

He should simply just grow up. Stop focusing everything through the prism of “me, me.” it is dangerous. And the damage that he’s doing is to our credibility around the world — I’ve got 14 heads of state calling me. And I’m not going to set up a separate foreign policy. But this borders on dangerous. My dad used to have the expression, “The only war worse than one that’s intended is one that’s unintended.” And this childish behavior of “my button is bigger than your button” — it’s not just ridiculously funny, it is dangerous.

Every serious [career] person in our administration, I begged them to stay in the [Trump] administration. There is a need for stability.

The president acts as if this [job] is about bargaining to determine who gets the last square footage downtown to build a skyscraper. It is so much more complicated.

Size up the Democratic field for 2020, starting with Oprah Winfrey and L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti.

I’d be happy to be on either one of their tickets — I’m a good vice president! Eric Garcetti has character. Eric Garcetti is smart as hell. He is strategic. This is a guy who’s extremely thoughtful. [Oprah] is bright, she is tough, she is consequential. Can she do it? Yes. Is that what she wants to do? I have no idea. You’ve got guys like [Sen. Cory] Booker from New Jersey — solid. Your new senator from California [Kamala Harris].

95641832

Our former [party] chairman [Howard Dean], said we should get rid of the old guys and get young blood. I agree with him. But here’s the deal: It requires ideas. And what are those new ideas? What are the attributes needed? We badly need someone who has a strategic view of America’s role in the world. You need to have a confidence that’s grounded in some deep sense of what your foreign policy should be. You need to be able to convince the American people that you’re totally authentic. You have to have the ability in my view to reach across the aisle. America cannot constitutionally function without consensus.

I saw that you’ve got a ’67 Corvette. You’d be right at home on the L.A. freeways.

I’m a hell of a good driver, man. For eight years, I wasn’t allowed to drive [for security reasons]. But I got one chance when Jay Leno said would I drag-race out at their test track [against former Secretary of State] Colin Powell in his big Corvette. I actually was able to take him. Then I tried a Porsche and got it up to 182 miles per hour. Anyway, I like cars.

Eaze, the San Francisco-based technology platform that’s been coordinating dispensary-to-consumer home deliveries of cannabis in Los Angeles since April, has expanded its reach — for CBD-containing products, that is — to most of the United States. (CBD, a.k.a cannabidiol, is a cannabis compound said to have anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety properties but none of the “high” associated with THC. These claims have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.)

(Shipping is free for orders $50 and up; otherwise, it’ll cost you $5.)

Much like its in-state marijuana-delivery service, which coordinates deliveries with local dispensaries, Eaze isn’t doing the shipping itself, but rather working with a third-party partner to get goods from brands such as Plant People, Cannuka, BeTrū Wellness and Vital Leaf from point A to point B.","Eaze Wellness offers non-psychoactive CBD products derived from hemp.

Rolling into the Friday launch party for his new cannabis brand Gas, the first thing Grammy-winning rapper 2 Chainz did was brandish a joint in one hand and a smartphone in the other to record the rows of boldly packaged cannabis flower and pre-rolled joints in a video to share with his 5.7 million Instagram followers. The second thing he did was stand back and take in the moment.

“I can’t believe it, that’s why I was over here just trying to take it all in,” 2 Chainz said about seeing all the green, yellow and black plastic pouches filled with marijuana, and a jerrycan converted into a display tray overflowing with green buds. “I’ve been told for over a year that we were doing this line, so now I’m just trying to live in the moment. I don’t do that a lot.”

California cities on Monday objected to a state proposal that would allow marijuana delivery to homes in areas where storefront pot sales have been banned locally.

The changes, which are being considered by the state Bureau of Cannabis Control, “will undermine a city’s ability to effectively regulate cannabis at the local level,” Charles Harvey, a legislative representative for the League of California Cities, said in a letter to the bureau.

The cities group, which represents the state’s 482 municipalities, supports other changes to clarify the rules of Proposition 64, which was approved by voters in 2016 and allows the growing and sale of marijuana for recreational use.","California cities are objecting to changes in the state's rules on marijuana that they say undermine local control.

434,What's L.A. reading? Our habits are as diverse as the city itself,Michelle Obama,"Do you know what Los Angeles County is reading? The answers might surprise you.

Every Wednesday, a small group of dedicated book lovers huddles in a library conference room not far from Sawtelle Japantown. On this afternoon, the group is reading the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez.

In Farsi.

But first there is tea, a nod to Iranian culture and the homeland left behind by these patrons of the West Los Angeles Regional Library. The tea is hot and dark and strong, sipped with a sugar cube held between the teeth.

This is Los Angeles County, as seen through the books we read. It encompasses Monrovia, where the most-circulated works include “Becoming,” Michelle Obama’s wildly popular memoir, and “The Library Book.” Susan Orlean’s love letter to literacy is also the first selection of the Los Angeles Times Book Club.

And it includes Glendale, whose readers checked out Kazu Kibuishi’s manga blockbuster “Amulet” more than any other volume in the first three months of 2019.

Author Susan Orlean is seen in the Los Angeles Central Library’s second-floor rotunda. Orlean wrote “The Library Book,” which tells of the 1986 fire that swept through the Central Library and is one of the most frequently requested books at libraries in Los Angeles County. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)

As the Times launches its new community book group, we decided to find out what the county is reading — and, therefore, thinking about. We surveyed 35 library systems, asking which books were most circulated in the first quarter of 2019 and which ones have the longest waiting lists. Twenty-eight responded, representing more than 200 branches.

The lists of most-popular titles were collected from systems as small as Signal Hill’s, which has one branch and 11,000 patrons, and as massive as the County of Los Angeles network, which has 85 public branches and serves more than 3.4 million people. They paint a detailed, multicultural portrait of the region.

Most popular library books “Becoming” by Michelle Obama

“Dark Sacred Night” by Michael Connelly

“The Reckoning” by John Grisham

“Crazy Rich Asians” by Kevin Kwan

“Educated” by Tara Westover

“Long Road to Mercy” by David Baldacci

“Past Tense” by Lee Child

“The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens

The blockbusters are all there; as the most populous county in the United States, Los Angeles is a big part of what made them bestsellers in the first place. Think “Becoming” and Michael Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night,” John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” and Kevin Kwan’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

But the data also highlight the region’s unique neighborhoods, places whose singularity is written in the books residents hold dear. At the Mark Twain Branch Library, in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles, the three most circulated books are two anthologies of horror stories and the MacArthur Study Bible.

Patrons of Santa Monica’s Main Library routinely fly a liberal flag; their top choice is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” by Bob Woodward. Glendora’s most-read book was Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham.” Among the favorites countywide were volumes in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, French, Portuguese and Farsi.

So, why use libraries to investigate the books readers here love most?

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has.” — John Szabo, Los Angeles city librarian

Because, as Los Angeles city librarian John Szabo explains, “rich folks use our libraries. Folks without homes, who are homeless, aren’t just coming here for air conditioning. They’re reading and they’re using our services, and that’s important to remember.

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has,” he said. “Folks in rural Sunland-Tujunga, who have horses, make use of our libraries. We serve everybody.”

A Persian epic and Iranian tea

The West L.A. Library Farsi Reading Club meets in a second-floor conference room with scraped up, Band-Aid-colored walls. Every session starts with sweets, a poetry reading and tea.

The gathering, said librarian Ramin Naderi, is a Southern California reflection of life in Iran’s neighborhood teahouses, where performers called naghāls recite sections of the “Shahnameh,” an epic poem of pre-Islamic Persia that first appeared in the year 1010.

On this rainy Wednesday afternoon, Naderi reads the wistful “Recalling Youth Days” by contemporary poet Rahi Moayeri, which is projected on the wall in sinuous Arabic script: … My fate didn’t grant me grey-headedness for anything/For these white strands, my youth was paying. …

Because there are never enough copies of Farsi books to go around, members also read aloud from the book of the moment. This week is Chapter 10 of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which related in part the story of Remedios the Beauty and her great-grandmother, Úrsula Iguarán. Úrsula is the wise Buendía family matriarch, Remedios an innocent who wanders around naked.

Farsi Reading Club are tackling the Farsi version of the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by ‎Gabriel García Márquez. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Which sparks a debate between Max Rahani, 73, and Raheleh Olomy, a decade his junior, about politics and the role of women. In Farsi, of course.

This is Rahani’s post-meeting English-language recap:

Olomy: “Why blame Remedios? Without clothes, she has freedom.”

Rahani: “If a woman has ideas and is nude, it’s OK. Maybe they are protesting.… If [they] are nude without any idea behind that, it’s not OK.”

The West Los Angeles library’s 10 most-read books start with Obama’s “Becoming” and end with “Ābī ārām,” by Iranian author, Bahārah Bāqirī, known for her romance novels. That “Becoming” would make the area’s list of the most-circulated is a no-brainer. But the popularity of “Ābī ārām” tells us more about the neighborhood, about who lives and reads there.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library is one of five in the Los Angeles Public Library system that had Farsi books on its most-read list. Five of the top 10 books at the the West Valley branch were in Farsi, as were three of the top 10 at the Encino-Tarzana branch and the branch in Westwood, a.k.a. “Tehrangeles.” Sylmar’s best-read list included two.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library’s Farsi-language collection is about the same size as its Spanish-language collection. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Where Chinese lit and ‘Wimpy Kid’ top the list

There are so many superlatives when it comes to the population of Los Angeles County, and they all play out in the region’s libraries. It has more Iranians than any other county in the United States. Nearly 50% of the population is of Hispanic origin. The largest Chinese population of any county in the nation is here too.

At the Chinatown Branch Library, for example, the 10 most-requested books are all Chinese-language volumes. No surprise there. But the sole branch in pricey San Marino’s one-library system also lists Chinese-language books among its most circulated.

City Librarian Irene McDermott notes that the 2010 census showed 53% of residents identify as Asian in San Marino. That helps explain why three of the most-circulated adult books at the Crowell Public Library are in Chinese: “Stories of Lian Jiang,” “Love in Cold Palace” and “Struggles in the Palace.”

But if you look at all books, not just adult reading, the San Marino top 10 takes a dramatic shift. Yes, “Stories of Lian Jiang” and “Love in Cold Palace” still make the grade, at No. 3 and 4 most-circulated respectively. But all the rest of the books are for children, with “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” titles at spots No. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10.

“Oh, to be Jeff Kinney!” McDermott said, referring to the author who created beleaguered seventh-grader Greg Heffley, star of 13 Wimpy Kid books, with a 14th due in November, and four movies. When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

At the Santa Monica Public Library’s Pico Branch, the second and third most checked-out books are aimed at the short set. There’s “Geronimo Stilton,” an Italian series detailing the exploits of an adventurous mouse of the same name. And “Disney Fairies” — need we say more?

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended.” — Santa Monica director of library services Patty Wong

Patty Wong, Santa Monica director of library services, lauds the quality of children’s books, one reason she says they’re so popular. Not only do most have top-notch illustrations, but they’re “probably the strongest-edited of the materials out there.” They also have big crossover audiences.

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended,” she said. They also resonate with “early learners and English-language learners. When I was in Berkeley and doing a lot of work with non-English speakers, specifically Japanese … a lot of older Japanese speakers wanted to learn more about American culture through our children’s books.”

All about Michelle Obama’s journey — or your own

Self-help books make a big splash, in keeping with Szabo’s tenet that “libraries are the people’s university.” At the Cypress Park Branch Library not far from Dodger Stadium, the two most-circulated books are test preparation study guides for becoming a custodian. Many branches include “Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life.”

And at the Azusa Public Library, “Girl, Wash Your Face,” by Rachel Hollis, is beaten out only by the blockbuster memoirs “Educated,” by Tara Westover, and “Becoming.” Leila Hassen, the library services manager, said “Girl” is particularly popular with female patrons in their 20s and 30s.

“It’s definitely an empowering book, being kind to yourself and forgiving toward yourself,” Hassen said. “It’s a huge trend for our patrons. There’s a huge focus on wellness.”

And then there’s politics. In these polarizing times, when social media is filled with angry ranting about all things electoral, political books of all stripes are liberally sprinkled among library branches’ most-circulated books and those with the longest wait lists.

Want to read it? Get in line. “Becoming” by Michelle Obama (893 holds / 121 copies)

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens (547 holds / 64 copies)

“Educated: a Memoir” by Tara Westover (460 holds / 106 copies)

“The Library Book” by Susan Orlean (211 holds / 63 copies)

“Run Away” by Harlan Coben (181 holds / 60 copies)

“Dog Man: Brawl of the Wild” by Dav Pilkey (169 holds / 131 copies)

“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup” by John Carreyrou (155 holds / 21 copies)

“Becoming” [large print] by Michelle Obama (150 holds / 21 copies)

“Medical Medium Liver Rescue” by Anthony William (127 holds / 24 copies)

Race and gender, left and right, factual and conspiracy theorist, they’re all there. Beyond Woodward’s “Fear,” which is a hit at various branches, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House” by onetime Trump political aide Omarosa Manigault Newman came in at No. 4 at the Ascot Branch Library in South Los Angeles.

“Everything Trump Touches Dies,” by Republican strategist Rick Wilson is No. 10 at the Chatsworth Branch Library. Readers at the Junipero Serra Branch Library near USC were fond of “Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution,” in which Fox News star Tucker Carlson skewers politicians both red and blue.

Politically tinged fiction was also popular, including George Orwell’s “1984” and “Animal Farm,” Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, which envisions a dystopian world in which fertile women (a rarity) are forced to produce children for the male ruling class. (“Handmaids” dressed in red show up regularly at political protests these days.)

Members of Get Lit — A Los Angeles Book Club Meetup found serious political overtones in “Asymmetry,” a recent novel in three movements, by Lisa Halliday. The first section considers the relationship between Alice, a books editor in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a famous, aging novelist based on Philip Roth, whom Halliday dated back in the day.

Get Lit meets monthly on the second floor of the Original Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street in Los Angeles. Members range from their 20s on up, and their conversation floats above clinking plates, barking dogs, and other people’s chatter.

The politics that snagged these readers’ interest — and, often, annoyance — was gender-based through and through, a general acknowledgement of Blazer’s power and Alice’s subservience. Just listen:

Kristen Knox, a member for three years: “I kept praying for the guy to die so something would happen. She’s at his beck and call. If it were my friend, I’d slap her. ‘Oh, honey!’ ”

Alex Newman, “Asymmetry’s” rare defender: “To me, it never read as predatory. To me, he never did anything but give her money.”

Perhaps the most popular book across Los Angeles County was also political. And personal. And inspirational. And a little confessional. And political.

“Becoming,” which debuted in November, sold nearly 10 million copies in its first three months, according to Bloomberg, prompting Bertelsman Chief Executive Thomas Rabe to declare, “We believe this could become the most successful memoir ever.”

“Becoming,” by Michelle Obama, is perhaps the most popular title in libraries across Los Angeles County. If you want to check it out any time soon, be prepared to wait. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)

It appeared more times than any other among the three most popular books of all 200-plus branches surveyed.

It was the second-most-read book, systemwide, in the Los Angeles Public Library between January and March, behind Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night.”

“Becoming” had the longest waiting list of any book in the LA County Library. That system owns 121 copies. In the first quarter, 893 people placed a hold on Obama’s memoir, hoping to read it before the next election comes and goes.

If you want to borrow it, you’ll have to wait. And wait. And wait.

435,What's L.A. reading? Our habits are as diverse as the city itself,Michael Connelly,"Do you know what Los Angeles County is reading? The answers might surprise you.

Every Wednesday, a small group of dedicated book lovers huddles in a library conference room not far from Sawtelle Japantown. On this afternoon, the group is reading the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez.

In Farsi.

But first there is tea, a nod to Iranian culture and the homeland left behind by these patrons of the West Los Angeles Regional Library. The tea is hot and dark and strong, sipped with a sugar cube held between the teeth.

This is Los Angeles County, as seen through the books we read. It encompasses Monrovia, where the most-circulated works include “Becoming,” Michelle Obama’s wildly popular memoir, and “The Library Book.” Susan Orlean’s love letter to literacy is also the first selection of the Los Angeles Times Book Club.

And it includes Glendale, whose readers checked out Kazu Kibuishi’s manga blockbuster “Amulet” more than any other volume in the first three months of 2019.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)

As the Times launches its new community book group, we decided to find out what the county is reading — and, therefore, thinking about. We surveyed 35 library systems, asking which books were most circulated in the first quarter of 2019 and which ones have the longest waiting lists. Twenty-eight responded, representing more than 200 branches.

The lists of most-popular titles were collected from systems as small as Signal Hill’s, which has one branch and 11,000 patrons, and as massive as the County of Los Angeles network, which has 85 public branches and serves more than 3.4 million people. They paint a detailed, multicultural portrait of the region.

Most popular library books “Becoming” by Michelle Obama

“Dark Sacred Night” by Michael Connelly

“The Reckoning” by John Grisham

“Crazy Rich Asians” by Kevin Kwan

“Educated” by Tara Westover

“Long Road to Mercy” by David Baldacci

“Past Tense” by Lee Child

“The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens

The blockbusters are all there; as the most populous county in the United States, Los Angeles is a big part of what made them bestsellers in the first place. Think “Becoming” and Michael Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night,” John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” and Kevin Kwan’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

But the data also highlight the region’s unique neighborhoods, places whose singularity is written in the books residents hold dear. At the Mark Twain Branch Library, in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles, the three most circulated books are two anthologies of horror stories and the MacArthur Study Bible.

Patrons of Santa Monica’s Main Library routinely fly a liberal flag; their top choice is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” by Bob Woodward. Glendora’s most-read book was Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham.” Among the favorites countywide were volumes in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, French, Portuguese and Farsi.

So, why use libraries to investigate the books readers here love most?

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has.” — John Szabo, Los Angeles city librarian

Because, as Los Angeles city librarian John Szabo explains, “rich folks use our libraries. Folks without homes, who are homeless, aren’t just coming here for air conditioning. They’re reading and they’re using our services, and that’s important to remember.

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has,” he said. “Folks in rural Sunland-Tujunga, who have horses, make use of our libraries. We serve everybody.”

A Persian epic and Iranian tea

The West L.A. Library Farsi Reading Club meets in a second-floor conference room with scraped up, Band-Aid-colored walls. Every session starts with sweets, a poetry reading and tea.

The gathering, said librarian Ramin Naderi, is a Southern California reflection of life in Iran’s neighborhood teahouses, where performers called naghāls recite sections of the “Shahnameh,” an epic poem of pre-Islamic Persia that first appeared in the year 1010.

On this rainy Wednesday afternoon, Naderi reads the wistful “Recalling Youth Days” by contemporary poet Rahi Moayeri, which is projected on the wall in sinuous Arabic script: … My fate didn’t grant me grey-headedness for anything/For these white strands, my youth was paying. …

Because there are never enough copies of Farsi books to go around, members also read aloud from the book of the moment. This week is Chapter 10 of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which related in part the story of Remedios the Beauty and her great-grandmother, Úrsula Iguarán. Úrsula is the wise Buendía family matriarch, Remedios an innocent who wanders around naked.

Farsi Reading Club are tackling the Farsi version of the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by ‎Gabriel García Márquez. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Which sparks a debate between Max Rahani, 73, and Raheleh Olomy, a decade his junior, about politics and the role of women. In Farsi, of course.

This is Rahani’s post-meeting English-language recap:

Olomy: “Why blame Remedios? Without clothes, she has freedom.”

Rahani: “If a woman has ideas and is nude, it’s OK. Maybe they are protesting.… If [they] are nude without any idea behind that, it’s not OK.”

The West Los Angeles library’s 10 most-read books start with Obama’s “Becoming” and end with “Ābī ārām,” by Iranian author, Bahārah Bāqirī, known for her romance novels. That “Becoming” would make the area’s list of the most-circulated is a no-brainer. But the popularity of “Ābī ārām” tells us more about the neighborhood, about who lives and reads there.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library is one of five in the Los Angeles Public Library system that had Farsi books on its most-read list. Five of the top 10 books at the the West Valley branch were in Farsi, as were three of the top 10 at the Encino-Tarzana branch and the branch in Westwood, a.k.a. “Tehrangeles.” Sylmar’s best-read list included two.

Where Chinese lit and ‘Wimpy Kid’ top the list

There are so many superlatives when it comes to the population of Los Angeles County, and they all play out in the region’s libraries. It has more Iranians than any other county in the United States. Nearly 50% of the population is of Hispanic origin. The largest Chinese population of any county in the nation is here too.

At the Chinatown Branch Library, for example, the 10 most-requested books are all Chinese-language volumes. No surprise there. But the sole branch in pricey San Marino’s one-library system also lists Chinese-language books among its most circulated.

City Librarian Irene McDermott notes that the 2010 census showed 53% of residents identify as Asian in San Marino. That helps explain why three of the most-circulated adult books at the Crowell Public Library are in Chinese: “Stories of Lian Jiang,” “Love in Cold Palace” and “Struggles in the Palace.”

But if you look at all books, not just adult reading, the San Marino top 10 takes a dramatic shift. Yes, “Stories of Lian Jiang” and “Love in Cold Palace” still make the grade, at No. 3 and 4 most-circulated respectively. But all the rest of the books are for children, with “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” titles at spots No. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10.

“Oh, to be Jeff Kinney!” McDermott said, referring to the author who created beleaguered seventh-grader Greg Heffley, star of 13 Wimpy Kid books, with a 14th due in November, and four movies. When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

At the Santa Monica Public Library’s Pico Branch, the second and third most checked-out books are aimed at the short set. There’s “Geronimo Stilton,” an Italian series detailing the exploits of an adventurous mouse of the same name. And “Disney Fairies” — need we say more?

At the Santa Monica Public Library’s Pico Branch, the second and third most checked-out books are aimed at the short set. There’s “Geronimo Stilton,” an Italian series detailing the exploits of an adventurous mouse of the same name. And “Disney Fairies” — need we say more?

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended.” — Santa Monica director of library services Patty Wong

Patty Wong, Santa Monica director of library services, lauds the quality of children’s books, one reason she says they’re so popular. Not only do most have top-notch illustrations, but they’re “probably the strongest-edited of the materials out there.” They also have big crossover audiences.

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended,” she said. They also resonate with “early learners and English-language learners. When I was in Berkeley and doing a lot of work with non-English speakers, specifically Japanese … a lot of older Japanese speakers wanted to learn more about American culture through our children’s books.”

All about Michelle Obama’s journey — or your own

Self-help books make a big splash, in keeping with Szabo’s tenet that “libraries are the people’s university.” At the Cypress Park Branch Library not far from Dodger Stadium, the two most-circulated books are test preparation study guides for becoming a custodian. Many branches include “Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life.”

And at the Azusa Public Library, “Girl, Wash Your Face,” by Rachel Hollis, is beaten out only by the blockbuster memoirs “Educated,” by Tara Westover, and “Becoming.” Leila Hassen, the library services manager, said “Girl” is particularly popular with female patrons in their 20s and 30s.

“It’s definitely an empowering book, being kind to yourself and forgiving toward yourself,” Hassen said. “It’s a huge trend for our patrons. There’s a huge focus on wellness.”

And then there’s politics. In these polarizing times, when social media is filled with angry ranting about all things electoral, political books of all stripes are liberally sprinkled among library branches’ most-circulated books and those with the longest wait lists.

Want to read it? Get in line. “Becoming” by Michelle Obama (893 holds / 121 copies)

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens (547 holds / 64 copies)

“Educated: a Memoir” by Tara Westover (460 holds / 106 copies)

“The Library Book” by Susan Orlean (211 holds / 63 copies)

“Run Away” by Harlan Coben (181 holds / 60 copies)

“Dog Man: Brawl of the Wild” by Dav Pilkey (169 holds / 131 copies)

“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup” by John Carreyrou (155 holds / 21 copies)

“Becoming” [large print] by Michelle Obama (150 holds / 21 copies)

“Medical Medium Liver Rescue” by Anthony William (127 holds / 24 copies)

Race and gender, left and right, factual and conspiracy theorist, they’re all there. Beyond Woodward’s “Fear,” which is a hit at various branches, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House” by onetime Trump political aide Omarosa Manigault Newman came in at No. 4 at the Ascot Branch Library in South Los Angeles.

“Everything Trump Touches Dies,” by Republican strategist Rick Wilson is No. 10 at the Chatsworth Branch Library. Readers at the Junipero Serra Branch Library near USC were fond of “Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution,” in which Fox News star Tucker Carlson skewers politicians both red and blue.

Politically tinged fiction was also popular, including George Orwell’s “1984” and “Animal Farm,” Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, which envisions a dystopian world in which fertile women (a rarity) are forced to produce children for the male ruling class. (“Handmaids” dressed in red show up regularly at political protests these days.)

Members of Get Lit — A Los Angeles Book Club Meetup found serious political overtones in “Asymmetry,” a recent novel in three movements, by Lisa Halliday. The first section considers the relationship between Alice, a books editor in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a famous, aging novelist based on Philip Roth, whom Halliday dated back in the day.

Get Lit meets monthly on the second floor of the Original Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street in Los Angeles. Members range from their 20s on up, and their conversation floats above clinking plates, barking dogs, and other people’s chatter.

The politics that snagged these readers’ interest — and, often, annoyance — was gender-based through and through, a general acknowledgement of Blazer’s power and Alice’s subservience. Just listen:

Kristen Knox, a member for three years: “I kept praying for the guy to die so something would happen. She’s at his beck and call. If it were my friend, I’d slap her. ‘Oh, honey!’ ”

Alex Newman, “Asymmetry’s” rare defender: “To me, it never read as predatory. To me, he never did anything but give her money.”

Perhaps the most popular book across Los Angeles County was also political. And personal. And inspirational. And a little confessional. And political.

“Becoming,” which debuted in November, sold nearly 10 million copies in its first three months, according to Bloomberg, prompting Bertelsman Chief Executive Thomas Rabe to declare, “We believe this could become the most successful memoir ever.”

“Becoming,” by Michelle Obama, is perhaps the most popular title in libraries across Los Angeles County. If you want to check it out any time soon, be prepared to wait. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)

It appeared more times than any other among the three most popular books of all 200-plus branches surveyed.

It was the second-most-read book, systemwide, in the Los Angeles Public Library between January and March, behind Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night.”

“Becoming” had the longest waiting list of any book in the LA County Library. That system owns 121 copies. In the first quarter, 893 people placed a hold on Obama’s memoir, hoping to read it before the next election comes and goes.

If you want to borrow it, you’ll have to wait. And wait. And wait.

437,What's L.A. reading? Our habits are as diverse as the city itself,Kevin Kwan,"Do you know what Los Angeles County is reading? The answers might surprise you.

Every Wednesday, a small group of dedicated book lovers huddles in a library conference room not far from Sawtelle Japantown. On this afternoon, the group is reading the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez.

In Farsi.

But first there is tea, a nod to Iranian culture and the homeland left behind by these patrons of the West Los Angeles Regional Library. The tea is hot and dark and strong, sipped with a sugar cube held between the teeth.

This is Los Angeles County, as seen through the books we read. It encompasses Monrovia, where the most-circulated works include “Becoming,” Michelle Obama’s wildly popular memoir, and “The Library Book.” Susan Orlean’s love letter to literacy is also the first selection of the Los Angeles Times Book Club.

And it includes Glendale, whose readers checked out Kazu Kibuishi’s manga blockbuster “Amulet” more than any other volume in the first three months of 2019.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)

As the Times launches its new community book group, we decided to find out what the county is reading — and, therefore, thinking about. We surveyed 35 library systems, asking which books were most circulated in the first quarter of 2019 and which ones have the longest waiting lists. Twenty-eight responded, representing more than 200 branches.

The lists of most-popular titles were collected from systems as small as Signal Hill’s, which has one branch and 11,000 patrons, and as massive as the County of Los Angeles network, which has 85 public branches and serves more than 3.4 million people. They paint a detailed, multicultural portrait of the region.

Most popular library books “Becoming” by Michelle Obama

“Dark Sacred Night” by Michael Connelly

“The Reckoning” by John Grisham

“Crazy Rich Asians” by Kevin Kwan

“Educated” by Tara Westover

“Long Road to Mercy” by David Baldacci

“Past Tense” by Lee Child

“The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens

The blockbusters are all there; as the most populous county in the United States, Los Angeles is a big part of what made them bestsellers in the first place. Think “Becoming” and Michael Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night,” John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” and Kevin Kwan’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

But the data also highlight the region’s unique neighborhoods, places whose singularity is written in the books residents hold dear. At the Mark Twain Branch Library, in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles, the three most circulated books are two anthologies of horror stories and the MacArthur Study Bible.

Patrons of Santa Monica’s Main Library routinely fly a liberal flag; their top choice is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” by Bob Woodward. Glendora’s most-read book was Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham.” Among the favorites countywide were volumes in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, French, Portuguese and Farsi.

So, why use libraries to investigate the books readers here love most?

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has.” — John Szabo, Los Angeles city librarian

Because, as Los Angeles city librarian John Szabo explains, “rich folks use our libraries. Folks without homes, who are homeless, aren’t just coming here for air conditioning. They’re reading and they’re using our services, and that’s important to remember.

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has,” he said. “Folks in rural Sunland-Tujunga, who have horses, make use of our libraries. We serve everybody.”

A Persian epic and Iranian tea

The West L.A. Library Farsi Reading Club meets in a second-floor conference room with scraped up, Band-Aid-colored walls. Every session starts with sweets, a poetry reading and tea.

The gathering, said librarian Ramin Naderi, is a Southern California reflection of life in Iran’s neighborhood teahouses, where performers called naghāls recite sections of the “Shahnameh,” an epic poem of pre-Islamic Persia that first appeared in the year 1010.

On this rainy Wednesday afternoon, Naderi reads the wistful “Recalling Youth Days” by contemporary poet Rahi Moayeri, which is projected on the wall in sinuous Arabic script: … My fate didn’t grant me grey-headedness for anything/For these white strands, my youth was paying. …

Because there are never enough copies of Farsi books to go around, members also read aloud from the book of the moment. This week is Chapter 10 of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which related in part the story of Remedios the Beauty and her great-grandmother, Úrsula Iguarán. Úrsula is the wise Buendía family matriarch, Remedios an innocent who wanders around naked.

Farsi Reading Club are tackling the Farsi version of the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by ‎Gabriel García Márquez. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Which sparks a debate between Max Rahani, 73, and Raheleh Olomy, a decade his junior, about politics and the role of women. In Farsi, of course.

This is Rahani’s post-meeting English-language recap:

Olomy: “Why blame Remedios? Without clothes, she has freedom.”

Rahani: “If a woman has ideas and is nude, it’s OK. Maybe they are protesting.… If [they] are nude without any idea behind that, it’s not OK.”

The West Los Angeles library’s 10 most-read books start with Obama’s “Becoming” and end with “Ābī ārām,” by Iranian author, Bahārah Bāqirī, known for her romance novels. That “Becoming” would make the area’s list of the most-circulated is a no-brainer. But the popularity of “Ābī ārām” tells us more about the neighborhood, about who lives and reads there.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library is one of five in the Los Angeles Public Library system that had Farsi books on its most-read list. Five of the top 10 books at the the West Valley branch were in Farsi, as were three of the top 10 at the Encino-Tarzana branch and the branch in Westwood, a.k.a. “Tehrangeles.” Sylmar’s best-read list included two.

Where Chinese lit and ‘Wimpy Kid’ top the list

There are so many superlatives when it comes to the population of Los Angeles County, and they all play out in the region’s libraries. It has more Iranians than any other county in the United States. Nearly 50% of the population is of Hispanic origin. The largest Chinese population of any county in the nation is here too.

At the Chinatown Branch Library, for example, the 10 most-requested books are all Chinese-language volumes. No surprise there. But the sole branch in pricey San Marino’s one-library system also lists Chinese-language books among its most circulated.

City Librarian Irene McDermott notes that the 2010 census showed 53% of residents identify as Asian in San Marino. That helps explain why three of the most-circulated adult books at the Crowell Public Library are in Chinese: “Stories of Lian Jiang,” “Love in Cold Palace” and “Struggles in the Palace.”

But if you look at all books, not just adult reading, the San Marino top 10 takes a dramatic shift. Yes, “Stories of Lian Jiang” and “Love in Cold Palace” still make the grade, at No. 3 and 4 most-circulated respectively. But all the rest of the books are for children, with “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” titles at spots No. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10.

“Oh, to be Jeff Kinney!” McDermott said, referring to the author who created beleaguered seventh-grader Greg Heffley, star of 13 Wimpy Kid books, with a 14th due in November, and four movies. When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

At the Santa Monica Public Library’s Pico Branch, the second and third most checked-out books are aimed at the short set. There’s “Geronimo Stilton,” an Italian series detailing the exploits of an adventurous mouse of the same name. And “Disney Fairies” — need we say more?

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended.” — Santa Monica director of library services Patty Wong

Patty Wong, Santa Monica director of library services, lauds the quality of children’s books, one reason she says they’re so popular. Not only do most have top-notch illustrations, but they’re “probably the strongest-edited of the materials out there.” They also have big crossover audiences.

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended,” she said. They also resonate with “early learners and English-language learners. When I was in Berkeley and doing a lot of work with non-English speakers, specifically Japanese … a lot of older Japanese speakers wanted to learn more about American culture through our children’s books.”

All about Michelle Obama’s journey — or your own

Self-help books make a big splash, in keeping with Szabo’s tenet that “libraries are the people’s university.” At the Cypress Park Branch Library not far from Dodger Stadium, the two most-circulated books are test preparation study guides for becoming a custodian. Many branches include “Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life.”

And at the Azusa Public Library, “Girl, Wash Your Face,” by Rachel Hollis, is beaten out only by the blockbuster memoirs “Educated,” by Tara Westover, and “Becoming.” Leila Hassen, the library services manager, said “Girl” is particularly popular with female patrons in their 20s and 30s.

“It’s definitely an empowering book, being kind to yourself and forgiving toward yourself,” Hassen said. “It’s a huge trend for our patrons. There’s a huge focus on wellness.”

And then there’s politics. In these polarizing times, when social media is filled with angry ranting about all things electoral, political books of all stripes are liberally sprinkled among library branches’ most-circulated books and those with the longest wait lists.

Want to read it? Get in line. “Becoming” by Michelle Obama (893 holds / 121 copies)

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens (547 holds / 64 copies)

“Educated: a Memoir” by Tara Westover (460 holds / 106 copies)

“The Library Book” by Susan Orlean (211 holds / 63 copies)

“Run Away” by Harlan Coben (181 holds / 60 copies)

“Dog Man: Brawl of the Wild” by Dav Pilkey (169 holds / 131 copies)

“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup” by John Carreyrou (155 holds / 21 copies)

“Becoming” [large print] by Michelle Obama (150 holds / 21 copies)

“Medical Medium Liver Rescue” by Anthony William (127 holds / 24 copies)

Race and gender, left and right, factual and conspiracy theorist, they’re all there. Beyond Woodward’s “Fear,” which is a hit at various branches, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House” by onetime Trump political aide Omarosa Manigault Newman came in at No. 4 at the Ascot Branch Library in South Los Angeles.

“Everything Trump Touches Dies,” by Republican strategist Rick Wilson is No. 10 at the Chatsworth Branch Library. Readers at the Junipero Serra Branch Library near USC were fond of “Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution,” in which Fox News star Tucker Carlson skewers politicians both red and blue.

Politically tinged fiction was also popular, including George Orwell’s “1984” and “Animal Farm,” Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, which envisions a dystopian world in which fertile women (a rarity) are forced to produce children for the male ruling class. (“Handmaids” dressed in red show up regularly at political protests these days.)

Members of Get Lit — A Los Angeles Book Club Meetup found serious political overtones in “Asymmetry,” a recent novel in three movements, by Lisa Halliday. The first section considers the relationship between Alice, a books editor in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a famous, aging novelist based on Philip Roth, whom Halliday dated back in the day.

Get Lit meets monthly on the second floor of the Original Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street in Los Angeles. Members range from their 20s on up, and their conversation floats above clinking plates, barking dogs, and other people’s chatter.

The politics that snagged these readers’ interest — and, often, annoyance — was gender-based through and through, a general acknowledgement of Blazer’s power and Alice’s subservience. Just listen:

Kristen Knox, a member for three years: “I kept praying for the guy to die so something would happen. She’s at his beck and call. If it were my friend, I’d slap her. ‘Oh, honey!’ ”

Alex Newman, “Asymmetry’s” rare defender: “To me, it never read as predatory. To me, he never did anything but give her money.”

Perhaps the most popular book across Los Angeles County was also political. And personal. And inspirational. And a little confessional. And political.

“Becoming,” which debuted in November, sold nearly 10 million copies in its first three months, according to Bloomberg, prompting Bertelsman Chief Executive Thomas Rabe to declare, “We believe this could become the most successful memoir ever.”

“Becoming,” by Michelle Obama, is perhaps the most popular title in libraries across Los Angeles County. If you want to check it out any time soon, be prepared to wait. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)

It appeared more times than any other among the three most popular books of all 200-plus branches surveyed.

It was the second-most-read book, systemwide, in the Los Angeles Public Library between January and March, behind Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night.”

“Becoming” had the longest waiting list of any book in the LA County Library. That system owns 121 copies. In the first quarter, 893 people placed a hold on Obama’s memoir, hoping to read it before the next election comes and goes.

If you want to borrow it, you’ll have to wait. And wait. And wait.

439,What's L.A. reading? Our habits are as diverse as the city itself,David Baldacci,"Do you know what Los Angeles County is reading? The answers might surprise you.

Every Wednesday, a small group of dedicated book lovers huddles in a library conference room not far from Sawtelle Japantown. On this afternoon, the group is reading the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez.

In Farsi.

But first there is tea, a nod to Iranian culture and the homeland left behind by these patrons of the West Los Angeles Regional Library. The tea is hot and dark and strong, sipped with a sugar cube held between the teeth.

This is Los Angeles County, as seen through the books we read. It encompasses Monrovia, where the most-circulated works include “Becoming,” Michelle Obama’s wildly popular memoir, and “The Library Book.” Susan Orlean’s love letter to literacy is also the first selection of the Los Angeles Times Book Club.

And it includes Glendale, whose readers checked out Kazu Kibuishi’s manga blockbuster “Amulet” more than any other volume in the first three months of 2019.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)

As the Times launches its new community book group, we decided to find out what the county is reading — and, therefore, thinking about. We surveyed 35 library systems, asking which books were most circulated in the first quarter of 2019 and which ones have the longest waiting lists. Twenty-eight responded, representing more than 200 branches.

The lists of most-popular titles were collected from systems as small as Signal Hill’s, which has one branch and 11,000 patrons, and as massive as the County of Los Angeles network, which has 85 public branches and serves more than 3.4 million people. They paint a detailed, multicultural portrait of the region.

Most popular library books “Becoming” by Michelle Obama

“Dark Sacred Night” by Michael Connelly

“The Reckoning” by John Grisham

“Crazy Rich Asians” by Kevin Kwan

“Educated” by Tara Westover

“Long Road to Mercy” by David Baldacci

“Past Tense” by Lee Child

“The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens

The blockbusters are all there; as the most populous county in the United States, Los Angeles is a big part of what made them bestsellers in the first place. Think “Becoming” and Michael Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night,” John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” and Kevin Kwan’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

But the data also highlight the region’s unique neighborhoods, places whose singularity is written in the books residents hold dear. At the Mark Twain Branch Library, in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles, the three most circulated books are two anthologies of horror stories and the MacArthur Study Bible.

Patrons of Santa Monica’s Main Library routinely fly a liberal flag; their top choice is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” by Bob Woodward. Glendora’s most-read book was Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham.” Among the favorites countywide were volumes in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, French, Portuguese and Farsi.

So, why use libraries to investigate the books readers here love most?

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has.” — John Szabo, Los Angeles city librarian

Because, as Los Angeles city librarian John Szabo explains, “rich folks use our libraries. Folks without homes, who are homeless, aren’t just coming here for air conditioning. They’re reading and they’re using our services, and that’s important to remember.

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has,” he said. “Folks in rural Sunland-Tujunga, who have horses, make use of our libraries. We serve everybody.”

A Persian epic and Iranian tea

The West L.A. Library Farsi Reading Club meets in a second-floor conference room with scraped up, Band-Aid-colored walls. Every session starts with sweets, a poetry reading and tea.

The gathering, said librarian Ramin Naderi, is a Southern California reflection of life in Iran’s neighborhood teahouses, where performers called naghāls recite sections of the “Shahnameh,” an epic poem of pre-Islamic Persia that first appeared in the year 1010.

On this rainy Wednesday afternoon, Naderi reads the wistful “Recalling Youth Days” by contemporary poet Rahi Moayeri, which is projected on the wall in sinuous Arabic script: … My fate didn’t grant me grey-headedness for anything/For these white strands, my youth was paying. …

Because there are never enough copies of Farsi books to go around, members also read aloud from the book of the moment. This week is Chapter 10 of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which related in part the story of Remedios the Beauty and her great-grandmother, Úrsula Iguarán. Úrsula is the wise Buendía family matriarch, Remedios an innocent who wanders around naked.

Farsi Reading Club are tackling the Farsi version of the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by ‎Gabriel García Márquez. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Which sparks a debate between Max Rahani, 73, and Raheleh Olomy, a decade his junior, about politics and the role of women. In Farsi, of course.

This is Rahani’s post-meeting English-language recap:

Olomy: “Why blame Remedios? Without clothes, she has freedom.”

Rahani: “If a woman has ideas and is nude, it’s OK. Maybe they are protesting.… If [they] are nude without any idea behind that, it’s not OK.”

The West Los Angeles library’s 10 most-read books start with Obama’s “Becoming” and end with “Ābī ārām,” by Iranian author, Bahārah Bāqirī, known for her romance novels. That “Becoming” would make the area’s list of the most-circulated is a no-brainer. But the popularity of “Ābī ārām” tells us more about the neighborhood, about who lives and reads there.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library is one of five in the Los Angeles Public Library system that had Farsi books on its most-read list. Five of the top 10 books at the the West Valley branch were in Farsi, as were three of the top 10 at the Encino-Tarzana branch and the branch in Westwood, a.k.a. “Tehrangeles.” Sylmar’s best-read list included two.

Where Chinese lit and ‘Wimpy Kid’ top the list

There are so many superlatives when it comes to the population of Los Angeles County, and they all play out in the region’s libraries. It has more Iranians than any other county in the United States. Nearly 50% of the population is of Hispanic origin. The largest Chinese population of any county in the nation is here too.

At the Chinatown Branch Library, for example, the 10 most-requested books are all Chinese-language volumes. No surprise there. But the sole branch in pricey San Marino’s one-library system also lists Chinese-language books among its most circulated.

City Librarian Irene McDermott notes that the 2010 census showed 53% of residents identify as Asian in San Marino. That helps explain why three of the most-circulated adult books at the Crowell Public Library are in Chinese: “Stories of Lian Jiang,” “Love in Cold Palace” and “Struggles in the Palace.”

But if you look at all books, not just adult reading, the San Marino top 10 takes a dramatic shift. Yes, “Stories of Lian Jiang” and “Love in Cold Palace” still make the grade, at No. 3 and 4 most-circulated respectively. But all the rest of the books are for children, with “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” titles at spots No. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10.

“Oh, to be Jeff Kinney!” McDermott said, referring to the author who created beleaguered seventh-grader Greg Heffley, star of 13 Wimpy Kid books, with a 14th due in November, and four movies. When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

At the Santa Monica Public Library’s Pico Branch, the second and third most checked-out books are aimed at the short set. There’s “Geronimo Stilton,” an Italian series detailing the exploits of an adventurous mouse of the same name. And “Disney Fairies” — need we say more?

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended.” — Santa Monica director of library services Patty Wong

Patty Wong, Santa Monica director of library services, lauds the quality of children’s books, one reason she says they’re so popular. Not only do most have top-notch illustrations, but they’re “probably the strongest-edited of the materials out there.” They also have big crossover audiences.

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended,” she said. They also resonate with “early learners and English-language learners. When I was in Berkeley and doing a lot of work with non-English speakers, specifically Japanese … a lot of older Japanese speakers wanted to learn more about American culture through our children’s books.”

All about Michelle Obama’s journey — or your own

Self-help books make a big splash, in keeping with Szabo’s tenet that “libraries are the people’s university.” At the Cypress Park Branch Library not far from Dodger Stadium, the two most-circulated books are test preparation study guides for becoming a custodian. Many branches include “Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life.”

And at the Azusa Public Library, “Girl, Wash Your Face,” by Rachel Hollis, is beaten out only by the blockbuster memoirs “Educated,” by Tara Westover, and “Becoming.” Leila Hassen, the library services manager, said “Girl” is particularly popular with female patrons in their 20s and 30s.

“It’s definitely an empowering book, being kind to yourself and forgiving toward yourself,” Hassen said. “It’s a huge trend for our patrons. There’s a huge focus on wellness.”

And then there’s politics. In these polarizing times, when social media is filled with angry ranting about all things electoral, political books of all stripes are liberally sprinkled among library branches’ most-circulated books and those with the longest wait lists.

Want to read it? Get in line. “Becoming” by Michelle Obama (893 holds / 121 copies)

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens (547 holds / 64 copies)

“Educated: a Memoir” by Tara Westover (460 holds / 106 copies)

“The Library Book” by Susan Orlean (211 holds / 63 copies)

“Run Away” by Harlan Coben (181 holds / 60 copies)

“Dog Man: Brawl of the Wild” by Dav Pilkey (169 holds / 131 copies)

“Becoming” [large print] by Michelle Obama (150 holds / 21 copies)

“Medical Medium Liver Rescue” by Anthony William (127 holds / 24 copies)

Race and gender, left and right, factual and conspiracy theorist, they’re all there. Beyond Woodward’s “Fear,” which is a hit at various branches, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House” by onetime Trump political aide Omarosa Manigault Newman came in at No. 4 at the Ascot Branch Library in South Los Angeles.

“Everything Trump Touches Dies,” by Republican strategist Rick Wilson is No. 10 at the Chatsworth Branch Library. Readers at the Junipero Serra Branch Library near USC were fond of “Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution,” in which Fox News star Tucker Carlson skewers politicians both red and blue.

Politically tinged fiction was also popular, including George Orwell’s “1984” and “Animal Farm,” Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, which envisions a dystopian world in which fertile women (a rarity) are forced to produce children for the male ruling class. (“Handmaids” dressed in red show up regularly at political protests these days.)

Members of Get Lit — A Los Angeles Book Club Meetup found serious political overtones in “Asymmetry,” a recent novel in three movements, by Lisa Halliday. The first section considers the relationship between Alice, a books editor in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a famous, aging novelist based on Philip Roth, whom Halliday dated back in the day.

Get Lit meets monthly on the second floor of the Original Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street in Los Angeles. Members range from their 20s on up, and their conversation floats above clinking plates, barking dogs, and other people’s chatter.

The politics that snagged these readers’ interest — and, often, annoyance — was gender-based through and through, a general acknowledgement of Blazer’s power and Alice’s subservience. Just listen:

Kristen Knox, a member for three years: “I kept praying for the guy to die so something would happen. She’s at his beck and call. If it were my friend, I’d slap her. ‘Oh, honey!’ ”

Alex Newman, “Asymmetry’s” rare defender: “To me, it never read as predatory. To me, he never did anything but give her money.”

Perhaps the most popular book across Los Angeles County was also political. And personal. And inspirational. And a little confessional. And political.

“Becoming,” which debuted in November, sold nearly 10 million copies in its first three months, according to Bloomberg, prompting Bertelsman Chief Executive Thomas Rabe to declare, “We believe this could become the most successful memoir ever.”

“Becoming,” by Michelle Obama, is perhaps the most popular title in libraries across Los Angeles County. If you want to check it out any time soon, be prepared to wait. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)

It appeared more times than any other among the three most popular books of all 200-plus branches surveyed.

It was the second-most-read book, systemwide, in the Los Angeles Public Library between January and March, behind Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night.”

“Becoming” had the longest waiting list of any book in the LA County Library. That system owns 121 copies. In the first quarter, 893 people placed a hold on Obama’s memoir, hoping to read it before the next election comes and goes.

If you want to borrow it, you’ll have to wait. And wait. And wait.

441,What's L.A. reading? Our habits are as diverse as the city itself,Paulo Coehlo,"Do you know what Los Angeles County is reading? The answers might surprise you.

Every Wednesday, a small group of dedicated book lovers huddles in a library conference room not far from Sawtelle Japantown. On this afternoon, the group is reading the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez.

In Farsi.

But first there is tea, a nod to Iranian culture and the homeland left behind by these patrons of the West Los Angeles Regional Library. The tea is hot and dark and strong, sipped with a sugar cube held between the teeth.

This is Los Angeles County, as seen through the books we read. It encompasses Monrovia, where the most-circulated works include “Becoming,” Michelle Obama’s wildly popular memoir, and “The Library Book.” Susan Orlean’s love letter to literacy is also the first selection of the Los Angeles Times Book Club.

And it includes Glendale, whose readers checked out Kazu Kibuishi’s manga blockbuster “Amulet” more than any other volume in the first three months of 2019.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)

As the Times launches its new community book group, we decided to find out what the county is reading — and, therefore, thinking about. We surveyed 35 library systems, asking which books were most circulated in the first quarter of 2019 and which ones have the longest waiting lists. Twenty-eight responded, representing more than 200 branches.

The lists of most-popular titles were collected from systems as small as Signal Hill’s, which has one branch and 11,000 patrons, and as massive as the County of Los Angeles network, which has 85 public branches and serves more than 3.4 million people. They paint a detailed, multicultural portrait of the region.

Most popular library books “Becoming” by Michelle Obama

“Dark Sacred Night” by Michael Connelly

“The Reckoning” by John Grisham

“Crazy Rich Asians” by Kevin Kwan

“Educated” by Tara Westover

“Long Road to Mercy” by David Baldacci

“Past Tense” by Lee Child

“The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens

The blockbusters are all there; as the most populous county in the United States, Los Angeles is a big part of what made them bestsellers in the first place. Think “Becoming” and Michael Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night,” John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” and Kevin Kwan’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

But the data also highlight the region’s unique neighborhoods, places whose singularity is written in the books residents hold dear. At the Mark Twain Branch Library, in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles, the three most circulated books are two anthologies of horror stories and the MacArthur Study Bible.

Patrons of Santa Monica’s Main Library routinely fly a liberal flag; their top choice is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” by Bob Woodward. Glendora’s most-read book was Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham.” Among the favorites countywide were volumes in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, French, Portuguese and Farsi.

So, why use libraries to investigate the books readers here love most?

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has.” — John Szabo, Los Angeles city librarian

Because, as Los Angeles city librarian John Szabo explains, “rich folks use our libraries. Folks without homes, who are homeless, aren’t just coming here for air conditioning. They’re reading and they’re using our services, and that’s important to remember.

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has,” he said. “Folks in rural Sunland-Tujunga, who have horses, make use of our libraries. We serve everybody.”

A Persian epic and Iranian tea

The West L.A. Library Farsi Reading Club meets in a second-floor conference room with scraped up, Band-Aid-colored walls. Every session starts with sweets, a poetry reading and tea.

The gathering, said librarian Ramin Naderi, is a Southern California reflection of life in Iran’s neighborhood teahouses, where performers called naghāls recite sections of the “Shahnameh,” an epic poem of pre-Islamic Persia that first appeared in the year 1010.

On this rainy Wednesday afternoon, Naderi reads the wistful “Recalling Youth Days” by contemporary poet Rahi Moayeri, which is projected on the wall in sinuous Arabic script: … My fate didn’t grant me grey-headedness for anything/For these white strands, my youth was paying. …

Because there are never enough copies of Farsi books to go around, members also read aloud from the book of the moment. This week is Chapter 10 of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which related in part the story of Remedios the Beauty and her great-grandmother, Úrsula Iguarán. Úrsula is the wise Buendía family matriarch, Remedios an innocent who wanders around naked.

Farsi Reading Club are tackling the Farsi version of the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by ‎Gabriel García Márquez. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Which sparks a debate between Max Rahani, 73, and Raheleh Olomy, a decade his junior, about politics and the role of women. In Farsi, of course.

This is Rahani’s post-meeting English-language recap:

Olomy: “Why blame Remedios? Without clothes, she has freedom.”

Rahani: “If a woman has ideas and is nude, it’s OK. Maybe they are protesting.… If [they] are nude without any idea behind that, it’s not OK.”

The West Los Angeles library’s 10 most-read books start with Obama’s “Becoming” and end with “Ābī ārām,” by Iranian author, Bahārah Bāqirī, known for her romance novels. That “Becoming” would make the area’s list of the most-circulated is a no-brainer. But the popularity of “Ābī ārām” tells us more about the neighborhood, about who lives and reads there.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library is one of five in the Los Angeles Public Library system that had Farsi books on its most-read list. Five of the top 10 books at the the West Valley branch were in Farsi, as were three of the top 10 at the Encino-Tarzana branch and the branch in Westwood, a.k.a. “Tehrangeles.” Sylmar’s best-read list included two.

Where Chinese lit and ‘Wimpy Kid’ top the list

There are so many superlatives when it comes to the population of Los Angeles County, and they all play out in the region’s libraries. It has more Iranians than any other county in the United States. Nearly 50% of the population is of Hispanic origin. The largest Chinese population of any county in the nation is here too.

At the Chinatown Branch Library, for example, the 10 most-requested books are all Chinese-language volumes. No surprise there. But the sole branch in pricey San Marino’s one-library system also lists Chinese-language books among its most circulated.

City Librarian Irene McDermott notes that the 2010 census showed 53% of residents identify as Asian in San Marino. That helps explain why three of the most-circulated adult books at the Crowell Public Library are in Chinese: “Stories of Lian Jiang,” “Love in Cold Palace” and “Struggles in the Palace.”

But if you look at all books, not just adult reading, the San Marino top 10 takes a dramatic shift. Yes, “Stories of Lian Jiang” and “Love in Cold Palace” still make the grade, at No. 3 and 4 most-circulated respectively. But all the rest of the books are for children, with “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” titles at spots No. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10.

“Oh, to be Jeff Kinney!” McDermott said, referring to the author who created beleaguered seventh-grader Greg Heffley, star of 13 Wimpy Kid books, with a 14th due in November, and four movies. When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

At the Santa Monica Public Library’s Pico Branch, the second and third most checked-out books are aimed at the short set. There’s “Geronimo Stilton,” an Italian series detailing the exploits of an adventurous mouse of the same name. And “Disney Fairies” — need we say more?

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended.” — Santa Monica director of library services Patty Wong

Patty Wong, Santa Monica director of library services, lauds the quality of children’s books, one reason she says they’re so popular. Not only do most have top-notch illustrations, but they’re “probably the strongest-edited of the materials out there.” They also have big crossover audiences.

“Our children’s materials don’t only speak well to the children for whom they’re intended,” she said. They also resonate with “early learners and English-language learners. When I was in Berkeley and doing a lot of work with non-English speakers, specifically Japanese … a lot of older Japanese speakers wanted to learn more about American culture through our children’s books.”

All about Michelle Obama’s journey — or your own

Self-help books make a big splash, in keeping with Szabo’s tenet that “libraries are the people’s university.” At the Cypress Park Branch Library not far from Dodger Stadium, the two most-circulated books are test preparation study guides for becoming a custodian. Many branches include “Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life.”

And at the Azusa Public Library, “Girl, Wash Your Face,” by Rachel Hollis, is beaten out only by the blockbuster memoirs “Educated,” by Tara Westover, and “Becoming.” Leila Hassen, the library services manager, said “Girl” is particularly popular with female patrons in their 20s and 30s.

“It’s definitely an empowering book, being kind to yourself and forgiving toward yourself,” Hassen said. “It’s a huge trend for our patrons. There’s a huge focus on wellness.”

And then there’s politics. In these polarizing times, when social media is filled with angry ranting about all things electoral, political books of all stripes are liberally sprinkled among library branches’ most-circulated books and those with the longest wait lists.

Want to read it? Get in line. “Becoming” by Michelle Obama (893 holds / 121 copies)

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens (547 holds / 64 copies)

“Educated: a Memoir” by Tara Westover (460 holds / 106 copies)

“The Library Book” by Susan Orlean (211 holds / 63 copies)

“Run Away” by Harlan Coben (181 holds / 60 copies)

“Dog Man: Brawl of the Wild” by Dav Pilkey (169 holds / 131 copies)

“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup” by John Carreyrou (155 holds / 21 copies)

“Becoming” [large print] by Michelle Obama (150 holds / 21 copies)

“Medical Medium Liver Rescue” by Anthony William (127 holds / 24 copies)

Race and gender, left and right, factual and conspiracy theorist, they’re all there. Beyond Woodward’s “Fear,” which is a hit at various branches, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House” by onetime Trump political aide Omarosa Manigault Newman came in at No. 4 at the Ascot Branch Library in South Los Angeles.

“Everything Trump Touches Dies,” by Republican strategist Rick Wilson is No. 10 at the Chatsworth Branch Library. Readers at the Junipero Serra Branch Library near USC were fond of “Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution,” in which Fox News star Tucker Carlson skewers politicians both red and blue.

Politically tinged fiction was also popular, including George Orwell’s “1984” and “Animal Farm,” Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, which envisions a dystopian world in which fertile women (a rarity) are forced to produce children for the male ruling class. (“Handmaids” dressed in red show up regularly at political protests these days.)

Members of Get Lit — A Los Angeles Book Club Meetup found serious political overtones in “Asymmetry,” a recent novel in three movements, by Lisa Halliday. The first section considers the relationship between Alice, a books editor in her mid-20s, and Ezra Blazer, a famous, aging novelist based on Philip Roth, whom Halliday dated back in the day.

Get Lit meets monthly on the second floor of the Original Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street in Los Angeles. Members range from their 20s on up, and their conversation floats above clinking plates, barking dogs, and other people’s chatter.

The politics that snagged these readers’ interest — and, often, annoyance — was gender-based through and through, a general acknowledgement of Blazer’s power and Alice’s subservience. Just listen:

Kristen Knox, a member for three years: “I kept praying for the guy to die so something would happen. She’s at his beck and call. If it were my friend, I’d slap her. ‘Oh, honey!’ ”

Alex Newman, “Asymmetry’s” rare defender: “To me, it never read as predatory. To me, he never did anything but give her money.”

Perhaps the most popular book across Los Angeles County was also political. And personal. And inspirational. And a little confessional. And political.

“Becoming,” which debuted in November, sold nearly 10 million copies in its first three months, according to Bloomberg, prompting Bertelsman Chief Executive Thomas Rabe to declare, “We believe this could become the most successful memoir ever.”

“Becoming,” by Michelle Obama, is perhaps the most popular title in libraries across Los Angeles County. If you want to check it out any time soon, be prepared to wait. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)

It appeared more times than any other among the three most popular books of all 200-plus branches surveyed.

It was the second-most-read book, systemwide, in the Los Angeles Public Library between January and March, behind Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night.”

“Becoming” had the longest waiting list of any book in the LA County Library. That system owns 121 copies. In the first quarter, 893 people placed a hold on Obama’s memoir, hoping to read it before the next election comes and goes.

If you want to borrow it, you’ll have to wait. And wait. And wait.

443,What's L.A. reading? Our habits are as diverse as the city itself,Holds,"Do you know what Los Angeles County is reading? The answers might surprise you.

Every Wednesday, a small group of dedicated book lovers huddles in a library conference room not far from Sawtelle Japantown. On this afternoon, the group is reading the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez.

In Farsi.

But first there is tea, a nod to Iranian culture and the homeland left behind by these patrons of the West Los Angeles Regional Library. The tea is hot and dark and strong, sipped with a sugar cube held between the teeth.

This is Los Angeles County, as seen through the books we read. It encompasses Monrovia, where the most-circulated works include “Becoming,” Michelle Obama’s wildly popular memoir, and “The Library Book.” Susan Orlean’s love letter to literacy is also the first selection of the Los Angeles Times Book Club.

And it includes Glendale, whose readers checked out Kazu Kibuishi’s manga blockbuster “Amulet” more than any other volume in the first three months of 2019.

Author Susan Orlean is seen in the Los Angeles Central Library’s second-floor rotunda. Orlean wrote “The Library Book,” which tells of the 1986 fire that swept through the Central Library and is one of the most frequently requested books at libraries in Los Angeles County. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)

As the Times launches its new community book group, we decided to find out what the county is reading — and, therefore, thinking about. We surveyed 35 library systems, asking which books were most circulated in the first quarter of 2019 and which ones have the longest waiting lists. Twenty-eight responded, representing more than 200 branches.

The lists of most-popular titles were collected from systems as small as Signal Hill’s, which has one branch and 11,000 patrons, and as massive as the County of Los Angeles network, which has 85 public branches and serves more than 3.4 million people. They paint a detailed, multicultural portrait of the region.

Most popular library books “Becoming” by Michelle Obama

“Dark Sacred Night” by Michael Connelly

“The Reckoning” by John Grisham

“Crazy Rich Asians” by Kevin Kwan

“Educated” by Tara Westover

“Long Road to Mercy” by David Baldacci

“Past Tense” by Lee Child

“The Alchemist” by Paulo Coehlo

“Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens

The blockbusters are all there; as the most populous county in the United States, Los Angeles is a big part of what made them bestsellers in the first place. Think “Becoming” and Michael Connelly’s “Dark Sacred Night,” John Grisham’s “The Reckoning” and Kevin Kwan’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

But the data also highlight the region’s unique neighborhoods, places whose singularity is written in the books residents hold dear. At the Mark Twain Branch Library, in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles, the three most circulated books are two anthologies of horror stories and the MacArthur Study Bible.

Patrons of Santa Monica’s Main Library routinely fly a liberal flag; their top choice is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” by Bob Woodward. Glendora’s most-read book was Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham.” Among the favorites countywide were volumes in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, French, Portuguese and Farsi.

So, why use libraries to investigate the books readers here love most?

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has.” — John Szabo, Los Angeles city librarian

Because, as Los Angeles city librarian John Szabo explains, “rich folks use our libraries. Folks without homes, who are homeless, aren’t just coming here for air conditioning. They’re reading and they’re using our services, and that’s important to remember.

“Undocumented residents of L.A. are making use of our libraries and have the same rights and privileges in our library that anybody else has,” he said. “Folks in rural Sunland-Tujunga, who have horses, make use of our libraries. We serve everybody.”

A Persian epic and Iranian tea

The West L.A. Library Farsi Reading Club meets in a second-floor conference room with scraped up, Band-Aid-colored walls. Every session starts with sweets, a poetry reading and tea.

The gathering, said librarian Ramin Naderi, is a Southern California reflection of life in Iran’s neighborhood teahouses, where performers called naghāls recite sections of the “Shahnameh,” an epic poem of pre-Islamic Persia that first appeared in the year 1010.

On this rainy Wednesday afternoon, Naderi reads the wistful “Recalling Youth Days” by contemporary poet Rahi Moayeri, which is projected on the wall in sinuous Arabic script: … My fate didn’t grant me grey-headedness for anything/For these white strands, my youth was paying. …

Because there are never enough copies of Farsi books to go around, members also read aloud from the book of the moment. This week is Chapter 10 of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” which related in part the story of Remedios the Beauty and her great-grandmother, Úrsula Iguarán. Úrsula is the wise Buendía family matriarch, Remedios an innocent who wanders around naked.

Farsi Reading Club are tackling the Farsi version of the Latin American classic “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by ‎Gabriel García Márquez. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)

Which sparks a debate between Max Rahani, 73, and Raheleh Olomy, a decade his junior, about politics and the role of women. In Farsi, of course.

This is Rahani’s post-meeting English-language recap:

Olomy: “Why blame Remedios? Without clothes, she has freedom.”

Rahani: “If a woman has ideas and is nude, it’s OK. Maybe they are protesting.… If [they] are nude without any idea behind that, it’s not OK.”

The West Los Angeles library’s 10 most-read books start with Obama’s “Becoming” and end with “Ābī ārām,” by Iranian author, Bahārah Bāqirī, known for her romance novels. That “Becoming” would make the area’s list of the most-circulated is a no-brainer. But the popularity of “Ābī ārām” tells us more about the neighborhood, about who lives and reads there.

The West Los Angeles Regional Library is one of five in the Los Angeles Public Library system that had Farsi books on its most-read list. Five of the top 10 books at the the West Valley branch were in Farsi, as were three of the top 10 at the Encino-Tarzana branch and the branch in Westwood, a.k.a. “Tehrangeles.” Sylmar’s best-read list included two.

Where Chinese lit and ‘Wimpy Kid’ top the list

There are so many superlatives when it comes to the population of Los Angeles County, and they all play out in the region’s libraries. It has more Iranians than any other county in the United States. Nearly 50% of the population is of Hispanic origin. The largest Chinese population of any county in the nation is here too.

At the Chinatown Branch Library, for example, the 10 most-requested books are all Chinese-language volumes. No surprise there. But the sole branch in pricey San Marino’s one-library system also lists Chinese-language books among its most circulated.

City Librarian Irene McDermott notes that the 2010 census showed 53% of residents identify as Asian in San Marino. That helps explain why three of the most-circulated adult books at the Crowell Public Library are in Chinese: “Stories of Lian Jiang,” “Love in Cold Palace” and “Struggles in the Palace.”

But if you look at all books, not just adult reading, the San Marino top 10 takes a dramatic shift. Yes, “Stories of Lian Jiang” and “Love in Cold Palace” still make the grade, at No. 3 and 4 most-circulated respectively. But all the rest of the books are for children, with “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” titles at spots No. 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10.

“Oh, to be Jeff Kinney!” McDermott said, referring to the author who created beleaguered seventh-grader Greg Heffley, star of 13 Wimpy Kid books, with a 14th due in November, and four movies. When Greg’s first miserable week in middle school ended, he wrote in his journal (Do NOT call it a diary!) that “the only reason I get out of bed on weekends is because, eventually I can’t stand the taste of my breath anymore.”

584,Racing! Jon White’s final Belmont Stakes rankings,John Cherwa,"Hello, my name is John Cherwa and welcome to our horse racing newsletter as we head into Belmont weekend.

A little news before we get to the good stuff.

--Santa Anita suffers its 27th death since the meeting started on Dec. 26. Just click here.

--The topic at Belmont is all about horse safety and welfare. Just click here.

Jon White’s Belmont rankings

The Belmont Stakes is here and we’ve got Jon White ready to share his insights. Jon makes the morning line at Santa Anita, he’s a licensed steward, and he’s the pre-eminent historian on racing. We’re lucky to have him. So, here it is, the final rankings of the final leg of the Triple Crown , courtesy of Xpressbet.com. Jon, the floor is yours.

“1. War of Will (2-1 morning line). Only Curlin (1:53.46) in 2007 has registered a faster final time in the Preakness than War of Will (1:54.34) this year since Louis Quatorze (1:53.40) in 1996. Sure, the track for this year's Preakness was faster than usual. But even when taking that into consideration, I don't think War of Will is getting the credit he probably deserves for his Preakness performance. His final time was faster than such other Preakness winners in the last 20 years as California Chrome (1:54.84), Big Brown (1:54.86), Afleet Alex (1:55.04), Rachel Alexandra (1:55.08), Point Given (1:55.40), Lookin At Lucky (1:55.47) and Smarty Jones (1:55.59).

“Daily Racing Form's Matt Bernier wrote: ‘Most handicappers would immediately downgrade War of Will's effort because of the excellent trip he earned in Baltimore, but I think his effort may be better than it appears at face value.’ Bernier pointed out that in the Preakness, War of Will was relatively close to a hot pace, yet still ended up with the fourth-fastest come home time in the race.

“Meanwhile, do you realize that when War of Will had a wide trip and finished fifth in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf at Churchill Downs last Nov. 2, he managed to beat none other than the future winner of the historic Epsom Derby? That's right. At last year's Breeders’ Cup, 15-1 War of Will outran 3-1 favorite Anthony Van Dyke, who finished ninth. That very same Anthony Van Dyke won the 240th running of the original Derby of them all at Epsom Downs last Saturday.

“War of Will has the distinction of being the only one of the 10 entrants in Saturday's 151st running of the Belmont to start in all three Triple Crown events this year. Of course, running in those three races at three different distances at three different tracks within the period of five weeks is a grind. Sweeping all three is difficult and rare. There have been just 13 Triple Crown winners, the most recent being Justify last year.

“Because War of Will is being asked to endure the entire Triple Crown grind, his task to win the 1 1/2-mile Belmont is made more difficult by having to face rivals--most notably Tacitus--who are fresher for not having run in the Preakness. This definitely is a concern when it comes to War of Will.

“But keep in mind the Preakness really was only War of Will’s second meaningful race since he won the Risen Star Stakes on Feb. 16. He certainly did not get much out of the March 23 Louisiana Derby . War of Will took an awkward start shortly after the start of the Louisiana Derby and finished ninth. He emerged from that race with a strained patellar ligament, according to trainer Mark Casse . Inasmuch as the May 4 Kentucky Derby (in which he was impeded approaching the five-sixteenths marker) and May 18 Preakness have been War of Will's only real meaningful races since Feb. 16, he might have more gas in his tank for the Belmont than a lot of people think.

“2. Tacitus (9-5 morning-line favorite). I wrote last week that in terms of Belmont Stakes betting, I expect Tacitus to be the favorite, but not by a lot over War of Will. Belmont Park oddsmaker David Aragona obviously sees it the same way as he has pegged Tacitus as the 9-5 morning-line favorite, with War of Will a close second choice at 2-1.

“It's not difficult to understand why so many people are picking Tacitus to win the Belmont. He has a lot going for him.

“By not running in the Preakness, Tacitus has the advantage of being fresher for the Belmont than War of Will.

“Tacitus' trainer, jockey, owner and breeding also add to the colt's appeal. His trainer is Hall of Famer Bill Mott, who sent out Drosselmeyer to win the 2010 Belmont. Tacitus' jockey is Jose Ortiz, who won the 2017 Belmont aboard Tapwrit. Juddmonte Farms owns Tacitus. Juddmonte Farms won the 2003 Belmont with Empire Maker. Tacitus is a son of Tapit and 2014 Eclipse Award champion older female Close Hatches. Tapit has sired three of the last five Belmont Stakes winners (Tonalist in 2014, Creator in 2016 and Tapwrit in 2017).

“After winning the Tampa Bay Derby and Wood Memorial when he overcame a troubled trip, Tacitus exhibited good late energy in the Kentucky Derby. As far back as 16th early in the Run for the Roses, Tacitus finished fourth on the sloppy track and was elevated to third through the disqualification of Maximum Security . Maximum Security finished first but was DQ'd to 17th for causing interference to War of Will, Bodexpress and Long Range Toddy approaching the five-sixteenth pole.

“All in all, Tacitus has an excellent chance to be posing for pictures after Saturday's Belmont.

“3. Sir Winston (12-1). Casse trains Sir Winston in addition to War of Will. Sir Winston rallied to finish second in the 1 1/8-mile Peter Pan Stakes on May 11 at odds of 14-1, an effort that could set him up nicely for the longer Belmont Stakes.

“Not one of the 10 entrants in this year's Belmont Stakes has won on the Belmont Park main track. Sir Winston is the only one of the 10 to have finished at least second. His pedigree suggests he might relish long-distance races. His sire is Awesome Again, who won the 1 1/4-mile Breeders' Cup Classic in 1998. Sir Winston's maternal grandsire is 2005 Belmont winner Afleet Alex.

“Sir Winston's jockey is Joel Rosario , who won the 2014 Belmont on Tonalist.

“4. Spinoff (15-1). He seemed to detest running on the sloppy surface in the Kentucky Derby and wound up 18th. Spinoff finished second in the Louisiana Derby on March 23, a particularly good effort considering it was only his second race since last Aug. 12. In his 2019 debut, Spinoff raised eyebrows when he won by nearly 12 lengths at Tampa Bay Downs on Feb. 22.

“Spinoff's trainer is Todd Pletcher , who has won the Belmont three times (Rags to Riches in 2007, Palace Malice in 2013 and Tapwrit in 2017). Spinoff's jockey is Hall of Famer Javier Castellano , who has finished second in the Belmont three times ( Stay Thirsty in 2011, Commissioner in 2014 and Destin in 2016).

“5. Intrepid Heart (10-1). He's trained by Pletcher. As mentioned, Pletcher has three Belmont Stakes victories to his credit. The Belmont Stakes has been a longtime goal for Intrepid Heart.

“Unraced as a 2-year-old, Intrepid Heart crushed maidens when unveiled at Oaklawn Park on Feb. 18. He then won a race at Keeneland by a half-length on April 5. Sent off as the favorite at a little under 6-5 in the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont, Intrepid Heart stumbled at the start and finished third, 4 3/4 lengths behind runner-up Sir Winston. Global Campaign won the Peter Pan by 1 1/4 lengths.

“It's certainly understandable why the Belmont Stakes seems a good fit for Intrepid Heart because he's by Tapit (sire of three Belmont winners) and a half-brother to Commissioner, who at odds of 28-1 finished second, a head behind Tonalist, in the 2014 Belmont.

“Intrepid Heart's jockey is Hall of Famer John Velazquez , who has won the Belmont twice (Rags to Riches in 2007 and Union Rags in 2012).

“My main concern regarding Intrepid Heart is he's running in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont with just three races under his belt. But at least all three races have been at a mile or longer.

“6. Everfast (12-1). When he finished second in the Preakness at odds of 29-1, he spoiled a great many exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers. That wasn't the first time he's finished second at big odds. He ran second in Gulfstream Park's Holy Bull Stakes last Feb. 2 when dismissed at 128-1. Between the Holy Bull and Preakness, Everfast lost three races by 18 1/2, 15 and 10 1/4 lengths.

“Everfast races for Brad Kelley's Calumet Farm. For Kelley, Oxbow finished second in the 2013 Belmont. Calumet Farm (long before Kelley assumed overship) won the Belmont twice, both times with a Triple Crown winner (Whirlaway in 1941 and Citation in 1948).

“7. Tax (15-1). Runner-up in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 6, Tax was no factor in the Kentucky Derby when he finished 15th and was moved up to 14th through the disqualification of Maximum Security. Other than the Kentucky Derby, he has never finished worse than third.

“Irad Ortiz Jr. will pilot Tax in the Belmont. Ortiz won the 2016 Belmont with Creator.

“8. Bourbon War (12-1). He certainly had his share of supporters in the Preakness. Indeed, Bourbon War's 5-1 odds in that race were shorter than War of Will's 6-1. Bourbon War lacked early speed in the Preakness, never menaced and finished eighth.

“Bourbon War is another this year who could possibly give Tapit a fourth Belmont victory as a sire.

“In the Preakness, Bourbon War raced with blinkers for the first time. Trainer Mark Hennig is removing Bourbon War's blinkers for the Belmont.

"" Mike Smith is Bourbon War's jockey. Hall of Famer Smith and Justify collaborated to take the 2018 Belmont when that colt became this country's 13th Triple Crown winner. Smith also won the Belmont in 2010 aboard Drosselmeyer and in 2013 on Palace Malice.

9. Master Fencer (8-1). After winning two of six starts in his native Japan, Master Fencer exceeded the expectations of many in the Kentucky Derby. Virtually ignored by bettors, he lost by only four lengths at odds of 58-1 after being as far back as 23 lengths early. He finished seventh and was elevated to sixth via the DQ of Maximum Security. In light of Master Fencer's Kentucky Derby rally, perhaps he will have a big say in the longer Belmont. But at morning line odds of 8-1, I just can't get enthused.

“10. Joevia (30-1). He is expected to show early speed, as he did when he splashed his way to a 2 3/4-length triumph on a sloppy track May 12 in the 1 1/16-mile Long Branch Stakes at Monmouth Park. When Tacitus and Tax finished first and second, respectively, in the April 6 Wood Memorial at the Big A, Joevia ended up seventh and was disqualified to 11th for causing interference early.

“In a nutshell, it will be a gigantic upset if Joevia wins the 2019 Belmont Stakes.”

Santa Anita preview

Friday’s card at Santa Anita is pretty uninspiring, but the track is likely saving things up for Belmont Stakes day. There are eight races, starting at 1 p.m. with five races for Cal-breds and four on the turf.

Combine those two factors and you come up with a feature, the fifth, a Cal-bred allowance/optional claimer for horses going five furlongs on the turf. The favorite, at 5-2, is Psycho Dar, who is coming off a second in a allowance. He’s been running a lot of nongraded (but yet black type) races. He’s two-for-12 lifetime and trained by Steve Miyadi and jockey Edwin Maldonado.

The second favorite, at 3-1, is Prodigal Son for Doug O’Neill and Martin Garcia. Now, this is a Paul Reddam horse and Mario Gutierrez isn’t riding him. Trouble in paradise? Nope, Mario is just back in Belmont riding some of Reddam’s better horses. Prodigal Son is one-for-four lifetime and third last out in an allowance. Post is aroud 3:10 p.m.

Here are the field sies, in order: 10, 5, 6, 5, 9 (2 also eligible), 6, 9 (4 ae), 8 (1 ae).

Ciaran Thornton’s SA pick of the day

RACE SEVEN: No. 9 Incredibly Lucky (8-1)

Incredibly Lucky tries turf for the first time, shortens up and drops for trainer Bill Spawr who is winning 25% at the meet, is 22% off the bench and 33% maiden to maiden claiming like today. Main jockey Tiago Pereira is 33% for this stable. We are getting 8-1 or more in this wide open race. This horse was bet to odds on in both starts so expectations were high. We also get a sharp work and the horse races protected today. Excellent value play for us.

Sunday’s result: It was another closing second-place finish for us, the second in a row. Heather’s Grey sat off the pace for the entire race positioned perfectly before gaining at the wire to run second. There was no catching the gate to wire winner but a nice performance by Heather’s Grey. Suprema ran dead last but our other selections ran 1-2-3 for a nice trifecta win.

Golden Gate weekend preview

We’re back with our weekly look at the best racing at Golden Gate Fields. As with the last couple meetings, we’re delighted to have race caller and all-around good guy Matt Dinerman as our host for previews and other musings. But this is his last one of the meeting as Golden Gate takes a break on Sunday. But, Matt will be back, so, take it away for the last preview of this meeting.

“With three more live racing days on the calendar, Golden Gate Fields has a number of competitive, quality races lined up. Nine races are posted on the Friday overnight, with first post set at 12:45 p.m. The fifth race has a field of 12 on the turf and goes as Leg C of the Stronach 5 wager, with a guaranteed pool of $100,000. My top pick is the 2-1 morning-line favorite Thorn Hill Cat, who last lost to Sith Lord, who came back to run a terrific second in a starter allowance. Thorn Hill Cat competes in a $20,000 claimer on Friday.

“There’s 11 races Saturday, with the feature going as the Albany Stakes. An appealing Golden Pick Six sequence includes a pair of competitive maiden special weights, an allowance for 3-year-old fillies and the $50,000 Albany Stakes.

“The Albany, which goes as the ninth race, is for 3-year-olds and up going five furlongs on the turf. Southern California shipper Brandothebartender draws the rail for his second lifetime start on the Golden Gate turf and may go off favored. The son of Tribal Rule comes off a fourth-place finish in the Grade 3 Daytona Stakes at Santa Anita. My top pick in the race is Mike’s Tiznow, who looks like the lone speed and adores the five-furlong turf distance and surface. He’s 8-1 on the morning line and draws ghe seven for trainer Andy Mathis and jockey Ricky Gonzalez.

“Closing day Sunday has a 12-race program, with first post time at 1:15 p.m. The $0.20 Golden Pick Six, the Rolling Super High Five and the early and late Pick 5 wagers have mandatory payouts on Sunday, which means larger than normal pool sizes. Heading into Friday’s card, the Golden Pick Six has a carryover of just over $36,000. Also, we have a guaranteed late Pick 4 pool of $100,000 on Sunday.

“In other news, Golden Gate Fields welcomes back jockey Kyle Frey. The journeyman rider took an extended period of time off after sustaining a serious leg injury over the summer at Del Mar. Frey has two listed mounts on Saturday afternoon and five more on Sunday. “I’m really excited to get back to riding,” Frey said. “I’ve been working horses and feel really healthy. I’ll be ready to go this weekend.”

“Going into Friday, Jockey Abel Cedillo has 126 wins and sits atop the jockey standings. Juan Hernandez has the second most wins amongst riders with 103. Jonathan Wong has wrapped up a fourth consecutive training title at Golden Gate Fields with a whopping 85 wins at the winter/spring meet. Jerry Hollendorfer holds second place with 41 wins while John Martin completes the top three placing’s, equating 34 victories at the current meeting.

“Thank you to all of the horseplayers, fans and horsemen for a fantastic winter/spring meet. Live racing resumes on Thursday, Aug. 15, the first day of our summer meeting, which runs through Sunday, Sept. 29. Have a great summer.”

Los Alamitos weekend preview

It’s time to turn things over to marketing and meda guru Orlando Gutierrez, who will tell us about the upcoming weekend at Los Alamitos. Orlando, the floor is yours.

“Los Alamitos will open at 8 a.m. for simulcasting of the Belmont Stakes card from New York. The clubhouse and Vessels Club will open at 9 a.m. to bring all the great East Coast racing action. On Saturday night, Los Alamitos will host an eight-race program featuring thoroughbred and quarter-horse racing starting at 6:35 p.m.

“The racing week kicks off on Friday night starting at 7 p.m. There will four stakes, including Steve McIntyre and Marin Jones’ Grade 2 PCQHRA Breeders Futurity winner Cole Man 47, who will be headline the seventh race at 300 yards. Named after McIntyre’s grandson, Cole Man 47 won the John Deere California Juvenile Challenge in addition to his Breeders’ Futurity triumph. He's been a factor in several other stakes races, qualifying to the Grade 1 Los Alamitos Winter Derby earlier this year and last year's Robert Adair Kindergarten Futurity. Paul Jones will saddle the Utah-bred gelding by Stel Corona, who'll start from the four.

“Tac Me Up, the winner of the Autumn Handicap last year, and Genuine Version, winner of the 2017 Adequan California Derby Challenge, are also in this event.

“Multiple stakes winner Run Raging Rhino Run, who has scored black type wins at 550 and 870 yards this year, will head the evening's third race -- an allowance event around the turn.

“There are 11 races Sunday night and all of them trials at 350 yards to the Grade 1 Ed Burke Million Futurity. Ten of the 11 trials will have eight-horse fields with seven horses slated for the fourth race. The Ed Burke hopefuls include Mental Error and Dreams Divine, the second- and third-place finishers in the Grade 2 Robert Adair Kindergarten Futurity last month. The horses with the 10 fastest times will advance to the Ed Burke Million final on Sunday, June 23.”

Ed Burgart’s LA pick of the day

FIFTH RACE: No. 5 Fayvorite Chick (7-2)

Filly looked solid in last 12.4 gate drill in preparation for debut and is out of productive dam Chicks Tell, who dropped 2019 debut winner Tell Cartel last month. In her last work, she broke well and was under restraint during final 1/16 while having plenty of run on mind. Her trainer Matt Fales, has won with 16 of 64 starters this meet.

645,"Julian Assange, Bryan Carmody and the increasingly fraught world of journalism",Patt Morrison,"Two cases – a world-renowned one in London and a lesser-known one in San Francisco – are ramping up legal pressure on the practices of journalists and the protections of journalism in public interest and national security matters. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces extradition to the United States and prosecution here under the century-old Espionage Act , accused of soliciting and distributing national defense information he got by working with Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning . A Justice Department official contended that Assange “is no journalist.” And San Francisco police executed a search warrant with sledgehammers when they went after freelancer Bryan Carmody, to find out how he got his hands on the leaked death report of San Francisco’s public defender. The police chief apologized for “mistakes,” and the mayor has ordered an investigation.

With a long resume as a working journalist, Doreen Weisenhaus is now at Northwestern University, teaching both law and media ethics, as well as directing its media law and policy initiative. For her, the significant question in each case is not about who is a journalist so much as it is, what action is being taken that qualifies as journalism?

Click here for the full archive of ""Patt Morrison Asks"" podcasts »

The world of journalism has changed. The ethics, the standards, the rules haven't changed, but the world of reporting and its challenges have very much changed.

I think the ethical challenges are really encapsulated in these two cases that seem to be grabbing everyone's attention. Of course Julian Assange, and then having the indictment and the national security leaks and the publishing of that information, as well as the case involving the San Francisco journalist, or some would say freelancer who also provided journalistic information.

And that is, what is journalism today? And what are the ethical standards? Are they the same as they were in prior years? What are the duties and rights and responsibilities? Do they need to make sure that they curate information, or can they just dump information out?

A lot of press freedom issues, 1st Amendment issues used to be abstractions, and now they're very real, and are being tested. Can you give some examples of ethical dilemmas that we confront now that we might not have before?

I go back to the Julian Assange case. One of the issues that the indictment charged against Julian Assange was the fact that he encouraged sources to produce illegally obtained information. And the question is, is there any kind of ethical standard for that?

The New York Times, for example, on their website, they have instructions on how someone who might want to give them some document that shows some kind of government malfeasance, and offers different types of tech tools that allow them to maintain their anonymity and to encourage them to present this type of information.

Clearly the law definitely recognizes the difference. And it does not protect journalists who are involved in hacking to get information, or encouraging or instructing or directing someone to hack information. And that the journalist's activities would not be protected.

But there seems to be at times a fine line to what would constitute encouragement of those who might want to provide this type of information. And that is part of the bread and butter of what journalists do, to not just obtain information, but also to encourage those who have information to provide — particularly involving national security cases where there is no regular release of this type of information.

These are part of the lifeblood of any national security journalist, and trying to get secrets that the governments may not want to disclose.

The world of the internet has created the possibility of perhaps everybody becoming a publisher or a journalist. But is that all it takes, is having a website and hitting the send key?

No, I don't think so, necessarily. But it's difficult to try to define who a journalist is, and the last thing you want is someone like the government to define who is a journalist and who is not a journalist.

And of course in the Julian Assange case, they were quite clear in saying, oh, we could bring these charges against Julian Assange because he is not a journalist.

But the issue today is that it's quite different, right? That it’s the activity of gathering, assessing, creating and publishing news and information.

But the problem is that 1st Amendment protections do not depend on one's status as a journalist, that it does not issue these kind of special protections just to the press.

So you have to allow the opportunity that there might be more nontraditional actors in this current, expanded media ecosystem that didn't exist before the advent of the internet, for example.

So where does Julian Assange fit in this? This is a man who didn't seem to edit anything that he put out there in the way that journalists always do.

Let me answer your question with a question, and that is, what does constitute a journalist? Certainly we may disagree with the fact that he did not curate. We may think that there might have been some ethical issues.

It does not depend on what is the status of the individual. It's, what is the journalistic activity? Did he present information that is of national interest?

And certainly the hundreds of thousands of documents and information that came out during the Chelsea Manning leaks that made huge headlines — not just presented by Julian Assange but also picked up by all kinds of national media, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Guardian, newspapers all over the world picked up that information.

I'm looking at the definition in the context of the law and what the law should protect and not protect.

And there seems to be this fine line between what Julian Assange did and what more traditional media have done. What makes this particular case so critical is that a big part of the charges were not involving the hacking of information, but the encouragement of Chelsea Manning to provide this information, which is what many traditional journalists do, and also the publishing of the information.

This appears to be it for the first time the U.S. government is prosecuting, under the Espionage Act, a publisher of classified documents. And that indeed is what Julian Assange did — publish this information.

I think the big concern is that some of these activities are definitely part of what journalists’ activities are considered legitimate in today's environment. And yet are these now going to be subject to these new types of prosecution?

Also, in the press briefing right after the indictment came down, a Justice Department spokesman said, we are very clear that this is not a journalist, and therefore the acts that we are alleging done by Julian Assange will not impact you.

But the truth is that in some of the charges, it is about pure publication, in that they focus only on Assange having posted these documents on the internet and don't depend on any other action, whether it's curated or not curated. So that whether they encourage the leak or receive the information, that's a first.

And that's why there's a lot of concern about what might be happening in the future, because this is opening a door. And many consider this kind of a watershed moment, particularly for organizations that want to report about national security issues.

What is new, of course, is this idea of applying this very old law, the Espionage Act, which was passed by Congress in a panic as the U.S. was entering World War I in 1917, to quash dissent. For over a hundred years it was never used to prosecute a media organization for publishing or disseminating unlawfully disclosed classified information.

And now it has.

What's at stake in the outcome for newsgathering, news reporting organizations?

Two big threats. Gabe Rottman, of the Reporters Committee [for Freedom of the Press], describes it in a way that I would like to quote: He calls this kind of an erosion of this informal detente between law enforcement, the military intelligence community and the media, that what the Trump administration has done is possibly even surpassing what had started in the Obama and Bush administration efforts, to bring charges against leakers based on the Espionage Act.

That aggression has to be hurting journalists where it counts: getting sources to give information on critically important work that's being done by their increasingly secretive government.

And the second impact is what others see as dangerous to those outside the U.S. We've seen over the last couple of years Trump's characterization that journalists are enemies of the people, and that’s encouraged authoritarian governments to step up their harsh treatment of their own media, knowing that the U.S. will not respond.

The killing of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi had no impact whatsoever on White House policy.

So this may encourage an already existing trend of other authoritarian governments to continue prosecuting journalists for just publishing sensitive and secretive information.

If the American protections and high standards and high regard for journalism are deliberately degraded by the government, then in a way that takes away a standard of protection that other countries used to point to to say, we should be like the United States?

Even more practical: where the U.S. government used to insist that other countries respect human rights, respect press freedoms, they don't see that type of economic or political pressure on the part of the U.S. government.

It’s almost like a hands-off, you do your own thing, and the chips fall where they may.

I recently was giving training sessions in Asia and in Africa, and the reporters there report quite vividly that things are progressing in a more rapid pace in their own countries, knowing that there won't be any interference or pressure on the part of the U.S. government to respect press freedom issues.

The rhetoric that journalists are enemies of the people has definitely contributed to an atmosphere where violence and threats against journalists have escalated.

Last week, for example, a radio reporter in Alaska was assaulted while she was covering a demonstration at a Planned Parenthood clinic. A TV reporter in Florida was attacked this month while covering a routine burglary in a neighborhood. The bomb threats to CNN, online harassment of journalists. And so there is this real, direct impact on how journalists are doing their jobs.

But I have to say, at the same time, there is also this hunger and support for real journalism. There are many who are looking and trying to find ways to get legitimate information.

In the Bryan Carmody case in San Francisco, the police showing up with sledgehammers to break into the man’s place to look for documents, for records. The authorities themselves have walked this back but that still doesn't lay to rest the issue that came up first, which is, this is a man who listens to police scanners, goes out and takes pictures, gets information and then is in the service of news agencies selling that information to them — which is something that's been done for quite a long while by freelancers.

The question here initially was, was he a journalist. Was he not? Someone who has a history, as he did, of producing or finding journalistic material for many of the area's media outlets — it becomes indistinguishable in terms of, OK, so they publish it and they get protection.

It didn't quite make sense, and I think everyone was coming to that conclusion. And fortunately for Mr. Carmody, California has a very strong reporter shield law that defined anyone as a journalist who is “connected with or employed by a news organization.” And in this case, he clearly was connected with, because he had regular relationships in which he sold journalistic material to these news organizations.

Under the circumstances, it's too much to hope for a national shield law, which comes up from time to time.

I don't quite see it happening in the current congressional environment. I think the last proposal was two years ago, and much discussion about this issue of defining who a journalist was. They were trying to define a journalist by someone who made a certain percentage of his or her income in journalistic activity, which of course could be a high bar for someone who might be doing other things to support themselves, but at the same time might be performing an act of journalism.

What will you be watching for in particular in the proceedings against Assange?

We are watching in particular whether he actually ever ends up getting extradited to the U.S. I would like to know more about some of the underlying intentions on the part of the government in looking at this case.

And another issue might be any further action on the part of the government. Joel Simon, [the executive director] of the Committee to Protect Journalists, [said] there might be dangers to others outside the U.S., where anybody writing about U.S. national security could be vulnerable.

You have to remember, Assange is not a U.S. citizen. He was Australian. Every act he did was outside the U.S. And so this idea of an extraterritorial jurisdiction in a publishing case is usually for terrorism or piracy.

But now, can anyone in the world be prosecuted for publishing what the U.S. considers to be classified information involving the U.S.? Is there this kind of threat about other cases that might be brought in the future?

654,The D-day photos that must be seen,Ml Cavanaugh,"Some photos must be taken, some images must be seen. These thoughts must have motivated photographer Robert Capa 75 years ago as he plunged off a landing craft and onto Omaha Beach with an early wave of the D-day landings.

“If your pictures aren’t good enough,” Capa famously advised, then “you’re not close enough.”

He was close enough on June 6, 1944, to secure what are now known as the Magnificent Eleven, the surviving images on four rolls of film delivered from Normandy to London just a day and a half after the Allied assault on Europe began. Five of the photos — “slightly out of focus,” in Capa’s words — were published in the next issue of Life magazine, dated June 19, 1944: Battle scenes in blurred black and white; frenzied, grim.

(Robert Capa / Magnum Photos) U.S. troops assault Omaha Beach during the D-Day landings.(Robert Capa / Magnum Photos) Scenes from the U.S. landing on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, 75 years ago. (Robert Capa / Magnum Photos)

The stark face of a helmeted soldier caught in swirling water, often cited as the iconic image of the “longest day,” captured the landing’s essential danger: drown or fight. Capa’s D-day shots reportedly inspired director Steven Spielberg’s wrenching, realistic take on the landings in “Saving Private Ryan.” To pierce Hitler’s Atlantic Wall, more than 16,000 Americans would die and 40,000 would be wounded by the end of July.

Great photos matter. They do two things, simultaneously: zoom us in on some frozen moment, and then widen our apertures to the world in a way that transcends words alone.

Often the pictures that hit us hardest depict violence. Of the 133 winners of the Pulitzer Prizes for photography, more than half — 69 — have been connected in some way to man-made conflict. Given a choice, the prize-givers honor such images because, as graphic and grisly as they may be, they are crucial to public understanding in a dangerous world.

During the Vietnam War, Eddie Adams’ image of a Saigon street-side execution during the Tet Offensive and Nick Ut’s of a naked child fleeing a napalm attack were as powerful as they were brutal. In 1991, Greg Marinovich captured the mayhem during the fall of apartheid in South Africa. He had pleaded with vigilante killers to stop, but when they didn’t, he kept shooting, and the photograph of a machete splitting a victim’s flaming skull told the story to the world.

Seeing is still believing, as long as the image is authentic, which is another way of underlining Capa’s commandment to get “close enough.” Horst Faas, himself the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, once described crawling to the “forward trenches of a besieged outpost” and waiting “beside riflemen in night ambushes” to get a good shot during the Vietnam War. “We worked hard to be truthful,” he wrote in a collection of Pulitzer images, and purposely “avoided pictures of the bizarre and the atypical.”

A photo might very well be real, it might be representative, but the final question is often the toughest: Is it relevant?

“If it makes you laugh, if it makes you cry, if it rips out your heart, that’s a good picture,” said Adams.

Americans a world away from the battle are obliged to stop and stare at such pictures; never more so than in the 21st century. The post-9/11 war costs so far are tallied at just under $6 trillion, with about 7,000 U.S. troops killed in action, 50,000 wounded and a staggering quarter of a million civilian lives lost. Because fewer and fewer Americans are in uniform, those of us on the home front are less and less aware of war’s terrible reality.

D-day photos like this one reportedly inspired Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan."" Robert Capa / Magnum Photos

Of course, images of violence can carry a deadly dark side. Islamic State propaganda has relied on gory imagery to amplify its terror, as did the mosque shooter in New Zealand in March, who weaponized his attack once in person and then again on a Facebook feed.

In response, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is leading an effort to “end terrorist and violent extremist content online.” And yet even well-intentioned censorship of such images can sweep up important pictures, as we learned when Facebook took down, and then reinstated, Ut’s powerful “Napalm Girl” photo.

Army Gen. William T. Sherman once defined war as cruelty: “You cannot refine it.” Despite the risks and discomforts of seeing that cruelty, we must look at its ugly face squarely.

“Bullets tore into the water around me,” Capa wrote about his 90 minutes on Omaha Beach in the early hours of D-day. In that short time, shooting with a camera instead of a gun, he brought the war home to Americans. Seventy-five years later, we still get the picture.

Army Lt. Col. ML Cavanaugh is a non-resident fellow with the Modern War Institute at West Point, and co-edited, with Max Brooks and others, “Winning Westeros: How Game of Thrones Explains Modern Military Conflict.”

Look no further than what’s happened to women’s reproductive rights since Roe vs. Wade. After the court ruled in Roe in 1973 that women had a constitutional right to an abortion, Republican-controlled state governments immediately began challenging the ruling with an onslaught of new laws limiting a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions. Those unconstitutional and restrictive laws were not overturned until 1992, nearly two decades later. And now, we are watching firsthand as Republican-controlled state governments in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and elsewhere take the lead on challenging the very foundations of Roe with egregious abortion bans. There are zero reasons to assume the GOP won’t use its control of state governments to challenge a new Supreme Court precedent on partisan gerrymandering with new gerrymandered maps in 2021 as well.","Need more proof of Republican willingness to go around the Supreme Court to get their way?

Why: McWay Falls, the splashiest attraction in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, roars down 80 feet from granite and redwoods to a creamy Big Sur beach and implausibly turquoise cove. It’s the cascade that other waterfalls want to be. It’s also a perfectly impossible California destination, because you can’t stand under these falls. There’s no safe way to the beach.

What: The hike is more of a stroll, really. It’s about half a mile, mostly flat. (And the rest of the park remains mostly closed because of mudslides and other damage done by the Soberanes Fire of 2016.) Once you’ve passed through a short tunnel under Highway 1 and made a right turn, you’ll soon be standing on a rocky perch where a house once stood, looking south to the beach and falls.

This is an invitation to chill. For one thing, the trail has ended. Also, like Yosemite Falls — which led off our California Bucket List project on Jan. 1 — McWay Falls is a sort of perpetuity made plain. The water keeps coming, even if it’s in short supply elsewhere.

732,Seven summer heat-beating ideas from our California Bucket List,Christopher Reynolds,"Here are several ideas for fighting the heat that’s baking so much of the state right now. Most are in Southern California, a few are farther north. All are drawn from our popular California Bucket List, which has grown to more than 365 entries.

San Diego

Crystal Pier Hotel, Pacific Beach , San Diego. Christopher Reynolds/Los Angeles Times

Why: You won't find another pier in California with cottages on it, and this pier stands along one of San Diego's most popular beaches.

What: The Crystal Pier Hotel & Cottages go back to the 1930s. Despite changes in owners (and many a dispute with city officials) in early decades, the operation has been run by the same family since 1961. The pier is wooden, with fishing at the end. The 31 units are painted white with blue trim and flower boxes. The beachfront promenade, Ocean Front Walk, is San Diego's answer to Venice -- a boisterous concentration of people, bikes and beach culture that runs three miles through the Pacific Beach and Mission Beach neighborhoods.

Where: 4500 Ocean Blvd., San Diego, 115 miles southeast of downtown L.A.

How much: Rooms (with kitchenettes) run $380 to $600 in summer, with a three-night minimum. And take note: You can't make reservations online -- just by phone and in person.

Jalama

Jalama Beach County Park, Santa Barbara County. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times

Why: Raw coastline, juicy burgers.

What: To reach Jalama Beach County Park, you follow a twisting, two-lane highway from Lompoc to the edge of the continent and confront a horizon full of rough surf and raw, windy coastline. This campground (better for beachcombing than swimming) feels solitary, but there's a general store where they'll make you a Jalama Burger (carnivores, say yes) and sell you firewood or groceries, wine or beer. There are 109 campsites, some cabins, hot showers, a playground and a set of railroad tracks.

Where: 9999 Jalama Road, Lompoc — which is actually 18 miles southwest of Lompoc, 170 miles northwest of downtown L.A.

How much: $10 per car. Jalama Burger, $7.95.

Bolsa Chica, Huntington Beach

Mike Anderson of Covina relaxes under an umbrella next to his Casita at Bolsa Chica State Beach in Huntington Beach. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times

Why: It's elementary. Homo sapiens like sitting on sand, watching water lap the shore while a bonfire crackles in a light breeze.

What: Bolsa Chica State Beach is a prime beach bonfire destination, three miles long, with 200 fire rings available nightly (first come, first served) from 6 to 10 p.m.

That's an increasingly rare distinction. Authorities have banned fires in many coastal areas, focusing increased attention on those that remain.

Bolsa Chica, a long, flat beach, is also known for its surf fishing and grunion runs. Just inland you have the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, a 1,300-acre estuary and wetlands area that attracts about 200 species of birds (and almost as many sub-species of birders). There are various beach concessions nearby.

Where: Bolsa Chica, north of Huntington Beach's Seapoint Street and south of Warner Avenue, is 33 miles south of downtown L.A.

How much: Day use is $15 per car.

Bolinas, Marin County

Smiley's Schooner Saloon & Hotel, Bolinas, Calif. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times

Why: Bolinas, a lagoon-adjacent haven of 1,600 bohemian souls in an oft-overlooked corner of Marin County, has been operating incognito for decades. Locals steal road signs so that outsiders can't find their way in.

Now that attitude might be softening, and the town, surrounded by hiking, surfing and kayaking opportunities, is fascinating.

What: About 50 years ago, hardcore Bolinas locals started stealing the town's highway sign and they never stopped. The goal, conceived in back-to-the-land idealism, was to build a nature-friendly community without the distractions and economic distortions of tourism.

But as properties turn over and GPS renders signage moot, Bolinas seems to be evolving. Whether you're on the water or Wharf Road, it's a great place to think about hippie legacies and the nature of community at a time when Bay Area real estate is very nearly a blood sport.

Don't expect a tourist welcome center, but if you show up mellow and humble there's no reason you shouldn't drop in for a bite at the Coast Cafe; browse the tiny but well-appointed Bolinas Museum (open Fridays through Sundays only), or drink at Smiley's Schooner Saloon and Hotel, which goes back to the 19th century.

In fact, Smiley's (which got new owners in 2015) offers live music four nights a week and rents out six rooms in back. I slept comfortably in one. On the street and in Smiley's, I was an obvious outsider with a camera around my neck, but everyone I met treated me well.

You'll see plenty of gray ponytails (and experience rotten cellphone service). And keep an eye out for BO Gas, the only nonprofit service station I've ever encountered. The rates are shockingly high ($4.66 a gallon in early August) but the money helps support the Bolinas Community Land Trust.

Where: Wharf Road, the commercial heart of town, is 25 miles northwest of San Francisco, just north of Stinson Beach, south of Point Reyes Station, 414 miles northwest of downtown L.A.

How much: It's free to take a walk or check out the museum. The rooms at Smiley's go for $135-$225 nightly.

Info: There's no Bolinas Visitors Bureau — probably never will be. But there's a Marin Convention & Visitors Bureau to tell you what's nearby.

La Jolla

Sunny Jim Sea Cave, with kayakers beyond, in La Jolla. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times

Why: It'll make you feel like a pirate. Or a sea lion.

What: Back in the first years of the 20th century, somebody hatched a nutty idea and hired two guys to start digging through this sandstone bluff top toward a sea cave below. And they made it.

Nowadays, this neighborhood's real estate prices are enough to chase mere millionaires away, but if you enter the modest-looking Cave Store and head for the rustic-looking stairwell, the tunnel remains.

Its 145 steps will take you down to where waves crash and sea lions sometimes bellow. Chances are you'll also see kayakers through the opening as they make their own approach to the same cave. (The store also stocks jewelry, art and souvenirs.)

The cave was nicknamed ""Sunny Jim"" by Frank Baum (author of ""The Wizard Oz"") because the outline of the opening looks like a cartoon character called Sunny Jim who was used in advertisements for British Force Wheat cereal products in the early 20th century. (Sunny Jim had unruly hair toward the back of his head.)

Where: 1325 Coast Blvd., La Jolla, 115 miles southeast of downtown L.A.

How much: $5 for adults, $3 for kids 16 and younger. Open daily. Kayak tours of the caves start at about $40.

Manhattan Beach

Why: If this were just any wealthy beach city, it would be a great place to run, bike, surf, people-watch and nurse your real estate envy. But Manhattan Beach is also the birthplace of beach volleyball as a way of life. Whenever you visit, you'll probably see seriously talented athletes at play.

What: Among the South Bay beach cities of Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan, this is the northernmost and wealthiest. Plenty of restaurants and shops are lined up on Manhattan Beach Boulevard, the main drag.

At the end of the boulevard, the concrete Manhattan Beach Pier reaches 928 feet into the sea, with a cafe and the small, kid-friendly Roundhouse Aquarium at the end.

The volleyball happens on the sand courts just north and south of the pier. Besides frequent competitions there are lots of classes for kids and adults. Be warned that the Manhattan Beach Open, a summer institution since 1960, draws tens of thousands of fans, making a demanding parking situation downright diabolical.

No matter when you visit, you can read the brass plaques along the pier's Manhattan Beach Open Volleyball Walk of Fame: Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings has seven plaques there. Karch Kiraly, also an Olympic gold medalist, has 10.

Take a walk along the Strand or bike the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. (Both parallel the shore).

Get a beer at Rock'n Fish, a cone at the always-busy Manhattan Beach Creamery, or a meal at any hour in The Kettle. (All three are within a few blocks on Manhattan Beach Boulevard.) The Shade Hotel is a short walk away, pricey and stylish, in Metlox Plaza.

Where: The Manhattan Beach Pier is 22 miles southwest of downtown L.A., 5 miles south of LAX.

How much: Ice cream cones at the Manhattan Beach Creamery cost $5.25 for a single, $6.25 for a double. Homes along the Strand routinely fetch $10 million.

Santa Monica

Pacific Wheel, Pacific Park, Santa Monica Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times

Why: Unless you charter a flight or build a better jetpack, you won't get this view of Santa Monica, the bay and city, any other way.

What: The Santa Monica Pier went up in 1909, was largely rebuilt in the 1980s, and added an amusement park, Pacific Park, in the 1990s. Basically, it's the payoff at the end of Route 66. Its high point, about 130 feet up, is the Pacific Wheel, a Ferris wheel that started spinning in 1996.

On your way to the wheel, notice the carousel, which you might remember from the 1973 movie ""The Sting.""

Once you're aloft, take a good look at those bright lights all around you. They were amped up in May 2016. This is billed as the world’s first and perhaps only solar-powered Ferris wheel. Kids taller than 42 inches can ride alone.

Where: 380 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, L.A. County, 16.7 miles west of downtown L.A.

How much: $10 a ride.

The line to walk the property can get very long — and the traffic and parking situation in the blocks around the hotel can seem downright devilish.

737,"Fly, roll, float and romp in a Disney's ever-evolving California Adventure",Christopher Reynolds,"(Christopher Reynolds/Los Angeles Times)

Why: McWay Falls, the splashiest attraction in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, roars down 80 feet from granite and redwoods to a creamy Big Sur beach and implausibly turquoise cove. It’s the cascade that other waterfalls want to be. It’s also a perfectly impossible California destination, because you can’t stand under these falls. There’s no safe way to the beach.

What: The hike is more of a stroll, really. It’s about half a mile, mostly flat. (And the rest of the park remains mostly closed because of mudslides and other damage done by the Soberanes Fire of 2016.) Once you’ve passed through a short tunnel under Highway 1 and made a right turn, you’ll soon be standing on a rocky perch where a house once stood, looking south to the beach and falls.

This is an invitation to chill. For one thing, the trail has ended. Also, like Yosemite Falls — which led off our California Bucket List project on Jan. 1 — McWay Falls is a sort of perpetuity made plain. The water keeps coming, even if it’s in short supply elsewhere. And the cell reception is so rotten that you’ll probably never get an Instagram photo posted from here.","(Christopher Reynolds/Los Angeles Times)Why: McWay Falls, the splashiest attraction in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, roars down 80 feet from granite and redwoods to a creamy Big Sur beach and implausibly turquoise cove.

Why: John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, Calif., a farming community that lacks the cachet of neighboring Carmel and Monterey. But, then, neither of those towns produced a man who went on to win a Pulitzer, a Nobel and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. To be in in Steinbeck’s hometown is to be reminded that, as fellow author F. Scott Fitzgerald said, “genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind.”

What: Steinbeck’s birthplace home and the National Steinbeck Center tell the tale of the man whose “Grapes of Wrath” is often thought to be the Great American Novel. The community of his youth — he was born here in 1902 — was this rich, rural farming area in the Salinas Valley, and his labors alongside migrant workers in the sugar beet fields of nearby Spreckels informed many of his works, including “Of Mice and Men.”

His subsequent books included “Cannery Row,” “Sea of Cortez” and “East of Eden” and, of course, “Grapes of Wrath,” about which he wrote, “It isn’t the great book I hoped it would be.” The story of the Joads, fleeing the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma and arriving in not-quite-as-billed California, won the Pulitzer in 1940.","(National Steinbeck Center)Why: John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, Calif., a farming community that lacks the cachet of neighboring Carmel and Monterey.
But, then, neither of those towns produced a man who went on to win a Pulitzer, a Nobel and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
To be in in Steinbeck’s hometown is to be reminded that, as fellow author F. Scott Fitzgerald said, “genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind.”What: Steinbeck’s birthplace home and the National Steinbeck Center tell the tale of the man whose “Grapes of Wrath” is often thought to be the Great American Novel.
The community of his youth — he was born here in 1902 — was this rich, rural farming area in the Salinas Valley, and his labors alongside migrant workers in the sugar beet fields of nearby Spreckels informed many of his works, including “Of Mice and Men.”(National Steinbeck Center)(Associated Press)He attended Stanford but never graduated, and he struggled to establish himself, but in 1935, his book “Tortilla Flat” finally put him in the public eye.

Why: If Big Sur is a temple to the beauty of the California coast, then the Henry Miller Memorial Library is one of its most endearing altars, a respite from the rigors of navigating the twists and turns of Highway 1 and rubber-necking the vertiginous coastline. Beneath stately redwoods is a quiet repository of wisdom, irreverence and charm. Its proprietors say that it is the place “where nothing happens,” and yet it is where everything seems to converge.

What: Henry Valentine Miller came to Big Sur in the 1940s after nearly a decade in Paris. He was, by then, author of “Tropic of Cancer” and “Tropic of Capricorn,” which were banned as obscene in America until 1961. Naturally they sold well, and Miller soon became a hero of renegade literature, a model for William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. After Miller’s death in Pacific Palisades in 1980, a friend, Emil White, opened a memorial library that bore Miller’s name. With the help of the Big Sur Land Trust, the library has become a nonprofit cultural space, art gallery, performance space, bookshop and destination for artists, writers, musicians and students.

It is a place to celebrate the macho and feminist, the consensual and the iconoclastic through the pages of its eclectic collection of books.

Why: Architects usually keep their daydreams to themselves. But among these hills on the back side of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, some students have allowed their boldest notions to romp free. And horses romp with them.

What: Cal Poly is routinely ranked among the nation’s top schools of architecture, and its students and professors started testing ideas in this canyon as early as the 1960s. Lately, there’s a spring Design Village event (April 20-22 in 2018) that brings students out to test temporary structures and sometimes sleep in them. Luckily for the rest of us, those nine acres and the rest of the canyon are generally open to the public, including dogs and mountain bikes (on the dirt road). It’s a hike of about 2.5 miles from campus to the farthest structure, but your mileage (and elevation gain) will depend on how tempted your are to probe the structures and stalk the horses.

At the Self-Realization Fellowship Meditation Gardens in Encinitas, you can be fully present in the moment and get in touch with your inner yogi – and do it surrounded by gorgeous gardens on a bluff overlooking the ocean.

What: The goal of the Meditation Gardens, part of a large complex at the southern end of downtown Encinitas dedicated to the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda, is to “inspire you to a greater realization of the Divine Presence that lies within.” Walking up the stone steps into the lush, eclectic gardens imparts an instant feeling of serenity.

There are koi ponds and many quiet nooks with benches where you can sit. At the top of the ocean bluff is a plaque that marks the location of the Golden Lotus Temple. The temple, built in 1937 to take advantage of the incredible views, only stood for five years before the ground gave way and it had to be dismantled. Wander past the old, empty swimming pool up the tree-shrouded path to the “dry” area featuring native plants and succulents overlooking the famed surf spot Swami’s. (The beach’s name was a nod to Yogananda.) Some visitors pray, others meditate.

776,"In the Salt Lake tabernacle Brigham Young built, 360 voices blend with frontier history",Christopher Reynolds,"There’s nothing particularly Mormon, or American, about “Ubi Caritas.” It’s a Gregorian chant at least 11 centuries old, was rearranged by French composer Maurice Duruflé in 1960 and has been sung by church choral groups around the world.

But I can tell you that when it is performed by a certain famous choir in a certain quirky old building in downtown Salt Lake City, that melody works a particular magic.

The voices rise and fall, singing a cappella in Latin. The sound ripples to the back of the hall, guided by the curving plaster ceiling. The final “amen” grows to 10, 15, 20 syllables, each one a slow-motion acrobat in flight.

That’s how it went on a recent Sunday morning at the Salt Lake Tabernacle at Temple Square, a singular American music venue commissioned by Brigham Young and completed in 1867.

The 360 singers who call this building home are known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir — or rather, they were until Oct. 5, when leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renamed them the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square.

In the world beyond these walls, the group has been needled for its squeaky-clean image and song list, and for performing at President Trump’s inauguration.

But the singers are a beloved avatar for the church, offering musical balm for all, backed by their own Twitter feed (since 2009) and YouTube channel (since 2012).

As for the building that houses them, one unimpressed 19th century visitor called it “a pumpkin half-buried in the sand.” To me, as light danced on its aluminum roof, the tabernacle looked like a surfacing submarine.

That shiny roof (a 1947 addition) is a great disguise for a frontier relic and a striking element among the landmark church buildings that make up Temple Square.

The site’s singular history is more than enough reason to eavesdrop on choir practice (most Thursday nights) or to see a broadcast performance (every Sunday morning) or to drop by to hear a pin drop (which happens hourly to show off the hall’s acoustics).

The choir tunes up

A Thursday night rehearsal in the tabernacle, free to the public at 7:30, is a good place to start.

Once you’re inside, look at the choir loft, where choir members will be meandering to their assigned seats, men on one side, women on the other, and making notes on their sheet music.

Chances are that music director Mack Wilberg will be up front with a microphone, delivering complaints, corrections and commendations with a dry wit.

“Ladies, you sound great,” he said. “Men, you’ve got to listen more to the ladies.”

To win a place in this group, singers must belong to the church, be at least 25, no older than 55, and live within 100 miles of Temple Square. Besides an audition, they must pass an interview and music theory test.

For the 1 in 5 applicants who makes the grade, there are hundreds of songs to learn and a year-round schedule of rehearsals, broadcasts, performances, and sometimes recording sessions and tours.

To make way for new blood, once choir members have sung for 20 years or have reached the year of their 60th birthday, they’re out.

Where we go to hear music, across the country »

Teamwork is central. Unlike a lot of show business, singing in the choir is about disappearing into a well-disciplined crowd, a priority that harmonizes with many LDS church teachings.

Oh, and there is no paycheck; all choir members are volunteers. Administration and logistics are handled by a general manager and a paid staff of about a dozen.

Meanwhile, outside Temple Square, ever-more-secular Salt Lake City (population about 200,000) offers ever more entertainment options.

The weekend of my visit, the Utah Symphony was in Abravanel Hall, the Damned were due to play the Depot, and a production of “The Rocky Horror Show” was nearing the end of its run on the Grand Theater stage.

Although the church bans the consumption of alcohol and coffee, brew pubs, coffee houses and even a few distilleries dot the city.

Nobody pictured this in 1847, when the choir first formed under church president Young. The church itself had been founded less than 20 years before by Joseph Smith in upstate New York.

Mormon pioneers had just begun settling in Utah, and the Salt Lake Valley was mostly dry and nearly empty.

Before long, Young was planning a temple (a tall, stone landmark that took 40 years to complete) and the tabernacle, which would be made of Utah pine, about 75 feet tall, 150 feet wide and 250 feet long, capped by a gently curving roof.

The tabernacle rises

Young worked with local architects and a bridge designer to craft one big room with uninterrupted sightlines and lively acoustics so a preacher’s voice could carry. That meant thinking outside the architectural box.

Young eventually chose an oval design, the roof held aloft and shaped by wooden lattice truss arches — a bridge-builder’s trick — held together by iron nails, bolts and wooden pegs above 44 stone piers.

As you walk the aisles, look closely and you’ll see that the builders painted pine columns to look like marble and disguised pine benches to look like oak. (Only in the last 20 years has the church replaced most of the pine benches with genuine oak.)

You’ll also notice the organ — an 11,623-pipe affair that towers behind the choir loft like the bow of a great ship. It isn’t the original but a descendant of one built in the 1860s, using hardware from Boston and pipes carved from more Utah pines.

“Sit in the front row and you hear the music hit you right away,” Stephanie Wood, an 18-year choir member, told me. “You sit in the back row and it feels like it wraps around the building before you hear it.”

Wood sings alto. In the choir loft, she said, there are spots “where you can’t hear really at all. You sit there and you think, ‘I’m singing by myself.’ But you know you’re not.”

The building “just oozes history,” said Matt Harmer, a 54-year-old attorney and father of seven who started singing baritone with the choir this year.

Harmer said he had worried that singing would cut into his skiing, rock-climbing and hiking, but the first time he stood in the tabernacle to sing “Come, Come Ye Saints,” a hymn from the church’s early days, he realized he had chosen well.

“It was very emotional,” he said, “just to have a chance to sing this song that has meant so much to so many people in this faith, in this building that people sacrificed so hard to build.”

Most visitors don’t get invited to climb into the rafters, but if you could (or if you peek at my video), you would see 21st century seismic upgrades alongside rawhide skins, which the pioneers tied around split planks to strengthen them. You would also see thousands of organ pipes, mostly clustered above the stage.

The day I watched, organist Linda Margetts dropped three pins, one by one, and then a nail to show how freely sound travels

Some, known as pioneer pipes, date to the building’s first days and stand as tall as 30 feet, producing tones that seem more seismic than sonic.

And if an organist should start to play loudly while a newcomer is climbing around those pipes — well, let’s just say that for a few moments during my exploration with master keyboard technician Robert Poll, death by bass note seemed a real possibility.

For a less rattling introduction to the building’s acoustics, visitors need only stop in for the tabernacle’s free daily organ recital (noon Mondays-Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays). The pin-drop demonstrations also take place, typically every hour on the hour, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

The day I watched, organist Linda Margetts dropped three pins, one by one, and then a nail — which resounded like a rifle shot — to show how freely sound travels about 170 feet from the stage to the back row.

Then Margetts played, her hands dancing among the instrument’s five keyboards, then pausing while her feet worked the pedals. At one point, tapping out 16th-note triplets, she looked like an Irish dancer, arms at her sides, feet flying.

That was a spectacle I hadn’t expected. But I still hadn’t experienced the full tabernacle choir.

For that, you need an evening performance or a Sunday morning broadcast of the show that made the choir famous.

Lights, camera, choir

“Music & the Spoken Word,” a 30-minute mélange of song, organ music and inspirational narration, began as a radio show in 1929.

By 1949, the choir, which had been recording for decades, was releasing its first commercial album on Columbia Records. By the 1960s, the broadcast was televised, and the choir was singing for presidents, touring the world, and working with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra.

More recent collaborators have included Audra McDonald, Yo-Yo Ma, James Taylor and most recently Kristin Chenoweth, who joined this year’s holiday shows.

On my Sunday morning, I found the choir members decked out in formal wear (men in dark suits and ties, women in beige gowns).

Makeup before Tabernacle Choir performance Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times

The tabernacle’s benches, typically arranged to hold as many as 3,000 listeners, were about two-thirds full. A church hostess warmed up the crowd and welcomed groups from Ecuador, Myanmar and Taiwan — reminders of the church’s global recruitment efforts.

After the countdown to open the broadcast, a narrator welcomed us in fatherly tones and organist Richard Elliott leaned over the keyboards.

Meanwhile, a sophisticated lighting system threw intense colors onto the curving wall behind the choir — sometimes blue, sometimes purple, sometimes red, which made the gold-leaf organ pipes glow like flames.

Several hymns, folk songs and other pieces followed, including “Ubi Caritas.”

In the morning’s spoken interlude, narrator Lloyd D. Newell reminded us that 1.) you shouldn’t let other people’s social media feeds get you down and 2.) “fun and happiness are not the same thing.”

Edgy it was not. But those 360 voices, raised together, were something to hear. I eventually spotted Wood among the altos and Harmer with the baritones.

“I know there are a lot of people who enjoy doing stage productions and they like doing solos, and that’s never been my forte,” Wood had told me. “I have always loved being one of many in creating an amazing sound.”

“You don’t want 360 soloists,” Harmer had said.

In no time, the broadcast was winding up. It ended with the choir’s voices on “God be with you till we meet again” — predictable, perhaps, but warm and comforting on a winter day.

777,"In this Cleveland hall, classical music is king (and ancient Egypt meets the jazz age)",Christopher Reynolds,"Above, the ceiling was done up in silver, beige and blue like frosting on a wedding cake. Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip about what I was about to hear.

“This is going to be something,” said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra’s viola players. “This is a freight train.”

Jackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America’s most admired classical music venues.

This was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.

Conductor Franz Welser-Möst raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.

Inside the hall

When the orchestra’s leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America constructed skyscrapers, Cleveland’s steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.

The city’s population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.

Since then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.

As I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.

A day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall.

First, I found my way to University Circle, the cultural hub about 5 miles east of downtown, where the hall, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the campus of Case Western Reserve University sprawl alongside the grassy expanses of Wade Park.

The art museum was terrific, from the Egyptian mummy cases to the gritty canvases of New York’s Ashcan School. At the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, I got to look a live eagle in the eyes.

The concert hall, however, did not quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall’s Georgian neoclassical exterior is “Pomp and Circumstance” at 23 beats a minute.

But inside, it’s “Rhapsody in Blue” meets “King Tut.” Once you step into the grand foyer, you’re swallowed by a mashup of Art Deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.

It was 1928, Hoy told me, when philanthropists John and Elisabeth Severance pledged $1 million for a project to be designed by Walker & Weeks, a local architecture firm.

Then Elisabeth died at the family winter home in Pasadena, followed by the stock market crash in late 1929. Yet John didn’t hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth’s personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today.

The intricate, lace-like aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth’s wedding dress. Thus, also, the lotus blossoms (her favorite flower) in the grand foyer’s terrazzo floor.

As for the building’s papyrus imagery and other Egyptian Revival touches, John Severance and his family were among the legions of wealthy Americans who journeyed to Egypt in the 1920s to see King Tut’s newly uncovered tomb.

“He really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from,” Hoy told me.

The grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.

Outside the hall

The past 50 years have been rough on Cleveland. The city’s economy stumbled in the 1960s, population began to plummet, crime jumped and the Cuyahoga River, profoundly polluted, caught fire more than once. The slump lasted decades. A wicked nickname emerged: the Mistake by the Lake.

Nowadays, the city’s population is about 390,000; one steel mill remains. But Cleveland — the town that gave us Drew Carey, Halle Berry and Molly Shannon and great sports performances from running back Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns and pitcher Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians— has pivoted.

On the Cuyahoga (no flames since 1969, thank you), you can see kayaks, rowers and the Nautica Queen, a dinner cruise ship.

As downtown reinvents itself, hotels, restaurants and Heinen’s Grocery Store have taken over grand old bank buildings along Euclid Avenue. Condos and apartments are multiplying near the riverside. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Playhouse Square theater district have helped push tourism up by about 25% in the past six years.

And Cleveland’s orchestra? The musicians kept playing, touring and recording, never relinquishing the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.

New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January a New York Times headline proclaimed that “At 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America’s Best.” (A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)

Béla Bartók, Leonard Bernstein, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich — all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.

It remains the orchestra’s home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring. (Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.) The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, the Cleveland Pops Orchestra and other events.

The legacy

On concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue’s fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.

The music began with Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I’m no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.

The hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.

The next piece was Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 — a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.

“He proved that the piano is a percussion instrument,” usher Joette McDonald whispered to me later. She’s been working concerts for 17 years “because I’m never disappointed,” she said. “It never gets old. I do. But it doesn’t.”

After intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev’s third symphony, composed in 1928. Before beginning, Welser-Möst addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us “to listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath.”

Then, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming tympani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending — a beginning as dark and alarming as the night’s first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.

From there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.

At the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.

At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the amps are turned to 11 to get effects like this. In Severance Hall, they do it without amplifiers, in a suit and bow tie, just as they have for 87 years.

More music

Classical music, bread and water are all some people need. But if your appetites range more widely, Cleveland stands ready with rock and polka, beer and pirogis.

First, the rock. Before you step into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a plaque explains the city’s claim on rock history: Alan Freed, a Cleveland disc jockey, popularized the phrase in the early 1950s.

The Hall of Fame opened at the edge of Lake Erie in 1995, relying on an elaborate system of nominations and balloting to celebrate a medium that’s all about anarchy and subversion.

It has thoughtful exhibits and plenty of artifacts. Gawk at Elvis’ double-neck guitar from the early 1960s. Giggle at the 1967 “Arnold Layne” video in which the members of Pink Floyd cavort like the Monkees.

The hall has defined rock so broadly that there’s room for Jay-Z and Taylor Swift. It also has a theater where great performances are screened, including a 2009 Madison Square Garden benefit that featured Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, James Taylor, B.B. King, Patti Smith, Mick Jagger, Metallica and many others.

As for polka, it’s a fixture in Cleveland because of the city’s Polish and Slovenian populations. I got my dose and a few pierogis at the Prosperity Social Club (1109 Starkweather Ave. in the Tremont neighborhood), where accordionist Stan Mejac holds court Wednesday nights.

778,Feel the spirit of country music inside Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. You can even walk on stage,Christopher Reynolds,"This was the heart of Saturday night, and honky-tonk singer-songwriter Whitey Morgan had Ryman Auditorium in an uproar.

Wearing a determined scowl and a long beard, Morgan prowled the stage as if looking for a fight. Now and again he’d let his band, the 78’s, carry the tune while he paused to pull on a bottle of whiskey.

“We’re settin’ here in the Mother Church,” Morgan said, gazing at the colorful Gothic windows at the back. “Come closer and sing with me.”

Down in front, hardcore fans raised their beers in salute. Up in the balcony, they were pounding on the oak pews and flinging fists at the ceiling.

Just outside, Lower Broadway, a.k.a. the Honky Tonk Highway, was teeming with cover bands, club-hoppers and roving bachelorette parties. Two blocks south, Journey and Def Leppard had taken over the 20,000-seat Bridgestone Arena.

In the stadium across the Cumberland River, Taylor Swift was playing to a crowd of more than 50,000. And 11 miles northeast, Garth Brooks was headlining at the 4,400-seat Grand Ole Opry.

Nashville has music the way Willie Nelson has wrinkles. This city of 667,560 has grown so dramatically as a music industry hub, convention venue and tourist destination that if you went by the numbers, the Ryman’s 2,362 seats would make it a minor player.

But it isn’t.

The building went up in 1892. And although it has hosted orchestras, opera singers and distinguished speakers, the Ryman’s distinct character comes from being steeped in six generations of songs about whiskey, love, cars, joy, sorrow, farms, horses, mules, faithful dogs, faithless mates, mountains, hollows, wild flowers and lonesome train whistles.

It was home to the “Grand Ole Opry” radio show for more than 30 years. Now it hosts every stripe of country artist and a smattering of performers of just about every genre but rap.

On this stage, Bill Monroe and his band more or less created bluegrass music in 1945. One night in ’49, lanky newcomer Hank Williams won over the crowd so thoroughly that he was called back for six yodeling encores of “Lovesick Blues.” Johnny Cash first played here in 1956, got banned for bad behavior in 1965, returned to host a TV variety show in 1969-1971 and was mourned at a memorial in 2003.

Now it was Morgan’s turn at the Mother Church of country music. He brandished his guitar like a sidearm and barked happy profanities as he sang of lost souls, dead-end alleys, cocaine and old men who never gave a damn.

This was a honky-tonk crowd, more Harley-Davidson than Stetson, more T-shirt than western wear. When Morgan called them brother truckers — I’m pretty sure that was the phrase — they roared with something like love.

It was a fine moment, and if the people who built this hall weren’t already dead, it might have killed them.

From tabernacle to ‘Grand Ole Opry’

A few days later in the lobby, tour guide Jonathan Brodeur took us back to the 1880s, when the Civil War was a fresh memory and Nashville was about a tenth its current size.

Thomas Ryman was one of the city’s richest men, having built an empire of riverboats with plenty of boozing and gambling.

Then one day in May 1885, Ryman stepped into a big tent where a traveling preacher, the Rev. Sam Jones, had gathered thousands of Nashvillians. Jones launched a tirade against sin, and by the time he was done, the riverboat magnate was ready to repent.

Before long, Jones persuaded Ryman to pay for much of a new building to be shared by local and traveling preachers — a tabernacle to celebrate Nashville’s newfound faith and probity.

The Gothic Revival landmark, designed by architect Hugh Cathcart Thompson, was to be built of brown brick with white trim around its tall, narrow windows. It would have a pulpit surrounded by curving wooden pews, seating thousands of worshipers. And it would stand just a block from the vice and revelry of Lower Broadway.

But what construction project ever went entirely according to plan? Years passed. Money ran low. By the time the tabernacle was completed in 1892, management needed to stage not only religious events but also secular programs, including lectures and music, to pay construction debts.

Before long, those secular shows began to reshape the space.

By 1897, the room had a new balcony, elegantly held aloft by several dozen slender steel columns, principally paid for by a Confederate veterans group. By 1901, the tabernacle’s pulpit had been supplanted by a stage, the better to present opera singers.

By 1914 Ryman and Jones were both dead, and the tabernacle had been renamed Ryman Auditorium. Scheduling was handled by a former bookkeeper named Lula C. Naff, who would last more than 40 years in the job, booking whatever acts might sell, including orchestras, comedians, movies, theatrical productions, the Imperial Russian Ballet, the Hippodrome Circus, Booker T. Washington, Mae West, Helen Keller and W.C. Fields.

Meanwhile, throughout Appalachia, thousands of amateur fiddlers, guitarists, banjo and mandolin players had been mixing European and African instruments, taking church tunes into the world and creating a new sort of music, rural, vital and uniquely American.

Then in 1943, the music met the room. The “Grand Ole Opry” radio show, created in 1925 as a Saturday night celebration of country music and rural life, moved to the Ryman. Despite worries about rowdy crowds, Naff and “Opry” management agreed that the live broadcasts would fill the auditorium just about every Saturday night.

The balcony was mainly paid for by a Confederate veterans group in the late 1800s.

By the mid-1940s, comedian Minnie Pearl was a regular, hollering “Howdy!” and bringing homespun news from the half-fictional hamlet of Grinder’s Switch.

In 1954 Elvis Presley sang Bill Monroe’s “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” got a tepid response and never returned.

In 1957, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered desegregation of the nation’s schools — and three years before many Nashville businesses were willing to integrate — Louis Armstrong played to a Ryman audience that was all white in the balcony, all black in the orchestra level, and targeted by an NAACP boycott.

In 1966, somebody decided that those tall, narrow windows could use some color and added red, yellow, green and blue tints, creating a stained-glass effect that made the space feel twice as ecclesiastical.

But even those who loved the Ryman had to admit that it was ungainly. No private dressing rooms. No air conditioning or elevators. And the surrounding neighborhood was getting seedy.

Mark Ribowsky, author of “Hank: The Short Life and Long Country Road of Hank Williams,” writes that “the hall was cramped and dirty, smelling of urine leaking from stuffed-up bathrooms and sweat.”

“Regularly, patrons would faint and need to be carried out into the lobby just to breathe.”

It got so bad, Ribowksy wrote, that Roy Acuff, a major Nashville power broker and member of the “Opry” since 1938, in 1971 called it a miserable place to perform and said, “I never want another note of music played in that building.”

And sure enough, in 1974 the “Opry” fled to a bigger, custom-built hall, 11 miles northeast of downtown — but first, workers cut out a circle from the Ryman stage to install at the new venue to signal continuity.

The Ryman, apparently doomed, languished for nearly 20 years.

‘At the Ryman’

By the time Emmylou Harris and the Nash Ramblers recorded a live album there in 1991, the structure was so iffy that no one was allowed to sit on or beneath the balcony.

That left only about 200 usable seats, but Harris did three shows, savoring the chance to “feel the hillbilly dust” and dance on stage with 79-year-old Bill Monroe. The resulting record and documentary, “At the Ryman” (1992), rallied public support for the rescue and restoration of the old hall.

In 1992 the building’s owner, now known as Ryman Hospitality Partners, announced plans for major renovations. In 1994 the auditorium reopened and a new era dawned.

Today the Ryman hosts about 200 shows a year, including visits from the “Grand Ole Opry” every winter and occasional church services and funerals. About 250,000 people a year book tours. The escorted version runs about 40 minutes, takes you through dressing rooms and onto the stage, and costs about $35.

And on stage, the story continues to unfold. In April 2017 Loretta Lynn marked her 85th birthday by performing a pair of sold-out Ryman shows.

Five months later, 23-year-old pop singer Harry Styles , formerly of One Direction, made his Ryman debut, telling the audience: “When we booked this tour, this was kind of the reason. This room.”

In August, as Morgan rollicked toward the end of his gig, he was just as reverent about the room but gruffer. He even bowed to history by covering favorites from Roger Miller and John Prine.

Then Morgan went back to his own lyrics, celebrating sinning, whiskey and just about everything that the Ryman’s builders wanted to wipe from this world. Behind him, the 78’s rocked ruggedly enough to offend any “Opry” purist.

In other words, the Ryman has been soiled. And saved. And my first night there was —cover your ears, Rev. Jones — a hell of a show.

779,Looking for the best Chicago blues? Try these clubs where guitars howl and harmonicas growl,Christopher Reynolds,"“Dancing Aloud,” a sign said. On stage, guitarist Corey Dennison, 43, white and well tattooed, had just opened an instrumental conversation with a grandfatherly figure in a White Sox cap.

“This is my old man, Mr. Carl Weathersby ,” Dennison told the crowd. “He taught me everything I know about the blues.”

Weathersby, 65, and African American, nodded. The notes rose, fell and tangled like family voices around a dinner table. The players, related only by a passion for music, grinned and winced the way soloists do.

In the audience 100 blues lovers roared, clapped, drank and chattered in three or four languages.

This was Kingston Mines, the oldest, biggest club of its kind in Chicago, on a recent Monday night. Like the rest of the international audience, I was here to listen to an embattled American sound — Chicago-style electric blues, born in the mid-20th century as African American families moved north from the Mississippi Delta.

In that migration, legions of country blues musicians traded their acoustic guitars for electrics, started playing their harmonicas through microphones and launched an era of rough-edged, streetwise music, sibling to soul, cousin to gospel.

The sound filled mostly black clubs on Chicago’s south and west sides. New arrivals played for tips on Maxwell Street, and the biggest names released albums on Chess Records and blazed a musical path that rock ’n’ roll soon would follow.

But Chicago and pop culture have moved on. Though the vast, free Chicago Blues Festival takes over Millennium Park every June, and the locally headquartered Delmark and Alligator labels release new blues and roots tunes, rap music now dominates the South and West sides.

You must go to the Loop and north, where the tourists are, to find the remaining handful of all-blues clubs.

I wanted to see and hear them before things changed any more, so I spent three days and nights this summer chasing Chicago blues through five clubs, one museum exhibition and one storied old studio.

“It’s just real” Corey Dennison

Kingston Mines, born in the late 1960s and a fixture on Halsted Street in Lincoln Park since 1982, was my first stop.

Although the surrounding neighborhood is collegiate, urban and prosperous, the club aims for a rural juke-joint feel, with fried okra and catfish fingers on the menu, a map of “blues country” on the wall and tangles of Christmas lights here and there. It’s too big to be called intimate, too gritty to be mistaken for a House of Blues .

It features two stages (so two bands can alternate sets without long delays in between) and a kitchen (Doc’s Rib Joint). The live music plays until about 3:45 a.m. every night except Saturday into Sunday when it lasts an hour longer.

“There’s pretty much no place I know like this on the planet,” said Joanna Connor, a singer and guitarist who has played at the club for more than 30 years.

“It’s just real, man. It’s real people,” Dennison told me.

Dr. Lenin Pellegrino, a general practitioner and social crusader, owned the club for decades, relying on an audience that’s a mix of locals, tourists and students from nearby DePaul University . “Doc” Pellegrino died in May at age 92. His grown children run the club.

“It’s an integrating force,” manager Lisa Pellegrino told me. “We have people sitting here who, back home, their countries are at war.”

As I chatted with the musicians between sets, I learned how Weathersby broke in as a guitarist for bluesmen Albert King and Billy Branch, started his own group, then hired Dennison and mentored him for years.

Nowadays Dennison and his band play two nights a week at Kingston Mines. Weathersby, who has moved out of state, had dropped by to listen.

As in all the clubs I checked out, the monthly schedule showed a mix of black and white performers, mostly homegrown. The audiences were probably less than 10% black and included a lot of blues-hungry visitors from Europe and Asia.

More than once, I thought of a question Chicago Tribune music critic Howard Reich posed in 2011: “How long can a black musical art form remain dynamic when presented to a largely white audience in settings designed to replicate and merchandise the real thing?”

I have no answer. But the music, done right, still thrills. Stories of loss and longing. Bursts of wild exhilaration. Moments of understanding that reach beyond age and race.

“It’s electric folk music,” Bruce Iglauer, the Chicago-based founder of Alligator Records, told me. “And folk music changes as the folks change.”

Whatever the future, there is plenty of blues culture to see and hear this year in the city. At the Chicago History Museum, I browsed through the “Amplified: Chicago Blues” exhibition (through Aug. 10, 2019), which includes vintage photos of wild nights in long-gone South Side clubs; hands-on features inviting you to sing or play guitar (with the amp’s distortion level set to good ’n’ crunchy); and an introduction to many of the region’s key players.

From Mississippi came Muddy Waters to sing “Mannish Boy,” Howlin’ Wolf to sing “Smokestack Lightnin’,” Bo Diddley to lay down the five-beat syncopated rhythm that drives “Who Do You Love?,” Willie Dixon to write “Hoochie Coochie Man” and shape the Chicago blues scene for years as a bassist and producer.

From Tennessee came Koko Taylor to sing “Wang Dang Doodle.” From Louisiana came harmonica player Little Walter and guitarist Buddy Guy, now 82 and still performing at his club, Buddy Guy’s Legends.

A heaping of history

My other daytime stop was Willie Dixon’s Blues Heaven Foundation, a surprisingly compact building that housed Chess Records from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. There, tour guide Janine Judge led me upstairs to the studio where Waters, Diddley, Taylor and Dixon did some of their best work.

This was also where Chuck Berry recorded “Johnny B. Goode” in 1958 and Etta James recorded “At Last” in 1960; where the Rolling Stones recorded a smoldering instrumental track titled “2120 South Michigan Avenue” in 1964 while on their first U.S. tour.

Judge, carrying a portable speaker, cranked up the volume on classic songs and pointed out the late Dixon’s old bass in one corner.

She explained how brothers Leonard and Phil Chess built the label and how Dixon sued Led Zeppelin decades ago, accusing the band of using his words and music in the songs “Bring It on Home” and “Whole Lotta Love.” This led to settlement payments, amount undisclosed. Without that cash, who knows whether this building would still be standing?

By night I club-hopped, paying cover charges of $5 to $12.

At B.L.U.E.S. on Halsted, down the street from Kingston Mines, I stepped in just as host Big Ray was asking the out-of-towners where they were from (England, Hungary, Australia).

The club, snug and narrow, holds about 60 people. The stage was so small that the bass player sat on the keyboard of an upright piano.

This bar is known for musicians often sitting in — “more jamming, more surprises,” Iglauer said — and many a music lover has spent an evening wandering back and forth between B.L.U.E.S. and Kingston Mines.

At Rosa’s Lounge the scene is similarly intimate, and the hospitality has a homespun Italian inflection. Italian immigrant (and drummer) Tony Mangiullo opened the place in 1984, and it’s been a fixture in the Logan Square neighborhood.

I showed up on a slow weekday night — fewer than 10 customers were inside and nobody on the street outside. On stage, Nigel Mack, a singer and multi-instrumentalist, was working without his usual guitarist. That meant we didn’t get the harmonica heroics Mack is known for, but I was happy to sit up close and admire his slide guitar work.

The city’s blues scene “goes up and it goes down,” Mack told me during a break. “But the state of the blues has got to be healthier here than it is anywhere else in the world.”

At Buddy Guy’s Legends, a posh place next to the Hilton in the South Loop, I caught Mz Peachez and Her Casanovas.

If I were smarter, I’d have arrived early enough to order dinner —those who reserve ahead and sit to eat get the best spots. While I stood in back, Mz Peachez assessed her crowd and veered from standard blues titles to disco favorites “Bad Girls” and “I Will Survive.”

Maybe a few purists were offended, but dozens of Brazilian tourists jumped out of their seats to dance. (I’m guessing that medley doesn’t happen in January, when Guy himself usually does a month-long residency.)

At the House of Blues in the heavily touristed River North area, I was too early for live music but got a juicy burger with sweet potato fries. To those who would say that patronizing the House of Blues in Chicago is like eating at Taco Bell in Los Angeles, I can only say: Yes, it is. But it books a lot of local blues acts, often two per night.

On my last night in town, I circled back to Kingston Mines, where Dennison again was prowling the stage, singing Willie Nelson’s lyrics about how “the nightlife ain’t no good life, but it’s my life.”

Weathersby was in the audience again, this time in a Cubs hat.

“The things that blues are about — they aren’t going away as long as there’s people,” he told me. With players such as Dennison on the scene, Weathersby added, “It’s in good hands for another 20 years.”

Then up on stage, his protégé invited him to sit in, and the guitars started talking.

780,Sitting in the palm of nature: The unique energy — and performances — of Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre,Christopher Reynolds,"It was a half-cloudy night at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, with boulders looming and distant lightning in the eastern sky. Singer Colin Meloy was on stage with the Decemberists, chatting up the audience.

“There are very few places to play in the world that still make me nervous, and this is one of them,” said Meloy, who has been touring for almost 20 years. “It feels like we should be giving a talk on grizzly bear management.”

Red Rocks, 16 miles southwest of downtown Denver, is an American outdoor music venue like no other.

The stage and audience areas are sheltered between a pair of 300-foot monoliths, Ship Rock and Creation Rock, and another boulder anchored behind the stage bounces sound forward. Whether you’re in the audience or on stage, occupying Red Rocks is like being held in the palm of a vast sandstone hand.

I recently caught two shows here and spent several more hours exploring the trails, slopes and meadows of Red Rocks Park, which covers 966 acres.

If you are a sonic purist, this might not be your place — too many visual distractions. But for the rest of us, it’s a double thrill.

In the rocks you see nature improvising over the slow click-track of the long geological clock. On stage, there’s a human invention every moment.

And every once in a while, human and natural events align in startling ways.

In a video at the venue visitor center, Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools recalls the day Red Rocks audience members roared their approval when he was in the middle of a song. Just as he was congratulating himself, he glanced up and realized that the fans were cheering a double rainbow overhead.

Beyond the venue

Show up at dawn, when the early light plays on the boulders, and the only music you’ll hear at Red Rocks is birdsong.

Still, you won’t be alone. Besides the 1.3 million concertgoers it drew last year, Red Rocks also attracted an estimated 1.2 million tourists and hikers who never heard a note.

The park opens daily an hour before sunrise, and if there’s no show that night it stays open until an hour after sunset. (The performance season is April through October.)

Fitness buffs huff and puff up and down the amphitheater aisles all year long, and wise ones keep their eyes open. Skunks, rattlesnakes and deer appear regularly.

On show days — which is almost every day in summer— the venue closes to visitors in early afternoon. But the trails stay busy, especially the Trading Post Trail.

Lou Spirito For The Times

That route covers 1.4 mostly flat miles through foliage and around rock formations. I encountered no critters on the path in the middle of a spring weekday, but I had plenty of human company, including Jennifer Forsha, a Littleton, Colo., resident who hikes the rocks almost every weekend with her husband and two kids.

“We run up the trail and we run up the amphitheater,” she said. “You see all this beautiful stuff. And if you go up to the amphitheater, it’s a bunch of amazing energy.… It’s my happy place.”

We’ll never know who first made music among the boulders. But historians say the site was a longtime gathering point for native people. And we know that by 1906, a promoter named John Brisben Walker had bought the property, named it the Garden of the Titans and set up a wooden platform.

If you go up to the amphitheater, it’s a bunch of amazing energy.… It’s my happy place.” Jennifer Forsha

Pietro Satriano and his 25-piece brass band played that May. Five years later, soprano Mary Garden sang opera.

In years to follow, Walker staged all sorts of events in the area and built a funicular railway, later scrapped.

The city of Denver acquired the amphitheater site in 1927, and architect Burnham Hoyt came up with the plans. Civilian Conservation Corps workers, grateful for work in the middle of the Great Depression, started swinging picks and shovels in 1936 or 1937, often earning $1 per day.

By 1941, the workers had sculpted the space between Ship and Creation rocks into 70 rows for wooden benches, the aisles flanked by juniper trees. Then, as now, there was room for about 9,500 people.

The rock amphitheater outside of Denver is a music venue and a place to hike.

The visitor center, open to concertgoers and sightseers alike, was added in 2007. There’s room for the Ship Rock Grille and a Red Rocks artists’ hall of fame. There’s also a Colorado Music Hall of Fame in the Trading Post building, with a bronze statue in front of — did you guess it? — John Denver.

Meanwhile, performers enjoy dressing rooms built around rock formations. In the tunnel between the sound-mixing board and backstage, generations of musicians have made their marks. (Styx, it seems, travels with a stencil.)

Through the early 1950s, the schedule was short and dominated by classical music, opera and ballet, with each season opened by an Easter sunrise service.

Then pop culture crept in.

By the late 1950s, Jerry Lewis was doing stand-up, Ella Fitzgerald was scat-singing and Ricky Nelson was playing. Ray Charles appeared in 1962 but did such a short, slapdash show that the audience pelted the stage with beer cans and management briefly imposed an alcohol ban.

The Beatles played in 1964 (leaving about 2,500 tickets unsold at $6.60 each). Jimi Hendrix came in 1968. When Jethro Tull appeared in 1971, legions of ticket-less fans tried to breach a fence, security forces let loose with tear gas and a five-year rock ’n’ roll ban began.

By the late ’70s, the amphitheater was again busy with rock and just about every other genre. In 1978 Steve Martin brought down the house with “King Tut,” a performance audible on his album “A Wild and Crazy Guy.”

Five years later, a young U2 played amid fog and rain, a show featured in the film “U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky.”

Ani DiFranco has sung about reproductive freedom here, John Tesh about God. The Moody Blues crooned “Nights in White Satin” with the Colorado Symphony providing full orchestral pomp. On April 20, 2014, Red Rocks began its day with an Easter sunrise service and ended with a Snoop Dogg show.

“I did 37 shows last year,” usher Ben Miller, 33, told me one night. “Every show definitely does have a different energy to it.” His favorite performance: the alternative band Gorillaz last September.

“It was raining most of the time, but sometimes that makes a better show,” Miller said.

If you sit in Row 33 or higher, you can see the horizon beyond the stage, but it sometimes gets windy. Lightning or hail occasionally forces a delay or cancellation. And because the stage is about 6,450 feet above sea level, performers sometimes come up short of breath. The crew keeps oxygen canisters backstage.

High-energy music

Don’t miss the year-by-year timeline of performers when you browse the visitor center. You’ll notice that the venue gets busier as the economy booms and slower when it slumps (the early 1990s and late 2000s, for instance). As recently as 2012, the Red Rocks performance year included just 78 concerts.

But it’s booming now, with 161 nights booked for this year— including about 30 nights of EDM — electronic dance music. Just as jam bands such as the Grateful Dead, Blues Traveler and Widespread Panic played a key role at Red Rocks in the ’90s and ’00s, EDM shows have multiplied lately. In fact, those shows’ thundering bass lines have prompted new volume limits.

“The crowd is very high energy,” Miller told me. “There’s a lot of drug use.”

When I asked Red Rocks spokesman Brian Kitts about that, he suggested that every new generation of pop music seems to provoke a similar set of complaints. In the larger picture, he said, “I have a hard time believing that having EDM is any different than having Metallica on stage.”

Just my luck — I missed EDM and Metallica. But I did catch Phantogram, a rock band that favors electronica, often slips into spacey dance grooves and uses lots of light effects and projections. In short, this was a marijuana-friendly band. (Though weed is banned from the amphitheater, enforcement is imperfect.) The house was packed, happy and mostly younger than 30.

There are very few places to play in the world that still make me nervous, and this is one of them.” Colin Meloy

I returned the next night for the Decemberists. It was a smaller crowd, mostly older than 30 and many older than 50, like me. But from the opening notes of “Everything Is Awful” — the band’s first song — it was a happy night.

I joined in when the audience rose and started calling for an encore. For a long neo-tribal moment we all stood clapping, glancing at each other, the boulders and the sky.

Then the band was back, dragging a mysterious canister. Meloy pointed at it. “We’ve got enough oxygen for one more!” he shouted.

Near Red Rocks

Stroll tiny downtown Morrison (population about 430), which lies two miles southeast of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Have a look at Bear Creek, see the old white Morrison Chapel and browse the shops along Bear Creek Avenue, the main street.

Try breakfast or lunch at the Cow an Eatery. Before you head to a show at Red Rocks, maybe have a game dinner at the Fort.

Also, stop in at the Buffalo Bill Museum & Grave on Lookout Mountain, which celebrates the life and times of outdoorsman and showman Buffalo Bill Cody (1846-1917). The museum features Wild West show posters and artifacts. As for the gift shop— you’ve never seen so many refrigerator magnets.

Golden, 8 miles north of the amphitheater, is another worthwhile town near Red Rocks. It’s best known for the Coors Brewery, and, yes, there are tours.

But you may prefer to walk Washington Street and admire the “Howdy Folks!” sign overhead. Check out the path along Clear Creek, where there are often kayakers. Try the pizza at Woody’s Wood-Fired Pizza. If you like, eat it at a picnic table on the bridge over Clear Creek.

The Origin Hotel is supposed to open by the end of the summer. Rates start at $212, dipping to $169 in November. (It was still a construction site when I visited.)

784,"Texas once had 1,000 dance halls. Now there’s a rush to save those that remain",Molly Hennessy-Fiske,"As she watched couples in cowboy boots whirl across the dance hall her ancestors built in 1879 — the place where she played as a child, met her husband, married off her son and taught her grandchildren to two-step — Jo Nell Haas despaired.

Twin Sisters Dance Hall used to draw people by the hundreds. In the early days, families came from surrounding farms on horseback to waltz Saturday night away under kerosene lamps. Children played in the nursery out back heated by wood stoves. Elders supervised young dancers from the “buzzard’s nest,” a platform near the entrance, ensuring they didn’t get too familiar.

Lyndon B. Johnson is believed to have danced at Twin Sisters growing up. Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Grammy winner Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys pioneered western swing from the narrow stage.

But on a recent Saturday, only about 20 people had arrived in time for the first dance of the night.

“This is not hardly anybody,” Haas, 61, said as she staffed the door, hoping to sell a few more tickets. The sparse crowd was greeted by a sign advertising the night’s country band, Caliche Crossroads, and their motto: “Keep Texas Two-Steppin’.”

In 140 years, Twin Sisters has never stopped hosting dances. But it’s come close. And Haas fears it could go the way of hundreds of other dance halls, Texas traditions that survived the 19th and 20th centuries only to shutter in the 21st.

The German immigrants who built it by hand named the hall Twin Sisters, Tanzsaal der Zwillinsschwestern, after a pair of surrounding hills. The club created to run it was chartered with one condition: monthly dances. Men — and later women — paid a nominal fee to join and bring their families. Even during the World Wars and Vietnam, when other halls went quiet, the dancing never stopped at Twin Sisters.

Like Twin Sisters, dance halls across the state were built by immigrants: Czech, Polish and Swiss, as well as Mexicans, who created conjunto music, an accordion-driven polka hybrid. Many towns once supported multiple halls, and in some parts of Texas it was common to hear more German than English.

But over time crowds dwindled as descendants died or moved away. Bands became expensive. In recent years, the cedar shingle roof at Twin Sisters started to leak. The pine plank floor threatened to buckle.

“This hall almost died,” Haas said.

The former day-care director had learned to dance there, like many locals, “at her grandfather’s feet,” and decided she had to save the hall. Five years ago, she successfully ran as the first female president of the hall club, and contacted Austin-based Texas Dance Hall Preservation Inc. for advice.

Deb Fleming, the nonprofit’s president, showed her how to apply for nonprofit status and private grants that saved the roof. Haas learned to find more affordable bands and to alternate dances with nearby halls to ensure a crowd. She enlisted her husband to tend bar, her two daughters’ families to clean the grounds and to raise funds.

Still, Haas has kept calling the nonprofit for tips.

“There was many nights I called them in the middle of a dance and said, ‘I don’t know what to do — it’s horrible,’” Haas said. “It’s scary, our country’s losing so much history.”

Spring is dance hall season in central Texas’ Hill Country, a time for festivals, weddings and fundraisers before the summer heat descends. The state once filled about 1,000 dance halls. Now there are about 400 the Austin nonprofit is trying to save.

Some halls are abandoned, others overgrown with weeds. Some have simply fallen apart, like Double Bayou Hall east of Houston (part of the blues Chitlin’ Circuit) or Helvetia Hall north of Austin, which Fleming said, “melted into the ground.”

In an effort to save halls, Austin singer Ray Benson and his band, Asleep at the Wheel, stage monthly tours with stops at Twin Sisters and a handful of others. Erik McCowan, a dance hall aficionado, hosts day-long “Dance Hall Road Trip” tours and last year released “Dance Hall Days,” a documentary about the halls.

On Saturday, his tour stopped at what German settlers dubbed Katzenquelle, or Wildcat Spring. The local Turn Verein Hall — which doubled as a gym — closed in the 1940s, but the community renovated another nearby venue, the Cat Spring Agricultural Society Hall.

James Herring recently walked through the 12-sided building, explaining how he helped restore the 14-foot pine beams supporting the massive cupola built in 1902.

Herring, 81, director of the agricultural society, grew up speaking German until he started school. A hand-painted wooden sign warns visitors in German, “The wearing of the hat & the spurs, the smoking & the chewing is in this hall forbidden.”

“The ladies had these big hoop dresses and the spurs would catch on them,” said Herbert Kollatschny, 82, who grew up dancing at the hall.

“And the hat — they used to carry six-shooters under them,” Herring added.

Herring’s father played here with a polka band (clarinet and saxophone), and so did Herring (coronet and trumpet). Kollatschny, whose family was Czech, would drive around before dances to pick up friends in neighboring villages like New Ulm and Sealy, who shouted to their mothers as they left that they were going to the taneční hala, the dance hall.

“That’s the only thing I knew in Czech, other than a few cuss words,” he chuckled.

The dance hall tours also stop at halls being restored by their builders’ descendants. Families have invested tens of thousands in the halls, such as the Reo Palm Isle in East Texas where Elvis played, to Hye Hall near Blanco. It was on the porch of the Hye Hall Post Office that President Lyndon B. Johnson, raised nearby, swore in the new postmaster in 1965.

Jason Cook converted the post office into a restaurant bustling with weekend tourists, and is restoring the pressed-tin-sided dance hall across the street with help from Oliver Deike, whose family ran the place after it was built in 1915.

Deike, who also danced at Twin Sisters, had used Hye Hall for storage, and it fell into such disrepair that he couldn’t insure it. Damp seeped through the 37 plank shutters, the floor warped and the elements faded the sign painted out front: “Next Dance Saturday.”

Now the hall has been cleaned, painted a lush green. The stage has been rebuilt, the floors refinished. The hall’s first event was Saturday: Cook’s wedding reception.

“We’re looking forward to having tastings and dances here, a true community hall,” said his wife, Karen Cook.

To the east in Columbus, Amber Becerra’s family had closed Schneider Hall when the men left to fight World War II, then used it as a hay barn until her younger sister requested they restore it for her wedding in 2010. Becerra’s mother then ran the hall for three years until she was killed in a car accident. Unwilling to see the hall her mother loved close, Becerra quit her job and became the event coordinator. In 2014 she, too, was married at the open-air hall.

Becerra’s ancestors had hosted public dances, allowing guests to park their Model Ts on the lawn, while selling burgers, Dr Pepper and beers like Schlitz and Pearl from an outdoor “soda joint.”

But times have changed. Schneider Hall now hosts graduation parties, baby showers, weddings and quinceaneras. Becerra, who has purple highlights and a penchant for leggings, doesn’t do dances — she worries about security. At a recent wedding, guests ignored her rule against sparklers, and one landed in a 100-year-old live oak, igniting Spanish moss and almost setting the hall on fire.

The hall’s gray cypress walls are more than a landmark to Becerra: They’re living history.

As she set up for a wedding, the air perfumed by a gardenia she planted at the door after her mother died, Becerra pointed to scribbles inside the ticket booth, her great-great-aunt’s penciled calculations.

On another wall, her grandmother had scrawled “Laura loves/likes Joe K.” She died before the hall was restored and Joe’s identity remains a mystery (Becerra’s grandfather’s name was Chester).

She considers it a responsibility to maintain the halls for the next generation, including her 3-year-old daughter, Laurel, named after her grandmother.

“Dancing, like everything else, it will come back around,” she said. “As long as you keep things viable.”

Over at Twin Sisters, Jo Nell Hass is trying to do just that.

The hall’s ceiling, an arched wonder painted robin’s egg blue, is leaking again. She’s hoping to raise money to restore it and to re-create two cypress cupolas that once crowned the hall.

She applied for grants to add story boards outside and to preserve the hall’s “grand drape,” a hand-painted canvas stage curtain featuring a country cottage, surrounded by the names of local businesses.

It’s a rare piece of history, lost at many other halls but preserved here by chance. Twin Sisters is no longer a town, long ago absorbed by neighboring Blanco, but some of the shops on the drape still exist, like Boling Café and Devil’s Back Bone Tavern.

In addition to monthly dances, the hall has recently hosted proms and quinceaneras, hoping to attract a younger crowd. This spring Haas held an under 21 “Hot Texas Swing” dance with lessons that attracted about 30 people from Austin. Now Haas is organizing a September fundraising fiesta, including Native American dancers, a salsa team and mariachi band from Texas State University in San Marcos.

“We’ve tried to embrace as much culture as we can,” she said, “because if we don’t have our youth involved, we’re going to lose these halls.”

Haas holds dances the first Saturday of every month, with country bands and a food truck. Her husband, Joe, runs the bar, which serves Shiner, Lone Star and other beer, but doesn’t have a liquor license (veteran dancers know to BYOB).

Despite Haas’ worries on a recent Saturday, by night’s end the dance floor had filled with guests of all ages, including youths and a trio of women who took Uber from San Antonio. So many couples swirled across the floor to “Amarillo by Morning” and stomped their way through “Cotton Eyed Joe” that Haas had to sprinkle the planks with wax to keep it smooth.

Michelle Boop brought her entire family: husband, two children, two grandsons and a gaggle of friends, all at her teenage daughter’s urging. They recently moved from elsewhere in central Texas to an old farmhouse up the road, where her husband worked as a ranch manager.

“Just imagine, a hundred years ago people used to come down from the house to dance here,” said Boop, 47, who, like her husband, grew up dancing at other halls.

She lingered closer than the buzzard’s nest, keeping an eye on the teenagers, who were forbidden to dance too close or to “inappropriate” songs, such as “Gettin’ You Home.” But she also danced to many songs with her husband, Bill.

Bill Boop, 46, alternately twirled his grandsons and 17-year-old daughter, McKenzie. She squealed in delight, then took to the floor with three classmates, executing a clunky two-step.

After the last song at midnight, “Beer, Bait and Ammo,” the band started to pack up, and Haas tallied her receipts. In total, 80 customers, a decent turnout, especially because some were first-timers like the ladies from San Antonio.

“This hall holds the roots,” she said. “People come back looking for that.”

On July 6, she expects several hundred dancers to come see country singer Gary P. Nunn’s retirement tour. Fans from as far as Dallas were already phoning her about tickets.

785,He voted for Trump. Now he and his wife raise their son from opposite sides of the border,Jenny Jarvie,"She is there when he wakes up, telling him she loves him and helping him coax their son, Ashton, to finish his Honey Nut Cheerios before the school bus whisks him to kindergarten.

She is there when he is at work delivering UPS packages, and she’s there to greet their 6-year-old when he gets home from school, bounces up and down the stairs, and pulls the arms and legs of his Stretch Force Fireman.

Yet Jason Rochester’s wife, Cecilia, is not really there.

Her dark-brown eyes gaze out of a slick iPad screen and her voice floats through a tiny hole in the side of the machine.

I can’t sleep. I keep waking up every hour.

What are you wearing today, Ashton? Shorts or pants?

Papi, I want to see you. Can you stay in front of the camera?... Come on.

Forced apart by President Trump’s stringent immigration policies, Jason Rochester and Cecilia Gonzalez have spent the last 16 months raising their 6-year-old son from opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Like so many separated families, the couple have experienced the years of Trump’s presidency as a grim journey of restless nights and tearful goodbyes. But unlike many in their predicament, Jason voted for Trump.

He knew Trump planned to get tough on immigration — building a wall and deporting drug dealers, rapists and killers. He never imagined anyone would consider his sweet stay-at-home wife a “bad hombre.”

A white delivery driver born and raised in the tiny Alabama town of Smiths Station, Jason, 43, is a laid-back evangelical Christian, and the kind of man who takes the time to ask a customer how her baby carriage turned out and coo over its color.

About 15 years ago, a few years after he moved to the northern suburbs of Atlanta, he met Cecilia at work as he began a shift unloading packages.

She was petite — at 5-foot-4, just an inch shorter than him, with big brown eyes. He was instantly smitten.

Los Angeles Times

Whenever he spotted her tugging at a heavy box, he would haul the package off the semitrailer.

Day after day, they sat together on their 15-minute breaks, sharing pizza and chicken wings. Sometimes he would bring her dandelions from the side of the road. Occasionally she let him rub her shoulders.

But she didn’t offer much about her background — all he knew was she was from somewhere near Guadalajara, Mexico — and after two years he had failed to persuade her out on a date.

Eventually, a Mexican co-worker told him: “She’s illegal.”

He didn’t care.

When they eventually started dating, Cecilia told him that she had crossed the border into California several times in her early 20s. Immigration officials had caught her twice, first after crossing in Calexico and then in San Ysidro.

“Why would you want to be with me, knowing I’m like that?” she asked.

“I love you for who you are,” he told her.

After a year of dating, Jason proposed. They got married in his uncle’s backyard. Then came Ashton. Cecilia gave up her job cleaning hotels and settled into life as a stay-at-home mom in this affluent Atlanta suburb, making Ashton pancakes and grits for breakfast and taking him for strolls to the local park.

“You’re not a criminal,” Jason tried to reassure her. “You don’t have to worry about it.”

Jason had faith that the Trump administration would distinguish between good and bad immigrants. Cecilia had never even gotten a traffic ticket.

“In my mind, bad hombres were people who did bad things,” he said. “We figured that he was going to get rid of the people we didn’t want.”

So he voted for Trump, assuring himself and his wife that the ultimate decision was in God’s hands.

A few days after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that expanded Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s focus to most of the 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, regardless of whether they had a criminal record.

From the beginning, Cecilia eyed Donald Trump warily.

It was clear he never had anything good to say about immigrants, at least not anyone from her country.

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” Trump said in 2015 when he announced his presidential bid. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems.… They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

Jason didn’t like much of what Trump said on immigration either.

An independent voter who leans conservative, he voted for Barack Obama in 2008, hoping he would fix the immigration system and make it easier for Cecilia to pursue citizenship.

But this time, immigration was not his main concern.

Jason listened to conservative Christian radio, and his favorite talking heads, like James Dobson, the evangelical psychologist who founded Focus on the Family, convinced him that electing Trump would lead to a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.

Cecilia urged him to pay attention to Trump’s vows to build a wall along the southern border and amass a huge “deportation force.”

Jason told Cecilia not to worry, that the government wasn’t interested in her.

But she became increasingly fearful, scanning Univision broadcasts and local Facebook pages and showing him stories of people picked up by “la migra” when they were leaving for work or walking their kids to the school bus.

As immigration arrests surged, Cecilia became afraid to take Ashton to the park. She stopped driving. Her hair fell out in thick clumps.

What would happen if they came for her? Cecilia wondered. If they asked for her papers?

For the last few years, the couple had met with ICE once a year to renew Cecilia’s work permit. Under the Obama administration, ICE granted renewable work permits to many law-abiding immigrants who had been in the country at least five years.

But with their next appointment in November 2017, Jason and Cecilia had to decide: Should she go and risk being deported? Or should they skip the meeting, risking the possibility that ICE agents might knock on their door?

Ashton was 4. More than anything, Cecilia wanted to spare him the trauma of watching her be hauled away.

They decided to go to the ICE appointment with a plane ticket and a plan. If you allow us to spend Christmas and New Year’s together, they told the immigration agent, Cecilia would self-deport in January.

They were not sure it would work. As they waited at a cubicle, a woman sobbed as she was given a few moments to say goodbye to her young children. But the ICE agent agreed.

So they roasted a beef tenderloin over Thanksgiving and piled presents under the tree at Christmas. After New Year’s, Jason and Ashton flew with Cecilia to Guadalajara and took an Uber to her family’s home in the rural town of Juanacatlán.

It was Jason’s first time in Mexico and he was shocked by the poverty of her hometown. Stray dogs roamed the dirt roads, and mosquitoes buzzed inside homes with no air conditioning or drinkable tap water. Locals ran tiendas inside their rundown homes.

Unbelievable to him, there was no McDonald’s or Walmart.

Until then, Jason had not really grasped why his wife took the risk of crossing the border for a better life.

But God wanted his family to be together, he felt sure. Eventually, immigration officials would consider that Cecilia was married to an American citizen and had a child in the U.S.

“Mommy will be home soon,” he promised Ashton.

Not long after Jason got back to the U.S., their attorney told him Cecilia was permanently barred from returning.

It should not have been a surprise — Cecilia had lived in the U.S. for nearly two decades after being caught twice illegally crossing the border — but Jason was crushed when the lawyer said there was nothing more she could do. They would have to wait 10 years before they could ask for permission to reapply to enter the country.

Jason could not imagine Cecilia living in Juanacatlán, so they decided she should move to Mérida, the capital of Yucatán state and known as one of Mexico’s safest major cities. Jason’s mother moved from Alabama to Georgia to help care for Ashton.

In the summer, Ashton would visit Cecilia while Jason tried to figure out how to bring her back.

But there was a setback in July, not long after Ashton arrived in Mérida.

Cecilia was rubbing lotion on Ashton when she noticed a protrusion under his rib cage. After snapping a picture and texting it to Jason, she took Ashton to a hospital.

Ashton had a Wilms tumor, a cancerous mass in his left kidney the size of a cantaloupe. Jason flew to Mexico and rushed Ashton back to the U.S. for treatment.

After surgery to remove Ashton’s kidney, there was radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Ashton screamed every time he had blood taken.

“Why isn’t mommy here?” he asked.

“The government doesn’t want her here,” Jason tried to explain. “Mommy messed up years ago and we’re trying to get her back.”

Frantic, Cecilia considered trying to cross the border again. But Jason urged her to follow the law. God will reward us, he said.

They applied for humanitarian parole, assuming everything would be resolved in a few days. Even the most hard-hearted immigration official, they figured, would make an exception for a 5-year-old with cancer.

Nearly two months passed before they got word: Parole was denied.

As a white Trump voter, Jason makes an unlikely immigration activist.

He refers to immigrants as “illegals,” a term many advocates consider dehumanizing. He is indifferent about Trump’s “big, beautiful wall.” He suggests immigrants who have lived in the country without authorization should pay $10,000 fines.

But watching Cecilia miss walking Ashton to his first day of kindergarten or dressing him up as Sonic the Hedgehog for Halloween has pushed him to try to persuade Congress to overhaul immigration laws.

“Without a law change,” he said, “she’s not going to come back.”

Jason remains hopeful that Cecilia will return. More than 16 months after she left, her blouses, jeans and hoodies still hang in the bedroom closet.

Her Calvin Klein Contradiction perfume sits on the bathroom vanity. Her wooden crucifix hangs on the bedroom wall.

Now that Ashton is in the clear after months of chemotherapy and radiation, Jason is focused on changing the law so that, as he put it in an online fundraiser, “good people like my wife” can return to the U.S. to be with their “American citizen family.”

Immigrants who have a clear criminal record, he believes, should be ranked in order of priority.

“At the top of the list would be immigrants with an American spouse and American children,” he said. “And then go down to maybe an immigrant with an American spouse but no children and then just the children who are illegal.”

Yes, he conceded, such a system would cost money, but that could be offset by requiring immigrants to pay a fine.

“Isn’t it worth it to be humane?” he said. “To not just separate families?”

Sometimes Jason feels like an outlier in the nation’s polarized immigration debate. After 16 months apart from Cecilia, he has yet to meet another U.S. citizen who is married to an immigrant in the country illegally.

“We’re a very small demographic,” he said. “Usually, illegals are married to illegals.”

But Jason’s story is not uncommon. About 1.2 million immigrants who lack legal status — more than 1 in 10 — are married to a U.S. citizen, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Nearly a third have a child under 18 who is a U.S. citizen.

Still, Jason has struggled to win sympathy across the echo chambers of social media.

When Ashton was going through chemotherapy in October, Jason posted pictures on Twitter of his son in a hospital bed, tagging Trump. “Please read this and help my family!” he wrote. “I voted for you because I believed you would be fare to illegals and now my family is suffering!”

Trump did not respond, but others did, dubbing Jason a “hamburger brain” and a “sociopathic monster.”

“Trump doesn’t believe ‘good illegals’ exist,” one commenter wrote. “I feel bad for your boy. I have zero sympathy for you.”

“Why do Republicans lack all compassion until something happens to them directly?”

Jason tries not to let the partisan digs get him down, preferring to believe that people just don’t understand.

He probably wouldn’t vote for Trump again, he said. Still, he isn’t really sure that he made a mistake.

Sometimes he feels stupid or duped or betrayed. But then he thinks back to how he didn’t vote for himself personally but for the greater good — for what he sees as the “noble” cause of outlawing abortion.","Forced apart by President Trump’s stringent immigration policies, Jason Rochester and Cecilia Gonzalez have spent the last 16 months raising their 6-year-old son from opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.

786,"On a sinking Louisiana island, many aren’t ready to leave",Jenny Jarvie,"The remote land was a refuge for the family throughout the mid-1800s — when Native Americans across the Southeast were forced from their land in a mass relocation that became known as the Trail of Tears. Over the years, Dardars, Chaissons and Billiots joined the Naquins, building simple mud homes with palmetto-thatched roofs on each side of the bayou that formed the main artery of the community.

People mostly kept to themselves, surviving off the land and sea, catching fish, oysters and shrimp, hunting rabbits and deer and raising cows, chickens and pigs.

Modern times did not come to Isle de Jean Charles until 1953, when a two-mile road was built across the marshland to connect the community to Pointe-aux-Chene on the mainland.

Many residents eyed the causeway with suspicion, fearing it would bring outsiders who would try to wrench them from the land.

“If you hear or see a car coming, go hide,” Naquin’s mother warned him.

As it turned out, there was a far greater threat: the vast network of flood-control dams and levees the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was erecting along the Mississippi River.

The system disrupted the flow of sediment into the Mississippi River Delta, a natural process that counteracts the erosion of marshes and wetlands by the encroaching waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Making matters worse, the oil and gas industries were expanding in the delta, and the elaborate web of channels that companies carved through the wetlands for boats and drilling rigs also brought in saltwater that weakened plant roots and hastened erosion. Scientists say climate change will only exacerbate the problem by raising the sea level.

When Isle de Jean Charles became an island is a matter of debate, as the changing marshland around it made the edges difficult to define.

With less marshland buffering the island from waves and storm surge, hurricanes take an ever more devastating toll.

In the last two decades, the number of households has dwindled from about 80 to 20 as a succession of hurricanes — Lili, Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, Isaac — slammed the island, filling homes with thick mud.

A ring of levees built more than a decade ago offers some protection from flooding, but the once-free-flowing bayou is now stagnant and strewn with tires, plastic foam take-out boxes and plastic chairs.

The oyster shacks that once lined its banks have been torn down. The only business is a small marina selling bait, fishing lures and Michelob Ultra.

The remaining islanders are retired or work off the island as grocery store clerks and hospital janitors, commercial fishermen and tugboat captains.

“We don’t mingle like we used to,” said Al Naquin, 68, the chief’s cousin, as he stood on his porch and pointed out the shed that had replaced his grandfather’s grocery store — which also used to serve as a dance hall, church and school.

While a few islanders fish for flounder and trout or grow okra and green beans, others are just as likely to pick up hot dogs and frozen tilapia from a Walmart in Houma, 25 miles away.

Some of the older residents still converse in Cajun French, just like their parents and grandparents, but many of their grandchildren do not understand them.

“It feels like a ghost town,” Erica Billiot, 37, said as her 6-year-old son, Tristan, played on the edge of a broken wooden bridge over the bayou.

Whenever strong southern winds blow, she worries that high tides will flood the only road to the mainland, cutting her off from her job as a baggage handler at a local heliport and preventing the bus from ferrying Tristan to school.

But as she mulls the state plan and the thought of losing her family’s weathered clapboard home, she leans toward staying put a while longer.

“It’s going to go away before I pass,” she said. “It’s only a matter of time.”

It was about 20 years ago when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first approached the chief with the idea of relocating islanders.

But as the barrel-chested Army veteran contemplated the island’s fate, he changed his mind.

Saving the island seemed like a lost cause. In 2002, the Corps decided to exclude the island from a massive 72-mile levee system it was planning, dooming it to a future underwater.

Naquin’s first two attempts to resettle the community failed, as the Corps required a unanimous buy-in, and a small group of residents did not want to leave.

“You can’t get 100% of people to agree on anything,” he said.

Naquin pressed on, working with nonprofits and the state to develop a plan for a community with homes on stilts, a bayou, grocer, tribal museum, green space for powwows and grazing land for buffalo.

“This here can’t be remade some place. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing, a setting away from the world.” Chris Brunet, a lifelong resident of Isle de Jean Charles

In his vision, the community would be not just a safe place for island residents but also a gathering point for the 600 members of his tribe now scattered across coastal Louisiana.

But soon after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development dedicated $48 million to the project in 2016, a rival tribe, United Houma Nation, came forward with a complaint: It had been left out of the plan despite having historic ties to the island.

Interviewing islanders, state officials found that most, but not all, identified — at least loosely — with the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw. A few said they did not trust tribal leaders to execute a resettlement fairly.

That put Louisiana officials in an awkward position: Federal law does not allow housing projects to discriminate based on tribal affiliation or race.

In a decision that remains a major sticking point with Naquin’s tribe, the state went on to invite both tribes to the table as “stakeholders” with the aim of rebuilding the island’s “unique” culture.

“HUD would not have given us money just to go build a subdivision,” said Patrick Forbes, executive director of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “We would consider it a failure if all we did was get people moved out of harm’s way.”

The state plans to create lots for 150 single-family homes on land that had been used for sugarcane fields about 40 miles northwest of the island. The new settlement would also include wetlands, bayous, orchards, a fishing pond, a solar farm and a pasture.

About 30 households — islanders who live full time on the island or were displaced after Hurricane Isaac in 2012 — are eligible for a new home. Some former residents displaced before then would be eligible for a vacant lot, and then any remaining lots would likely be auctioned to the public.

The chief is instructing island residents not to move.

“The state stole our plan to get the money and now they are running off with it,” he said. “It wasn’t for the white folks. We were supposed to have a tribal community.… Now anybody can go.… It’s going to be like a Section 8 subdivision.”

Residents would be allowed to keep their existing homesteads — at least as long as they are above water — with the stipulation that they can’t be sold, rebuilt or used as a primary residence.

The tribe balks at those conditions, complaining the deal gives native islanders fewer rights than the cluster of outsiders who have second homes or fishing shacks on the island. State officials counter that those people are not getting new $170,000 houses.

Residents also worry they will struggle to pay higher property taxes or home insurance in the new community — despite state assurances that those costs will be offset by the energy-saving design of the new homes — on top of their bills if they keep their old properties.

“The plan was to reunite the tribe, and now it’s going to be destroyed,” Naquin said. “Instead of fixing it, I broke it.”

Only one islander showed no hesitation about moving.

“While there’s an opportunity to move to higher ground, wisdom says take advantage of it,” said Father Roch Naquin, a sprightly 86-year-old retired Catholic priest. “If you do not move now and something terrible happens, where are you going to go?”

When he speaks to neighbors, he urges them to have faith that they can bring their spirit to a new place.

“Life changes,” he said. “Just as somehow there was a community built up over here, we have to wake up and build a community wherever we are. That’s the important thing.”

Many residents said that holding on to their native land, or just keeping on with tradition, seemed more important than building a new community.

“I stick to myself,” said Bert Naquin, 61, a health clinic clerk who moved back to the island a year ago after her mother died, affixing a green sign to her front deck saying the home was not for sale. “I’m not afraid to live here by myself.”

No matter how many residents ultimately decide to move, a small band of die-hards vows to resist.

“I stay, me,” said Dardar, the fisherman, as he stood underneath his raised home slicing a fresh trout with a fillet knife. “I ain’t planning to go nowhere, because I don't think the island’s going nowhere.”

Now that the saltwater comes closer to his backyard, he prefers to focus on the positive: He can catch redfish and shrimp where he used to hunt ducks.

“I say it’s changed for the better, me,” he said. “No complaints from me!”

Dardar does not bother himself worrying about whether water will eventually submerge Island Road, cutting his family off from the mainland.","When Isle de Jean Charles became an island is a matter of debate, as the changing marshland around it made the edges difficult to define.

791,"As historically black colleges struggle, Bennett College for women fights to stay afloat",Kurtis Lee,"Pilar Hughes watched students crisscross the wide quad at the center of campus, remembering her first year at Bennett College.

The tiny classes. The soul food lunches served on Wednesdays. The sisterhood and the overwhelming sense of self-worth the all-women’s black college offered.

“There is so much love and community here,” the freshman said on a warm spring morning. “I’m sure the experiences here will help me in life.”

And yet, she plans to transfer.

Bennett, one of two all-women’s historically black colleges in the country, could be on the verge of closure. Years of financial woes have led recently to a federal court battle over its accreditation, without which the future of any college is dim.

Meanwhile, students like Hughes flee. Ten years ago, nearly 800 students roamed Bennett’s campus; now there are fewer than 500.

Bennett’s story reflects that of many of the nation’s 102 historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, most of which formed after the Civil War.

In recent years, the institutions overall have seen enrollments plummet, endowments decrease and student bodies — once entirely black — become more mixed as HBCUs attempt to compete with schools that no longer shut out African Americans.

Desegregation, along with a more recent push for diverse recruits among non-HBCUs and growing incomes among black families, has made historically black colleges and universities a less common option for African Americans.

Fifty years ago, 90% of black postsecondary students attended historically black schools. In 1990, it was close to 17%. Today, around 9% do.

National enrollment reached a peak in 2010 at about 326,000. Today, it’s about 298,000.

The nation’s oldest historically black college, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania — founded in 1837 — has fought to keep its accreditation. It’s trying to raise at least $4 million to stay afloat. Three HBCUs have closed since 2000.

Other schools, including Alabama State University, Paine College in Georgia and Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina, have battled steep enrollment declines and major financial struggles. The same issues have led more than a quarter of the nation’s historically black schools to be put under warning or on probation by accrediting groups in the last decade.

“The situation of HBCUs is precarious,” said Crystal deGregory, a professor who studies their history at Kentucky State University, a historically black college in the state capital, Frankfort. “We don’t know if we’re going to make it.”

We asked for your experiences at historically black colleges. These are your stories »

Not all HBCUs have suffered. The most prestigious have thrived in recent years, with enrollment and endowments growing along with donations from well-known alumni.

“Everybody has heard of Howard, Spelman, Hampton, Morehouse,” said Dianne Suber, former president of tiny St. Augustine’s University in Raleigh, N.C. “But so many others are out there just existing day-to-day, check-to-check or sometimes worse.”

After their establishment, historically black colleges grew in size and influence for more than a century. Many of the oldest are private schools created by churches. Public campuses blossomed in the late 19th century. That’s when a federal law that granted land for universities also required states that barred blacks from institutions of higher education to create separate campuses to serve African Americans.

The schools have educated legions of black artists, business leaders and politicians. Spike Lee attended Morehouse. Oprah Winfrey went to Tennessee State. Jesse Jackson graduated from North Carolina A&T. Thurgood Marshall had degrees from Lincoln and Howard.

Los Angeles Times

Bennett College was founded in 1873 as a co-ed institution in central North Carolina. In the 1920s, it became an all-women’s college, albeit one run by men. That changed in 1955, when Willa Beatrice Player became its president — the first black woman in the nation to lead a four-year accredited liberal arts college.

The campus is a five-minute drive from downtown Greensboro, where in 1960, four students from nearby North Carolina A&T University staged a sit-in at the whites-only Woolworth’s lunch counter. Dozens of women from Bennett joined the sit-ins, which stretched on for months and became among the best-known protests of the civil rights movement.

‘There is a correlation between atmosphere, retention and success at HBCUs.’ Janelle Williams, visiting scholar at the Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions

Black students tend to do better overall at historically black colleges, studies have shown.

“There is a correlation between atmosphere, retention and success at HBCUs” compared with how black students fare at other schools, said Janelle Williams, a visiting scholar at the Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions at the University of Pennsylvania.

A study released last year by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Massachusetts at Boston also found that black students at HBCUs were more likely to graduate within six years than black students at predominantly white institutions. Black students at HBCUs are more likely to go on to graduate school than those who attend other schools, Williams said.

One advantage that historically black college students have is that their schools tend to be small; more than half have 2,500 or fewer students. But the size has also made financial and enrollment dips harder to manage.

In the last decade, HBCUs have increasingly recruited students who are not black, offering scholarships and touting their small class sizes and role in the fight for racial equality. At a quarter of the schools, non-black students make up at least 20% of enrollment today.

At Bennett, which graduated its first white student in 1960 — a civil rights activist who was part of the lunch-counter sit-in — white students make up a tiny minority.

‘I wanted the experience — at least for my education — to be one that is exclusively black.’ Pilar Hughes, Bennett College student

Hughes, 19, grew up in New Jersey and had never lived outside the Northeast. After attending a mostly white high school, she wanted an all-black education.

“When else in life will you be able to be in an all-black setting working toward a common goal — getting a degree? That was a question I thought about a lot before deciding on Bennett,” she said, noting that a predominantly white institution — which is commonly referred to on campus by the acronym PWI — was never an option.

“The country is run by white people,” Hughes said. “I wanted the experience — at least for my education — to be one that is exclusively black.”

Hughes arrived in August. Four months later, as the struggles of the college became clear, she made a painful decision: She needed to transfer.

“Having a degree from an unaccredited — or potentially unaccredited — university makes no sense,” Hughes said.

On a recent morning, the biology major dropped by the enrollment management center to get her transcripts. She plans to apply to North Carolina A&T.

“I love this campus and these people. But the issues this school faces could hurt my future.… I have to move on.”

‘It would be upsetting to see my potential alma mater no longer in existence.’ Abigail Mosley, Bennett College student

Abigail Mosley grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland and knew from an early age that she wanted to enroll at a historically black college or university. She’d felt stunted at her predominantly white high school, especially when learning about black history.

“Everything is narrated through a white lens,” the 21-year-old said.

She earned an associate’s degree near home, and last spring started looking at four-year colleges. Mosley was admitted to Spelman — the only other women's HBCU — but the Atlanta college didn’t offer her enough scholarship money.

While visiting colleges in North Carolina, she spent an afternoon at Bennett with her parents. They walked between the two- and three-story red brick buildings with bright white trim, where every class and dorm is within a 10-minute stroll. Knotty magnolias created patches of shade, and the calm of the small campus put her at ease.

“Immediately, I knew I wanted to attend,” Mosley said. “I can text my professors … there is investment in students from faculty.”

But Mosley recently applied and was accepted to Cleveland State University, a non-HBCU that’s closer to home.

“I have to have a backup plan,” she said. Once she gets her degree in political science, she wants to start a nonprofit in Cleveland that focuses on community organizing.

“It’s all up in the air right now,” Mosley said. “It would be upsetting to see my potential alma mater no longer in existence.”

In recent months, after going public with its accreditation struggle, Bennett netted more than $9.5 million in donations. Its accreditor, the Southern Assn. of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, nonetheless said Bennett was in financial trouble and took away its status. Accreditation allows colleges to offer Pell Grants, federally guaranteed loans and work-study programs, and make a degree more valuable.

The school had borrowed tens of millions from the federal government since 2001 for new construction, upkeep and refinancing, and it was in the red by more than $1 million in 2017. Last year, it was one of eight historically black colleges that were given six-year interest-free deferments on federal loans.

But school administrators, pointing to a budget surplus of $461,000 last year and the fundraising success, say the campus is on the mend. Bennett sued over its accreditation status, and in February, it won a temporary reprieve while the case proceeds.

There are bits of good news in Greensboro and for historically black schools, though. Nationwide enrollment, after hitting a 15-year low in 2016, increased by 2% in 2017. The jump came as overall enrollment in the U.S. fell. At Bennett College, enrollment grew more than 15% this year, to 471.

Some see the bump as reflecting young people applying to colleges in an era of increasing hate crimes and resurgent white supremacy. “Parents are rethinking what kind of environments students should be in for their education,” Suber said.

Bennett and other HBCUs were briefly in the spotlight after President Trump invited dozens of the schools’ presidents to the Oval Office the month after his inauguration. He vowed to make the institutions an “absolute priority” and later signed an executive order promising increased support.

Last year, the federal government forgave $322 million in loans to four historically black colleges in Louisiana and Mississippi that had borrowed money after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In 2017, Congress approved the return of year-round Pell Grants, which can be used for summer classes; more than 70% of HBCU students receive the grants.

But some students and leaders now view the Oval Office visit as little more than a photo op.

The Rev. Natalie McLean has worked as Bennett College's chaplain for 17 years. Veasey Conway / For The Times

As Bennett College’s future remains uncertain, some students have gone to the campus chapel to seek reassurance. They sit among white pews as light from narrow windows falls on a glass panel of a black Madonna.

“Students are concerned and are looking for answers,” the Rev. Natalie McLean said on a recent afternoon at the chapel.

McLean, 60, has spent 17 years as the school’s chaplain. She graduated from Bennett in 1980; her mother earned a degree from the school in 1954.

To McLean, the struggle of historically black colleges isn’t just about the future, but about remembering the past at schools that “provide unvarnished looks into history.” Beating the odds is what HBCUs are about, she said. McLean prays and is confident her school will survive the battle.

“We’re fragile,” she said, “yet fertile.”

Among them was an infrastructure council that disbanded within a month; members resigned in 2017 after Trump’s qualified criticism of white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Va.

At least 12 included language such as “encourage” or “to the extent permitted by law,” underscoring the president’s lack of authority to make sweeping change without help from Congress.

At least 15 reversed or curtailed Obama’s initiatives, notably the orders overturning environmental regulations. Those made for some of Trump’s most consequential actions even as they demonstrated a major drawback of executive orders — they can fairly easily be undone by a successor. Also, courts have blocked some environmental rollbacks.

At least 43 called for agency reports or reviews, including one on historically black colleges and another on retirement savings rules.

812,A mother risked her life to reunite with her kids in the U.S. Now she faces prison time,Kate Linthicum,"In the weeks after her deportation, Mayra Machado sat alone in a dark room, staring at her phone.

In video chats, her three children battered her with questions. Where was she? Why had she abandoned them? When would she come home to Arkansas?

She couldn’t bear to tell them the truth — that she was in a remote village in El Salvador overrun with gangs — so she lied. “I’m fine,” she said. “I’ll be home soon.”

The United States deports hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year. But for Machado and other parents of American-born children, staying in their home country sometimes simply isn’t an option, despite the risk.

To keep her promise to her kids, Machado had to embark on a dangerous journey abetted by abusive smugglers linked to a powerful drug cartel.

She would eventually make her way back to the sleepy town of Siloam Springs, Ark., but a reckless decision from her youth — and a little-known feature of American immigration policy — would threaten to separate her family yet again.

Machado was 5 when she and her mother crossed illegally to the United States, fleeing bombings in their village during the final years of El Salvador’s civil war.

She grew up speaking English with a laid-back California accent during her youth in Santa Ana. Later, after she and her mother moved to be near family in Arkansas, she adopted a gentle Southern drawl. She loved shopping and football and moved through life with a cheerful American optimism.

At age 19, Machado made a foolish mistake. After she fell behind on loan payments, her car was impounded. To get it out, she forged a friend's signature on two checks totaling $1,500.

She was found guilty of three felonies and, after completing a court-ordered boot camp program, vowed to never mess up like that again.

A decade later, Machado said, she had turned her life around. She worked at an ophthalmologist’s office, drove a BMW and had three photogenic kids. The father of her children was out of the picture, but Machado had met a kind man with a good job and they were engaged.

Shortly before Christmas in 2015, a routine traffic stop changed everything. Because she had an unpaid ticket, Machado was taken to a police station. There, an officer deputized to act as an immigration agent discovered Machado’s felony convictions and began the process that led to her deportation.

Unlike previous administrations, which had often targeted immigrants for deportation using arbitrary traffic checkpoints or workplace raids, President Obama had vowed to prioritize removals only of people with criminal convictions, saying he would target “felons not families.” Machado thought she had paid her debt to society but discovered that as an immigrant in the country illegally, she didn’t have the luxury of making mistakes.

After fighting her case for 13 months, Machado was deported in January 2017. She arrived in El Salvador in shackles on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement plane.

Distant relatives had offered her a place to stay in the rural hamlet of Hacienda La Carrera, but her broken Spanish and American clothing made her a target. Many homes had been abandoned by residents fleeing gangs that levied “taxes” on locals and forced pretty women to be their girlfriends. In an interview in the village last year, Machado said machete-toting gang members had begun loitering outside.

Still, what kept her up at night, as she listened for occasional bursts of gunfire and swatted away the mosquitoes that bit her arms and legs raw, was fear for her children: Dominic, 12; Dyanara, 11; and Dorian, 8. They were living in Siloam Springs with their grandmother, who rose before dawn to work at a meat-packing plant.

Dominic still didn’t know where she was but blamed himself for his mother’s disappearance. At the time of the 2016 traffic stop, Machado had been returning to the store where he had left his eyeglasses.

The bright, outgoing boy, who shared his mother’s wide smile and almond-shaped eyes, had become withdrawn during the months Machado spent in immigrant detention. He had started lashing out at his younger sister. His grades were slipping.

Machado knew the dangers of trying to return to the United States. But, she told herself, she was a mother, and mothers are supposed to be with their kids.

So one morning in March 2017, less than three months after she was deported, Machado woke at dawn and trudged through miles of sugar cane fields toward a narrow highway, where she caught the first of many buses north.

She was finally nearing the U.S. border when a smuggler put a gun to her head.

Machado had been on the migrant trail for weeks, hiding from authorities in taxi trunks and crowded tractor-trailers. She had gone days at a time without eating and had begun dreaming about what it would feel like to take a shower.

But only now, as the smuggler cocked his gun, did she realize the danger she was in.

“I’m in the hands of the Gulf cartel ,” she thought. And then: “I might die, and my children will never see their mother again.”

Machado had used $8,000 of her savings to pay a smuggling network that had promised a short journey to the United States. But arriving that April in Tamaulipas, the northern Mexican state where drug gangs had entered the human trafficking business, it didn’t matter that Machado had paid all that cash weeks before. The smugglers said she would have to wait to cross the border until they were ready.

At a dingy safe house filled with dirty mattresses, Machado was made to cook and clean. She knew nothing about Mexican cuisine, and when she messed up while making salsa, the men threw it in her face.

“You’re fat and lazy!” screamed one cartel member as he beat her. Twice, Machado said, she fought off his attempts at rape.

After months in captivity, the smugglers helped Machado cross the border. It was the Fourth of July, 2017.

Two family members picked her up in Texas and drove all night to Arkansas. Shortly before sunrise, she opened the door to the bedroom where her children were sleeping and woke them up with hugs.

“I’m dreaming,” they murmured.

“No,” she said. “I’m really here.”

Back in Arkansas, Machado knew she had to earn back the trust of her children. Dominic had made that clear.

“Why did you have to go away?” he would ask on the days that he spoke to her at all.

For so long, she had lied. Finally, she decided to tell him the truth.

“I wasn’t born here, and I don’t have citizenship,” she said. Then she told him about the forged checks: “It was the worst mistake of my life.”

Machado opened a map, pointed to El Salvador and showed Dominic the more than 2,000 miles she had traveled. Dominic asked if she was going to disappear again. She shook her head.

In March of this year, she and the kids moved in with her fiance, Tony, whom her youngest son had started calling Dad. But she still lived a life in the shadows. Machado didn’t have an ID. Didn’t have a job. On the rare occasions she drove, she scanned the rearview mirror for police.

On a hot afternoon in May, she took the risk of picking up her daughter, who had just completed fifth grade. At a roundabout, the car in front of her stopped suddenly. Machado didn’t.

The woman’s Mercedes was not badly damaged, and Machado offered to pay on the spot for repairs. But the driver was angry and called the police.

Machado panicked. She phoned her best friend, who urged her to flee. That would be wrong, Machado said.

“OK,” her friend urged. “When the police come, give them my name instead of yours.”

That’s what Machado did, but the officer grew suspicious. Why didn’t Machado’s photo flash on his screen when he typed her name into his system?

When he threatened to call a fingerprint expert, Machado started crying. “My name is Mayra,” she said.

The officer charged her with a felony for obstruction of government operations. The charge was eventually dropped, but by then Machado had been flagged by ICE, and she was once again taken into immigration custody.

Only this time, she would be charged with a more serious crime.

The Washington County Detention Center in Fayetteville, Ark., is a cluster of low-slung buildings in a suburban office park. Machado has been living there for months alongside women charged with federal crimes that include drug trafficking and murder.

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. government stepped up the criminal prosecution of immigrants, reversing its longtime practice of treating immigration offenses as civil matters. Machado is one of thousands of immigrants who have been charged this year with the felony crime of reentering the U.S. after a previous deportation.

Her court-appointed attorney has asked Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican whose reelection campaign has been endorsed by President Trump, to pardon Machado for the check forgery, in hopes of eliminating the rationale for deporting her. A grass-roots campaign has also taken up Machado’s cause, recently holding a rally outside the Arkansas prison where activists chanted “Free Mama Mayra!”

If those efforts fail, Machado faces up to two years in prison — followed by a second deportation.

The idea of remaining behind pains her, but it is less scary than the idea of being immediately deported again. “At least I’ll be safe in prison,” she said.

Machado has been prescribed medication for anxiety and depression, but in phone interviews from prison, she said she still cries all day. Her only respite, she said, is a twice-weekly Bible study class — and books.

She’s trying to be a mother from afar, speaking on the phone at a cost of 50 cents a minute.

“Who will do my hair when you’re not here?” her little girl asks. “I want to cuddle with you,” her youngest son says.

Dominic doesn’t speak much. He spends much of his time on his PlayStation. But recently, on a phone call, he told his mother, “If you go away again, it will break my heart.”

If she is eventually deported, she would not bring the kids to El Salvador, not with the gangs.

“What if they looked at my daughter the way they looked at me?” she wonders. “Would my son become one of them?”

Machado wonders, too, if she will be able to stay in El Salvador, or if she will try to reach the U.S. once again.

1045,About CBC News,Cbc News,"WHO WE ARE

Founded in 1941, CBC News is Canada's publicly owned news and information service. We are rooted in every region of the country and report on Canada and the world to provide a Canadian perspective on news and current affairs.

Our mission is to inform, to reveal, to contribute to the understanding of issues of public interest and to encourage citizens to participate in our free and democratic society.

We have journalists stationed in over 40 cities across Canada. We also have bureaus in London, Jerusalem, Beijing, Washington, New York City, Los Angeles and Moscow.

CBC News uses pop-up bureaus as well, with reporters who fly in when a story occurs beyond our existing bureaus.

STAFF AND DIVERSITY

CBC News is committed to accurately reflecting the range of experiences and points of view of all citizens. All Canadians, of whatever origins, perspectives and beliefs, should feel that our news and current affairs coverage is relevant to them and lives up to our principles.

We have a special responsibility to reflect regional and cultural diversity, as well as fostering respect and understanding across regions.

JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS

LABELLING CONTENT

CBC News uses labels as signals to help readers identify the status of different kinds of stories. Labels are used to flag stories that are breaking news or contain live elements such as video.

CBC News also uses labels to distinguish clearly between analysis and opinion.

Analysis — Here, reporters may make observations and draw conclusions based on facts as well as their own experience and expertise.

Opinion — On an exceptional basis, we may choose to appoint certain journalists as columnists. They have licence to express their opinions. To protect the integrity of CBC's journalism, we will restrict the role of such columnists to opinion and commentary. Their work will be clearly identified as opinion.

When presenting content where a single opinion or point of view is featured, we ensure that a diversity of perspective is provided across a network or platform and in an appropriate time frame.

BYLINES

CBC News stories based on original reporting carry reporter bylines, which include information about the author such as expertise, location, biographical and contact information. Bylines link to author pages that include other articles by the writer.

1046,,Senior Writer,"House prices may be as high as ever in many parts of the country, but Canadian homebuyers are being offered some of the lowest mortgage rates seen in years as lenders battle to drum up new business.

Rates on a standard five-year fixed-rate mortgage have fallen to their lowest level in two years, according to rate comparison website, Ratehub.ca.

Borrowers just about everywhere across the country can take their pick of offerings well below three per cent at the moment, says James Laird, the site's co-founder and president of mortgage brokerage, CanWise Financial.

That's partly for seasonal reasons, he says, in that the spring months are typically the best ones for home buying, as families try to get moved and settled before summer vacations and then the new school year sets in.

""Promotions are April, May and June … when all mortgage companies try to make sure they are on track to hit their annual targets,"" Laird said in an interview. ""Anyone who's behind at this point would be aggressive with the margins they're willing to fund mortgages at right now.""

At the moment, Laird says he's seeing five-year fixed rates as low as 2.64 per cent for certain buyers, and even higher-risk borrowers can easily find a loan for 2.89 per cent. That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.

Unlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate and make money on that spread.

So current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.

""The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,"" Laird said. ""And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.""

Less popular loans

Variable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.

Most borrowers prefer the peace of mind of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates — even if they're only temporary.

Laird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.

He says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.

Anyone signing up for that loan today is ""assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,"" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.

Trading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank this year — but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.

Lower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.

1 in 6 mortgages up for renewal

A recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)

But thanks to the steep slide in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.

""With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,"" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau said.

Laird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.

Housing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.

But until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly: ""Pretty cheap money.""",,"['bank', 'cent', 'loan', 'lenders', 'rate', 'money', 'mortgage', 'loans', 'point', 'rates']",,https://www.cbc.ca

At the moment, Laird says he's seeing five-year fixed rates as low as 2.64 per cent for certain buyers, and even higher-risk borrowers can easily find a loan for 2.89 per cent. That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.

Unlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate and make money on that spread.

So current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.

""The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,"" Laird said. ""And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.""

Less popular loans

Variable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.

Most borrowers prefer the peace of mind of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates — even if they're only temporary.

Laird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.

He says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.

Anyone signing up for that loan today is ""assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,"" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.

Trading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank this year — but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.

Lower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.

1 in 6 mortgages up for renewal

A recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)

But thanks to the steep slide in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.

""With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,"" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau said.

Laird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.

Housing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.

1056,,Politics,"A year ago, Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives secured a decisive victory in Ontario's provincial election. In the process, they laid out a roadmap for Andrew Scheer's Conservatives to follow in this year's federal election: win the same parts of Ontario that Ford did and watch Prime Minister Justin Trudeau go the way of former premier Kathleen Wynne.

But ""Ford Nation"" is not the towering electoral coalition it's sometimes made out to be. Even if Scheer wins every Ontario vote in October that Ford won last year, that alone wouldn't be enough to defeat the Trudeau Liberals.

He'd need a little help. Luckily for him, the Liberals are providing it — for now.

In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals won 80 seats in Ontario. In the 2018 provincial election, the Ontario PCs won 76 seats.

With the exception of ridings in northern Ontario, the electoral map in the province is identical at both levels of government.

In southern Ontario, 42 ridings elected both Liberal MPs in 2015 and PC MPPs in 2018. They're predominantly located in the Greater Toronto Area, with 11 in Toronto itself and another 21 in the surrounding 905 area code. Three ridings in the northern part of the province with largely similar electoral boundaries also split between Trudeau in one election and Ford in the next.

If Scheer is able to flip these 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings in October's election, that alone would be enough to deprive the prime minister of another majority government and (at the least) put Scheer in the driver's seat in a minority Parliament.

But despite Ford's commanding victory last year — the most seats won by any Ontario party since Mike Harris in 1995 — his vote tally was remarkably similar to the score Stephen Harper put up in his losing 2015 campaign.

The Harper Conservatives received the support of 2,293,393 Ontarians in 2015. Three years later, the Ontario PCs earned 2,326,523 votes, or about 1.4 per cent more than the federal Conservatives did — far less than the rate of growth in the province's population over that time.

Conservative Leader Stephen Harper speaks with supporters at a 2015 election campaign event in Kitchener, Ont. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

In the Trudeau-Ford ridings, the Ontario PCs captured about 29,000 more votes than the Harper Conservatives did in 2015 — averaging just 638 more votes per riding than Harper won. There is a clear relationship between the performance of the PCs in each of these ridings and the performance of the federal Conservatives three years earlier, suggesting that this is largely the same pool of voters.

That pool was only big enough to win the Conservatives 33 seats in 2015. In only four of these Trudeau-Ford ridings did the Ontario PCs win more votes in the provincial election than the Trudeau Liberals did in the federal election.

In other words, if the Liberal vote holds and Scheer manages to get every Ontario PC supporter to cast a ballot for his party in October, he gains only four of these Trudeau-Ford seats (and polls suggest the ranks of Ontario PC supporters are thinner today than they once were).

The winning Ford vote in 2018 is very much like the losing Harper vote in 2015. If Scheer can't improve upon those results, he needs the Liberals to fall back.

Liberal drop, not 'Ford Nation', key to Scheer win in Ontario

Turnout in the federal election in 2015 was far higher in Ontario (67.8 per cent) than it was in the provincial election in 2018 (56.7 per cent). The Trudeau Liberals also received many more votes than the Ontario Liberals did.

That's why the roadmap provided by the Ontario PCs is not one that can win an election for Scheer on its own. The federal Liberals would need to lose about 280,000 votes across the Trudeau-Ford ridings for Liberal candidates to receive fewer votes than the winning PC candidates did in 2018. That represents about a quarter of the votes Trudeau's party got in those ridings four years ago.

The good news for Scheer is that — according to the CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data — that's what has happened to the Liberals in Ontario. With 34.3 per cent support in the province, the Liberals have lost about 11 points from their performance in the 2015 federal election, or just under one in every four votes they received.

But at 35.2 per cent, the Conservatives are no further ahead today in Ontario than they were in 2015. With these levels of support, any win in a Trudeau-Ford riding by Scheer would be due to the drop in the Liberal vote, rather than any increase in the Conservative vote.

Scheer needs Liberals to go elsewhere or stay home

Two factors contributed to Ford's victory in 2018. One was the bleeding of Liberal support to Andrea Horwath's New Democrats. The other was a lot of Liberals staying home on election day.

Though we can't know for certain how (or if) Ontarians who supported Trudeau in 2015 voted in the 2018 election, the numbers are stark. In the 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings alone, the Ontario Liberals received nearly 700,000 fewer votes than the federal Liberals did.

The Ontario New Democrats under leader Andrea Horwath were the primary beneficiaries of a drop in Liberal support in 2018. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)

The Ontario New Democrats were the biggest beneficiaries, as they received about 300,000 more votes than their federal cousins did in the province. The Ontario Greens and PCs, however, did just about as well as the federal parties who fly the same colours.

This means that perhaps as many as half of the voters who supported the Trudeau Liberals in 2015 in these key swing ridings stayed home in 2018 rather than cast a ballot for the Wynne Liberals.

Still, the parts of the province that supported Ford in last year's election are the same areas that helped give Harper his majority government in 2011. The Conservatives will be looking to the same bits of Ontario to help them win in October.

But Scheer will need to follow a narrow path if he wants to win the same way that Ford did — a path that banks on a big chunk of the Liberal vote staying home, or showing up only to support other parties. The polls suggest the Liberals are vulnerable — but also that they might be at their lowest ebb. Scheer can't count on things staying this way as the election date approaches.

His chances would improve if he instead grows the Conservative tent in Ontario, since without a split on the centre-left or a disengaged electorate, there just aren't enough Ford backers in the province to win Scheer a federal election.",,"['liberals', 'votes', 'ford', 'scheer', 'federal', 'ontario', '2015', 'win', 'ridings', 'election']",,https://www.cbc.ca

But despite Ford's commanding victory last year — the most seats won by any Ontario party since Mike Harris in 1995 — his vote tally was remarkably similar to the score Stephen Harper put up in his losing 2015 campaign.

The Harper Conservatives received the support of 2,293,393 Ontarians in 2015. Three years later, the Ontario PCs earned 2,326,523 votes, or about 1.4 per cent more than the federal Conservatives did — far less than the rate of growth in the province's population over that time.

In the Trudeau-Ford ridings, the Ontario PCs captured about 29,000 more votes than the Harper Conservatives did in 2015 — averaging just 638 more votes per riding than Harper won. There is a clear relationship between the performance of the PCs in each of these ridings and the performance of the federal Conservatives three years earlier, suggesting that this is largely the same pool of voters.

That pool was only big enough to win the Conservatives 33 seats in 2015. In only four of these Trudeau-Ford ridings did the Ontario PCs win more votes in the provincial election than the Trudeau Liberals did in the federal election.

In other words, if the Liberal vote holds and Scheer manages to get every Ontario PC supporter to cast a ballot for his party in October, he gains only four of these Trudeau-Ford seats (and polls suggest the ranks of Ontario PC supporters are thinner today than they once were).

The winning Ford vote in 2018 is very much like the losing Harper vote in 2015. If Scheer can't improve upon those results, he needs the Liberals to fall back.

Liberal drop, not 'Ford Nation', key to Scheer win in Ontario

Turnout in the federal election in 2015 was far higher in Ontario (67.8 per cent) than it was in the provincial election in 2018 (56.7 per cent). The Trudeau Liberals also received many more votes than the Ontario Liberals did.

That's why the roadmap provided by the Ontario PCs is not one that can win an election for Scheer on its own. The federal Liberals would need to lose about 280,000 votes across the Trudeau-Ford ridings for Liberal candidates to receive fewer votes than the winning PC candidates did in 2018. That represents about a quarter of the votes Trudeau's party got in those ridings four years ago.

The good news for Scheer is that — according to the CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data — that's what has happened to the Liberals in Ontario. With 34.3 per cent support in the province, the Liberals have lost about 11 points from their performance in the 2015 federal election, or just under one in every four votes they received.

But at 35.2 per cent, the Conservatives are no further ahead today in Ontario than they were in 2015. With these levels of support, any win in a Trudeau-Ford riding by Scheer would be due to the drop in the Liberal vote, rather than any increase in the Conservative vote.

Scheer needs Liberals to go elsewhere or stay home

Two factors contributed to Ford's victory in 2018. One was the bleeding of Liberal support to Andrea Horwath's New Democrats. The other was a lot of Liberals staying home on election day.

Though we can't know for certain how (or if) Ontarians who supported Trudeau in 2015 voted in the 2018 election, the numbers are stark. In the 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings alone, the Ontario Liberals received nearly 700,000 fewer votes than the federal Liberals did.

The Ontario New Democrats under leader Andrea Horwath were the primary beneficiaries of a drop in Liberal support in 2018. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)

The Ontario New Democrats were the biggest beneficiaries, as they received about 300,000 more votes than their federal cousins did in the province. The Ontario Greens and PCs, however, did just about as well as the federal parties who fly the same colours.

This means that perhaps as many as half of the voters who supported the Trudeau Liberals in 2015 in these key swing ridings stayed home in 2018 rather than cast a ballot for the Wynne Liberals.

Still, the parts of the province that supported Ford in last year's election are the same areas that helped give Harper his majority government in 2011. The Conservatives will be looking to the same bits of Ontario to help them win in October.

But Scheer will need to follow a narrow path if he wants to win the same way that Ford did — a path that banks on a big chunk of the Liberal vote staying home, or showing up only to support other parties. The polls suggest the Liberals are vulnerable — but also that they might be at their lowest ebb. Scheer can't count on things staying this way as the election date approaches.

His chances would improve if he instead grows the Conservative tent in Ontario, since without a split on the centre-left or a disengaged electorate, there just aren't enough Ford backers in the province to win Scheer a federal election.",,"['liberals', 'votes', 'ford', 'scheer', 'federal', 'ontario', '2015', 'win', 'ridings', 'election']",,https://www.cbc.ca

They're predominantly located in the Greater Toronto Area, with 11 in Toronto itself and another 21 in the surrounding 905 area code. Three ridings in the northern part of the province with largely similar electoral boundaries also split between Trudeau in one election and Ford in the next.

If Scheer is able to flip these 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings in October's election, that alone would be enough to deprive the prime minister of another majority government and (at the least) put Scheer in the driver's seat in a minority Parliament.

But despite Ford's commanding victory last year — the most seats won by any Ontario party since Mike Harris in 1995 — his vote tally was remarkably similar to the score Stephen Harper put up in his losing 2015 campaign.

The Harper Conservatives received the support of 2,293,393 Ontarians in 2015. Three years later, the Ontario PCs earned 2,326,523 votes, or about 1.4 per cent more than the federal Conservatives did — far less than the rate of growth in the province's population over that time.

In the Trudeau-Ford ridings, the Ontario PCs captured about 29,000 more votes than the Harper Conservatives did in 2015 — averaging just 638 more votes per riding than Harper won. There is a clear relationship between the performance of the PCs in each of these ridings and the performance of the federal Conservatives three years earlier, suggesting that this is largely the same pool of voters.

That pool was only big enough to win the Conservatives 33 seats in 2015. In only four of these Trudeau-Ford ridings did the Ontario PCs win more votes in the provincial election than the Trudeau Liberals did in the federal election.

In other words, if the Liberal vote holds and Scheer manages to get every Ontario PC supporter to cast a ballot for his party in October, he gains only four of these Trudeau-Ford seats (and polls suggest the ranks of Ontario PC supporters are thinner today than they once were).

The winning Ford vote in 2018 is very much like the losing Harper vote in 2015. If Scheer can't improve upon those results, he needs the Liberals to fall back.

Liberal drop, not 'Ford Nation', key to Scheer win in Ontario

Turnout in the federal election in 2015 was far higher in Ontario (67.8 per cent) than it was in the provincial election in 2018 (56.7 per cent). The Trudeau Liberals also received many more votes than the Ontario Liberals did.

That's why the roadmap provided by the Ontario PCs is not one that can win an election for Scheer on its own. The federal Liberals would need to lose about 280,000 votes across the Trudeau-Ford ridings for Liberal candidates to receive fewer votes than the winning PC candidates did in 2018. That represents about a quarter of the votes Trudeau's party got in those ridings four years ago.

The good news for Scheer is that — according to the CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data — that's what has happened to the Liberals in Ontario. With 34.3 per cent support in the province, the Liberals have lost about 11 points from their performance in the 2015 federal election, or just under one in every four votes they received.

But at 35.2 per cent, the Conservatives are no further ahead today in Ontario than they were in 2015. With these levels of support, any win in a Trudeau-Ford riding by Scheer would be due to the drop in the Liberal vote, rather than any increase in the Conservative vote.

Scheer needs Liberals to go elsewhere or stay home

Two factors contributed to Ford's victory in 2018. One was the bleeding of Liberal support to Andrea Horwath's New Democrats. The other was a lot of Liberals staying home on election day.

Though we can't know for certain how (or if) Ontarians who supported Trudeau in 2015 voted in the 2018 election, the numbers are stark. In the 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings alone, the Ontario Liberals received nearly 700,000 fewer votes than the federal Liberals did.

The Ontario New Democrats under leader Andrea Horwath were the primary beneficiaries of a drop in Liberal support in 2018. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)

The Ontario New Democrats were the biggest beneficiaries, as they received about 300,000 more votes than their federal cousins did in the province. The Ontario Greens and PCs, however, did just about as well as the federal parties who fly the same colours.

This means that perhaps as many as half of the voters who supported the Trudeau Liberals in 2015 in these key swing ridings stayed home in 2018 rather than cast a ballot for the Wynne Liberals.

Still, the parts of the province that supported Ford in last year's election are the same areas that helped give Harper his majority government in 2011. The Conservatives will be looking to the same bits of Ontario to help them win in October.

But Scheer will need to follow a narrow path if he wants to win the same way that Ford did — a path that banks on a big chunk of the Liberal vote staying home, or showing up only to support other parties. The polls suggest the Liberals are vulnerable — but also that they might be at their lowest ebb. Scheer can't count on things staying this way as the election date approaches.

Canadian cities are discovering a new energy source: food waste

(Peter Bromley/City of Hamilton)

It can be hard to imagine household food waste producing anything more than a putrid odour. But it's also a potential energy source.

In Canadian municipalities with green bin programs, household organics are collected at the curb and sent to a central facility where they are broken down by microorganisms. One result of this process is something called raw biogas.

A growing number of these cities are upgrading that biogas (from a methane concentration of 55 to 60 per cent to 90 per cent or more) to produce what is called renewable natural gas (RNG). RNG is similar in quality to conventional natural gas and can be injected into a natural gas pipeline to heat buildings and fuel vehicles.

The City of Toronto, for example, is getting into the RNG business by expanding and upgrading one of its organics processing facilities. Once the equipment is installed this year, the biogas will be ""purified"" to RNG and injected into Enbridge's natural gas grid.

""It seems like such a no-brainer, in my mind,"" said Carlyle Khan, a director in Toronto's solid waste management department. ""I don't understand why other municipalities aren't doing it.""

According to a 2013 study by the Canadian Biogas Association, capturing biogas from all potential sources (agriculture, landfill, wastewater and municipal organics) could produce 2.42 billion cubic metres of RNG annually and reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 37.5 million tonnes — the equivalent of removing 7.5 million cars from the road.

Biogas harvested from residential organic waste alone could produce 140 million cubic metres of RNG and reduce GHGs by 2.2 million tonnes.

RNG is still very much an emerging field. According to Jennifer Green, executive director of the Canadian Biogas Association, there are only about 12 RNG facilities in operation or due to come online in Canada.

Green said the City of Hamilton was the first Ontario municipality to use its wastewater treatment facility to generate RNG. In 2006, it installed a 1.6-megawatt cogeneration unit at the Woodward plant to produce electricity and heat facility buildings.

Meanwhile, Surrey, B.C., has been processing the 65,000 tonnes of organic material it collects annually from residences and apartment buildings at a new facility that opened last spring. Harry Janda, Surrey's solid waste manager, said the city is using RNG to fuel its garbage trucks and is on target to reduce its carbon footprint by about 22,000 tonnes a year.

And then there's Stratford, Ont. It's embarking on a $15.5-million RNG project in partnership with its wastewater treatment plant operator that is set to open in 2020-21. Ed Dujlovic, Stratford's director of infrastructure and development services, said his city is in the final stages of inking a 20-year deal to sell RNG in Ontario to FortisBC Energy on the West Coast.

Dujlovic said as soon as the deal is done, it ""gives the roadmap for everyone else.""

Old issues of What on Earth? are here .

The Big Picture: Water consumption

Water is one of our most important resources, but not everyone has equal access to it. According to the advocacy group Water.org, more than 800 million people worldwide can't get safe drinking water and 2.3 billion don't have access to a toilet . But for many of the dwellers of this planet, particularly in the West, this is an invisible issue. Here's a look at the biggest users, per capita, of water in the world , according to 2016 figures.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

The growing move to decarbonize the world economy is of increasing concern to oil and gas companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil. Know what else has them worried? The global push to drastically reduce plastic — much of which, of course, is made from petroleum.

Speaking of which … in a bid to dissuade visitors from buying water in disposable plastic bottles, Iceland's government has launched a tourism campaign touting the deliciousness of its tap water . The fact that it's ""pure glacial water filtered through lava for thousands of years"" certainly helps.

Since we started this newsletter last October, many of you have written in to express your ambivalence about air travel, given its rather large (and growing) carbon footprint. This essay in the New York Times captures that tension of wanting to see the world while knowing the environmental cost of doing so .

Fast fashion: Not a good look for the planet

(Jude Domski/Getty Images)

For everyday fashion shoppers, it is pivotal to stay on top of trends – for the right price, of course. But for the planet, it's a major sustainability issue.

In the last few decades, there has been a growing move toward ""fast fashion,"" defined as inexpensive, trendy clothes that copy the latest catwalk designs and bring them to consumers through major retailers like H&M, Zara and Topshop.

According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps businesses become more sustainable, the fast fashion industry is worth 1.3 trillion US . But there are serious questions about how the clothes are made, how much we buy and how we dispose of it.

""Shopping will make you feel better — momentarily,"" said Anabel Maldonado, a fashion psychologist based in London, England. But there are risks to over-consumption.

A study in the journal Nature Climate Change said fast fashion has caused a spike in clothing consumption and waste over the last two decades. The consultancy McKinsey reports that consumers, on average, are buying 60 per cent more clothing textiles compared to 2000 , but keeping clothes for only half as long.

Textile production primarily uses non-renewable resources, including oil, to create synthetic fibres, fertilizers to grow cotton and chemical colour dyes. It's not uncommon for fast fashion textiles to be made from blends of different fabrics, which makes recycling garments much more difficult. Not only that, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation reports that in 2015, the fashion industry produced 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases .

Maldonado said that because fast fashion is so cheap, it can lead to compulsive buying. And that doesn't bode well for the planet.

Fashion historian and designer James Fowler said consumers, on the whole, are not aware of the hidden costs. ""The new generation has been given fast fashion, and they don't realize the end result is problematic,"" said Fowler. ""We are hooked on the idea that we can go out and buy a T-shirt for eight dollars.""

Major players in the fashion industry have begun making conscious efforts to be more green – Nike and Central Saint Martins, for example, created a sustainability manual for designers . It suggests using low-impact materials ( limiting the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals ), designing with recyclability in mind and minimizing manufacturing waste.

H&M and Zara have also launched sustainability initiatives. H&M named its sustainability line the Conscious Collection . Zara's parent company, Inditex, has an eco-label called Join Life .

Consumers obviously play a big role in the demand for fast fashion. Maldonado said the solution to over-buying cheap, environmentally unfriendly clothing is self-knowledge.

""The conscious consumer knows themselves,"" said Maldonado, and won't be tempted to ""buy everything and every trend.""

1067,,Jason Proctor Is A Reporter In British Columbia For Cbc News,"Police are searching for a Vancouver man who is the subject of an unprecedented court order to take medication for HIV.

Last October, David Hynd pleaded guilty to violating B.C.'s Public Health Act, marking the first time B.C. medical authorities used the courts to force someone into treatment for the virus that causes AIDS.

But he now faces six counts of breaching the terms of that order — and police are asking for the public's help in locating the 35-year-old, who has allegedly eluded them for more than a month.

Public health officials have agonized over Hynd's case for years, fearful to be seen as criminalizing HIV or contributing to any stigma around the virus.

They say they worked with community care providers to try to force Hynd to comply with health orders — only resorting to the courts as a last step.

""We didn't make the decision lightly, essentially. We really wanted to make sure that we got this individual connected to care both for their own health and the protection of the people around them,"" said Dr. John Harding of Vancouver Coastal Health, the regional health authority.

""It unfortunately has escalated to a level that there now is this probation order and the matter is really behind Mr. Hynd and the police at this point.""

Hynd was given a suspended sentence and a probation order in which he agreed to take regular doses of antiretroviral medication to treat HIV. (Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters)

The case centres on the management of Hynd's HIV.

Health officials want him to take antiretroviral medication that will lower the levels of the human immunodeficiency virus in his blood to a point where he is not considered infectious.

CBC reported on the case last year when Hynd was charged, but did not publish his name because of privacy concerns.

Those factors have changed with the new allegations and the Vancouver police force's request for public assistance.

22 probation conditions

A B.C. provincial court judge gave Hynd a suspended sentence last October after he pleaded guilty to one count of failing to comply with the order of a health officer.

He was given an 18-month probation order that included 22 detailed conditions.

Among them, Hynd was ordered to comply with ""directions, assessments, examinations, treatments and counselling"" from staff at a Vancouver immunodeficiency clinic.

Hynd is the first person B.C. medical authorities have forced, via the courts, into treatment for the virus that cause AIDS. (David Horemans/CBC)

He agreed to pick up antiretroviral medication within one day of receiving a prescription and to ""have sufficient antiretroviral medications in [his] possession"" to avoid an interruption in treatment.

He needs permission from Vancouver Coastal Health to leave British Columbia and must attend daily appointments if the levels of HIV in his blood rise above a certain level.

He must also ""inform all present and future partners"" that he has HIV before any sexual contact, the probation order says. Condoms are also required when ""the exchange of bodily fluids is possible.""

'Very unusual'

According to court documents, Hynd was allegedly late for clinic appointments, changed his residence without telling a health officer and failed to let the clinic know he would be missing an appointment.

He's also accused of failing to show up for daily appointments which were supposed to kick in if he either failed to have tests on a regular basis, or if tests showed his viral load had risen above a level of concern.

Police say Hynd may be driving a black Dodge Ram with an Alberta license plate and is known to frequent downtown Vancouver.

""In general, people with HIV do not pose a risk to the public. This is an individual where it's very unusual,"" said Harding.

""Most people go into treatment both for their own health and for the protection of their partners and the ones around them. In this particular case, it was very challenging to keep this individual on treatment and we used every supportive measure that we had.""

Harding said the case has been difficult for medical authorities to deal with, particularly at a time when Vancouver Coastal Health has been successful in combating the spread of HIV in the Lower Mainland.

""There's only been a handful of people that we've ever even put orders on. And then this is the only individual whereby we've had to take an extraordinary step to enforce that order,"" he said.

""We just don't want that to affect the overall access and people's stigma towards HIV.""",,"['order', 'hynd', 'vancouver', 'case', 'health', 'individual', 'medication', 'hiv', 'treatment', 'probation']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news

Those factors have changed with the new allegations and the Vancouver police force's request for public assistance.

22 probation conditions

A B.C. provincial court judge gave Hynd a suspended sentence last October after he pleaded guilty to one count of failing to comply with the order of a health officer.

He was given an 18-month probation order that included 22 detailed conditions.

Among them, Hynd was ordered to comply with ""directions, assessments, examinations, treatments and counselling"" from staff at a Vancouver immunodeficiency clinic.

He agreed to pick up antiretroviral medication within one day of receiving a prescription and to ""have sufficient antiretroviral medications in [his] possession"" to avoid an interruption in treatment.

He needs permission from Vancouver Coastal Health to leave British Columbia and must attend daily appointments if the levels of HIV in his blood rise above a certain level.

He must also ""inform all present and future partners"" that he has HIV before any sexual contact, the probation order says. Condoms are also required when ""the exchange of bodily fluids is possible.""

'Very unusual'

According to court documents, Hynd was allegedly late for clinic appointments, changed his residence without telling a health officer and failed to let the clinic know he would be missing an appointment.

He's also accused of failing to show up for daily appointments which were supposed to kick in if he either failed to have tests on a regular basis, or if tests showed his viral load had risen above a level of concern.

Police say Hynd may be driving a black Dodge Ram with an Alberta license plate and is known to frequent downtown Vancouver.

""In general, people with HIV do not pose a risk to the public. This is an individual where it's very unusual,"" said Harding.

""Most people go into treatment both for their own health and for the protection of their partners and the ones around them. In this particular case, it was very challenging to keep this individual on treatment and we used every supportive measure that we had.""

Harding said the case has been difficult for medical authorities to deal with, particularly at a time when Vancouver Coastal Health has been successful in combating the spread of HIV in the Lower Mainland.

""There's only been a handful of people that we've ever even put orders on. And then this is the only individual whereby we've had to take an extraordinary step to enforce that order,"" he said.

1069,,Mental Health Issues In The Justice System Extensively.,"Police are searching for a Vancouver man who is the subject of an unprecedented court order to take medication for HIV.

Last October, David Hynd pleaded guilty to violating B.C.'s Public Health Act, marking the first time B.C. medical authorities used the courts to force someone into treatment for the virus that causes AIDS.

But he now faces six counts of breaching the terms of that order — and police are asking for the public's help in locating the 35-year-old, who has allegedly eluded them for more than a month.

Public health officials have agonized over Hynd's case for years, fearful to be seen as criminalizing HIV or contributing to any stigma around the virus.

They say they worked with community care providers to try to force Hynd to comply with health orders — only resorting to the courts as a last step.

""We didn't make the decision lightly, essentially. We really wanted to make sure that we got this individual connected to care both for their own health and the protection of the people around them,"" said Dr. John Harding of Vancouver Coastal Health, the regional health authority.

""It unfortunately has escalated to a level that there now is this probation order and the matter is really behind Mr. Hynd and the police at this point.""

1070,,Cbc News,"Winnipeg health officials are pointing the finger at a local hospital after a Nunavut family learned that the hospital mixed up the bodies of their newborn son and another baby.

The mix-up happened after the baby's death at Winnipeg's St. Boniface Hospital in April. The hospital sent a body to parents Tony Alagalak and Alice Kinak in Arviat, Nunavut, where they held a funeral. It was weeks later, in May, that three hospital officials arrived to explain that the family had been given the wrong baby's body.

It's still not clear how the mistake happened. Officials with St. Boniface have declined to comment. Alagalak said he was told they're still looking into the case.

""They apologized,"" Alagalak said. ""But I know somebody made a mistake there.""

Alagalak doesn't know who the other family is.

He says too many infants die in Nunavut, and wants to see changes to the health-care system in Arviat — which has no doctor or ultrasound equipment — and the rest of the territory.

""I really think my government failed me,"" he said. ""There should be someone here at all times for emergencies like that.""

The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) expressed sympathy but noted each hospital is responsible for its own morgue processes.

""The process for transfer of remains from hospital to families is a responsibility held by each individual hospital,"" said Krista Williams, WRHA's chief health operations officer, in a statement. She said St. Boniface is investigating.

Officials with St. Boniface Hospital have declined to comment on the case. (CBC)

All children's deaths are reported to the office of Manitoba's Chief Medical Examiner, which looks at the cause of death, according to CME director Mark O'Rourke.

He said the death of Alagalak and Kinak's son was reviewed and did not require further investigation, so the body was released back to the doctor.

The Manitoba Nurses Union said it is investigating the case, but declined further comment. CBC News is also seeking comment from Manitoba's health minister.

In an interview with CBC, Francois de Wet, chief of staff for Nunavut’s health department, said they will learn from this situation. (Jordan Konek/CBC)

Nunavut takes some responsibility for what happened, said Francois de Wet, chief of staff for the territory's health department.

""We all take responsibility for it, as the Department of Health, when something happens to any of our clients, you know, we take that as, this is our responsibility,"" de Wet told CBC News.

""And we will go forward to try and find the best way to resolve it and to try and find a way that this will never happen again.""

He said once officials know what happened, they will talk to the family.

""This is an absolute terrible thing that happened,"" he said. ""As a father myself, I can't imagine the trauma that the family went through.""",,"['know', 'responsibility', 'comment', 'health', 'chief', 'st', 'happened', 'family', 'hospital', 'officials']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news
1071,,Parliamentary Bureau,"While the Senate's transport committee recommended the upper house defeat the bill outright, a coalition of Independent and Liberal senators has cobbled together enough votes to rescue legislation to implement the government's planned ban on oil tankers along B.C.'s northern coast.

The outcome was far from certain after the committee that studied the legislation recommended against passing the Liberal plan. The committee issued a scathing report this week saying that, if passed, the bill would stoke a nascent separatist movement in Western Canada, and accused the government of unfairly targeting Alberta's oilpatch at a time of constrained pipeline capacity and cratering oil prices.

The strongly worded report — penned by the committee's chair, Conservative Saskatchewan Sen. David Tkachuk — prompted a backlash of sorts Wednesday night from other senators who called it overly partisan.

Senators rejected the committee's report by a vote of 38 to 53, with one abstention. Now, senators are expected to make amendments at the third reading phase of the legislative process before sending the bill back to the Commons for approval.

The Senate also voted this evening on Bill C-69, the government's controversial overhaul of the environmental assessment process. The Senate's energy committee passed more than 180 amendments to that bill that would, among other things, limit the environment minister's ability to interfere in the regulatory process and stop and start project timelines.

Having passed the Senate, C-69 now returns to the House of Commons with all 180 amendments.

This committee did not function properly and did not function in a collegial matter. I therefore consider it to be a dysfunctional committee. - Sen. Murray Sinclair speaking about Tkachuk's transport committee

While not explicitly written into the Liberal government's 2015 platform, then-third party leader Justin Trudeau vowed to institute a moratorium on oil tankers docking at ports along the northern B.C. coast when unveiling his plan for the environment at a Vancouver-area event in June, 2015.

In describing the legislation, Tkachuk said it is ""not as advertised"" — that it is not a ""moratorium"" at all because there is no set timeline, and should be described as a ban. (The Conservative Party recently launched a series of ads with the tagline, ""Justin Trudeau, not as advertised."")

In the report, Tkachuk said the legislation was motivated not by a desire to protect the pristine Great Bear rainforest but rather by electoral considerations. He said Trudeau is willing to undermine the Prairie economy to court votes elsewhere.

Tkachuk said Trudeau is ""targeting one region, where the political rewards for the government of the day are few, in order to please voters in other regions of Canada — regions where the government of the day has far greater potential to win seats.

""Your committee notes the ruling political party has historically been unable to win a significant number of seats in the region targeted by this bill, and that all credible polls indicate the ruling party will be unable to win a significant number of seats in the upcoming federal election.""

Independent Quebec Sen. Andre Pratte said that, while he opposed parts of the tanker ban bill and will offer amendments at the third reading stage, he thought Tkachuk's report did a disservice to the committee's deliberations on the legislation.

While many reports are produced with a degree of consensus — with contributions from members of the committee from different parties — the committee's deputy chair, Independent Quebec Sen. Julie Miville-Dechêne, said there was no such offer from Tkachuk.

""He said no to any steering committee, as usual. We were therefore unable to decide in a collegial manner how to go about writing the report. My only priority then became to ensure that whatever report was prepared would be put before the Senate promptly so that we can all vote on it,"" the senator told her colleagues.

""I therefore urge you to emphatically reject this 21-page report, which does a disservice to the Senate and does not do justice to the diversity of opinion among the 139 witnesses who appeared before us.""

However, while she was critical of the Tkachuk report, Miville-Dechêne and other dissenting senators did not draft a minority report to respond to the Tory-penned document.

Independent Manitoba Sen. Murray Sinclair said the transport committee is clearly ""dysfunctional,"" given how much bickering there was between members at its meetings and in the chamber Wednesday.

""It's appearing to me, from being here, that this committee did not function properly and did not function in a collegial matter. I therefore consider it to be a dysfunctional committee,"" the former judge said.

""The committee did not appear to be able to get along very well in its work and deliberations, and that causes me concern because now we are being asked to be parties to this report as members of the chamber.""

Sen. Murray Sinclair: The transport committee is 'dysfunctional.' (CBC)

The ""dysfunction"" label prompted claims of unparliamentary language from the Conservative opposition, with one senator saying the description ""defamed"" the work of the committee.

Independent Quebec Sen. Rosa Galvez said the mood at the transport committee, of which she is a member, was ""extremely unpleasant"" under Tkachuk's leadership.

She said the committee's travel, to locations in B.C., Alberta, and Saskatchewan, was essentially a waste of time because dissenting voices were all but excluded from Tkachuk's final report.

""A cost-benefit analysis of this report would be absolutely scandalous,"" Galvez said.

""Overall, I got the feeling that our work was being undermined and even sabotaged. Rather than conducting an in-depth analysis of Bill C-48, of its weaknesses and limitations, so that we could suggest amendments and make observations that could be effective in improving it, we created a hostile and aggressive atmosphere that prevented the legislation from being studied in the best interests of Canadians.""

Galvez said her colleague, Independent Alberta Sen. Paula Simons — who sided with the Tories to vote down Bill C-48 at committee — was ""harassed"" to vote a certain way.

Tkachuk defended the committee's work and the report it produced.

""This was not a waste of time. This was the Senate at its best,"" he said of the committee's travels.

He said the bill, which would ban tankers capable of carrying more than 12,500 metric tons of oil from an area that stretches from the northern tip of Vancouver Island to the Alaska border, is ""so egregiously bad that it should be stopped in its tracks.""

""Your committee has concluded from the varied and quite passionate testimony put before it, from a broad range of witnesses who appeared in Ottawa, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, that Bill C-48 is both divisive and discriminatory,"" Tkachuk said.

He said the legislation, which does nothing about oil tanker traffic in Eastern Canada, serves only to bolster a growing Western Canadian separatist movement.

""The feeling of resentment, I can tell you, is palpable and any legislation that pours fuel on that particular fire should not be allowed to proceed,"" Tkachuk said.

He said the bill will cost ""us all,"" as it imperils the future of Alberta's oilpatch and conventional oil development in Saskatchewan — two major economic drivers for the Canadian economy.

If enacted, the ban would frustrate future pipeline projects like the now-defunct Northern Gateway project, or the proposed Indigenous-led Eagle Spirit pipeline.

""Your committee strongly maintains that targeting one region of Canada for economic punishment is unconstitutional and destructive to the fabric of Canadian federalism,"" Tkachuk said.",,"['tkachuk', 'legislation', 'sen', 'committees', 'transport', 'bill', 'committee', 'oil', 'report', 'senate']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news

In describing the legislation, Tkachuk said it is ""not as advertised"" — that it is not a ""moratorium"" at all because there is no set timeline, and should be described as a ban. (The Conservative Party recently launched a series of ads with the tagline, ""Justin Trudeau, not as advertised."")

In the report, Tkachuk said the legislation was motivated not by a desire to protect the pristine Great Bear rainforest but rather by electoral considerations. He said Trudeau is willing to undermine the Prairie economy to court votes elsewhere.

Tkachuk said Trudeau is ""targeting one region, where the political rewards for the government of the day are few, in order to please voters in other regions of Canada — regions where the government of the day has far greater potential to win seats.

""Your committee notes the ruling political party has historically been unable to win a significant number of seats in the region targeted by this bill, and that all credible polls indicate the ruling party will be unable to win a significant number of seats in the upcoming federal election.""

Independent Quebec Sen. Andre Pratte said that, while he opposed parts of the tanker ban bill and will offer amendments at the third reading stage, he thought Tkachuk's report did a disservice to the committee's deliberations on the legislation.

While many reports are produced with a degree of consensus — with contributions from members of the committee from different parties — the committee's deputy chair, Independent Quebec Sen. Julie Miville-Dechêne, said there was no such offer from Tkachuk.

""He said no to any steering committee, as usual. We were therefore unable to decide in a collegial manner how to go about writing the report. My only priority then became to ensure that whatever report was prepared would be put before the Senate promptly so that we can all vote on it,"" the senator told her colleagues.

""I therefore urge you to emphatically reject this 21-page report, which does a disservice to the Senate and does not do justice to the diversity of opinion among the 139 witnesses who appeared before us.""

However, while she was critical of the Tkachuk report, Miville-Dechêne and other dissenting senators did not draft a minority report to respond to the Tory-penned document.

Independent Manitoba Sen. Murray Sinclair said the transport committee is clearly ""dysfunctional,"" given how much bickering there was between members at its meetings and in the chamber Wednesday.

""It's appearing to me, from being here, that this committee did not function properly and did not function in a collegial matter. I therefore consider it to be a dysfunctional committee,"" the former judge said.

""The committee did not appear to be able to get along very well in its work and deliberations, and that causes me concern because now we are being asked to be parties to this report as members of the chamber.""

The ""dysfunction"" label prompted claims of unparliamentary language from the Conservative opposition, with one senator saying the description ""defamed"" the work of the committee.

Independent Quebec Sen. Rosa Galvez said the mood at the transport committee, of which she is a member, was ""extremely unpleasant"" under Tkachuk's leadership.

She said the committee's travel, to locations in B.C., Alberta, and Saskatchewan, was essentially a waste of time because dissenting voices were all but excluded from Tkachuk's final report.

""A cost-benefit analysis of this report would be absolutely scandalous,"" Galvez said.

""Overall, I got the feeling that our work was being undermined and even sabotaged. Rather than conducting an in-depth analysis of Bill C-48, of its weaknesses and limitations, so that we could suggest amendments and make observations that could be effective in improving it, we created a hostile and aggressive atmosphere that prevented the legislation from being studied in the best interests of Canadians.""

Galvez said her colleague, Independent Alberta Sen. Paula Simons — who sided with the Tories to vote down Bill C-48 at committee — was ""harassed"" to vote a certain way.

Tkachuk defended the committee's work and the report it produced.

""This was not a waste of time. This was the Senate at its best,"" he said of the committee's travels.

He said the bill, which would ban tankers capable of carrying more than 12,500 metric tons of oil from an area that stretches from the northern tip of Vancouver Island to the Alaska border, is ""so egregiously bad that it should be stopped in its tracks.""

""Your committee has concluded from the varied and quite passionate testimony put before it, from a broad range of witnesses who appeared in Ottawa, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, that Bill C-48 is both divisive and discriminatory,"" Tkachuk said.

He said the legislation, which does nothing about oil tanker traffic in Eastern Canada, serves only to bolster a growing Western Canadian separatist movement.

""The feeling of resentment, I can tell you, is palpable and any legislation that pours fuel on that particular fire should not be allowed to proceed,"" Tkachuk said.

He said the bill will cost ""us all,"" as it imperils the future of Alberta's oilpatch and conventional oil development in Saskatchewan — two major economic drivers for the Canadian economy.

If enacted, the ban would frustrate future pipeline projects like the now-defunct Northern Gateway project, or the proposed Indigenous-led Eagle Spirit pipeline.

""Your committee strongly maintains that targeting one region of Canada for economic punishment is unconstitutional and destructive to the fabric of Canadian federalism,"" Tkachuk said.",,"['tkachuk', 'legislation', 'sen', 'committees', 'transport', 'bill', 'committee', 'oil', 'report', 'senate']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news
1075,,Follow J.P. On Twitter,"While the Senate's transport committee recommended the upper house defeat the bill outright, a coalition of Independent and Liberal senators has cobbled together enough votes to rescue legislation to implement the government's planned ban on oil tankers along B.C.'s northern coast.

The outcome was far from certain after the committee that studied the legislation recommended against passing the Liberal plan. The committee issued a scathing report this week saying that, if passed, the bill would stoke a nascent separatist movement in Western Canada, and accused the government of unfairly targeting Alberta's oilpatch at a time of constrained pipeline capacity and cratering oil prices.

The strongly worded report — penned by the committee's chair, Conservative Saskatchewan Sen. David Tkachuk — prompted a backlash of sorts Wednesday night from other senators who called it overly partisan.

Senators rejected the committee's report by a vote of 38 to 53, with one abstention. Now, senators are expected to make amendments at the third reading phase of the legislative process before sending the bill back to the Commons for approval.

The Senate also voted this evening on Bill C-69, the government's controversial overhaul of the environmental assessment process. The Senate's energy committee passed more than 180 amendments to that bill that would, among other things, limit the environment minister's ability to interfere in the regulatory process and stop and start project timelines.

Having passed the Senate, C-69 now returns to the House of Commons with all 180 amendments.

1076,,Cbc News,"People in Gatineau, Que., aren't the only ones in Canada frustrated with the skunky stink from nearby cannabis grow operations.

Production facilities have continued to pop up since the drug was legalized across the country last year, but some of their new neighbours aren't pleased with the smell.

""In my experience, the smell of the actual growing of the plant does not represent health concerns, but at the same time I fully accept that it can affect the quality of people's lives and their enjoyment of their properties,"" said Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair in a recent interview.

Licensed producers are obligated to ""prevent odours and other annoyances and pollutants from emanating from their premises,"" and the regulations to that effect are ""quite strict,"" he said.

But not all producers are heeding them.

Gatineau, Que., resident Virginie Roussin lives down the street from Hexo, a cannabis producer. Roussin says the smell of pot production at the plant is overwhelming. (Radio-Canada)

In Gatineau, the smell from a Hexo plant has become so intolerable that Virginie Roussin no longer hangs her laundry out to dry or leaves her windows open.

""Last Sunday we opened a bit of my son's room [window] and we closed the door. Afterward when we came back at night, it was like we smoked a joint in the room,"" she said.

CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning reached out to some municipalities west of Ottawa also dealing with the same problem.

'Somebody has to step up'

Rich Coleman, the MLA for Langley East in B.C., said there are four cannabis facilities causing a big stink in two communities.

""It is actually very bad. I have one family where the wife ... leaves the home up to four times a week to go stay with a relative because of the migraine headaches that the odour is bringing forward,"" he said.

""Somebody has to step up and either shut these places down or make them get their act together, because if they're allowed to just go on and not be enforced, it will continue to be a large problem.""

Langley East MLA Rich Coleman says someone needs to step up to enforce the law that cannabis producers must control their odours. (CBC)

Coleman said the company involved isn't tackling the problem with proper air filtration, but is instead trying to mask the odour with a sweet smell.

""Basically what they're doing is they're putting Febreeze-smelling-type oil through these cannons to try and mitigate the smell, which just makes it a sweeter stink. It doesn't change anything,"" he said.

He's written to the federal attorney general and the health minister to try to get the odour control law enforced.

'Getting better'

In Pelham, Ont., which sits in the Niagara Region, Mayor Marvin Junkin said there are two big cannabis operations that have been generating complaints, but that the situation is slowly improving.

""I would actually say in the last six months they have both tried to become good corporate citizens, and they are slowly but surely investing more money into their exhaust system. So it is actually getting better here,"" he said.

Masson-Angers residents living near a cannabis company there aren't the only ones fed up with the stink of cannabis cultivation centres. We hear why political rep's for both Langley, B.C. and Pelham, Ontario think the federal government should be doing more. 10:23

In October 2018, the municipality passed a bylaw forbidding any new cannabis grow-ops from setting up for a year, in order to allow municipal staff to study what's being done elsewhere and come up with adequate bylaws.

1077,,The Associated Press,"Dr. John, the New Orleans musician who blended black and white musical styles with a hoodoo-infused stage persona and gravelly bayou drawl, has died. He was 77.

In a statement released through his publicist, the family of Dr. John said he died ""toward the break of day"" on Thursday of a heart attack. There were no details about where he died.

Dr. John — who was born Mac Rebennack — had not been seen in public much since late 2017, when he cancelled several gigs. He had been resting at his New Orleans area home, publicist Karen Beninato said last year in an interview.

""The family thanks all whom have shared his unique musical journey and requests privacy at this time,"" the statement said. Memorial arrangements were being planned.

Rebennack's spooky 1968 debut Gris-Gris combined rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and startled listeners with its sinister implications of other-worldly magic. He later had a Top 10 hit with Right Place, Wrong Time, collaborated with numerous top-tier rockers, won multiple Grammy awards and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

A white man who found a home among black New Orleans musicians, he first entered the music scene when he accompanied his father, who ran a record shop and also fixed P.A. systems at New Orleans bars.

As a teenager in the 1950s, he played guitar and keyboards in a string of bands and made the legendary studio of Cosimo Matassa his second home, Rebennack said in his 1994 memoir, Under a Hoodoo Moon.

He got into music full-time after dropping out of high school, became acquainted with drugs and petty crime and lived a fast-paced life. His gigs ranged from strip clubs to auditoriums, roadhouses and chicken shacks. The ring finger of Rebennack's left hand was blown off in a shooting incident in 1961 in Jacksonville, Fla.

Collaborated with numerous artists

He blamed Jim Garrison, the JFK conspiracy theorist and a tough-on-crime New Orleans district attorney, for driving him out of his beloved city in the early 1960s. Garrison went after prostitutes, bars and all-night music venues.

The underworld sweep put Rebennack in prison. At that time, he was a respected session musician who had played on classic recordings by R&B mainstays like Professor Longhair and Irma Thomas, but he was also a heroin addict. After his release from federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas, at 24, Rebennack joined friend and mentor Harold Battiste who had left New Orleans to make music in Los Angeles.

Rebennack, who'd long had a fascination with occult mysticism and voodoo, told Battiste about creating a musical personality out of Dr. John, a male version of Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen.

In his memoir, Rebennack said, he drew inspiration from New Orleans folklore about a root doctor who flourished in the mid-1800s.

In a 2005 interview, Battiste recalled, ""It was really done sort of tongue-in-cheek.""

But Dr. John was born and Rebennack got his first personal recordings done in what became Gris-Gris, a classic of underground American music.

In the years that followed, he played with The Grateful Dead, appeared with The Band in director Martin Scorsese's The Last Waltz documentary, jammed on The Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street album and collaborated with countless others — among them Ringo Starr, Carly Simon, Earl King, Van Morrison, Angelique Kidjo and James Booker.

He needed help, though — someone to hold the 94-year-old former Bren gunner and artilleryman steady as he dipped his foot in the pounding surf of Juno Beach one last time.

""My heart was telling me to go and walk in the water,"" the former corporal with the Régiment de Maisonneuve de Montreal said today.

Trempe was among a handful of old soldiers who chose to step into the waves off Normandy today — waters which, three-quarters of a century ago, were choked with blood, bodies and wreckage.

He said he knew the moment would reawaken long-sleeping ghosts of the humid, violent summer of 1944. But it was a price he was prepared to pay to honour a youth spent on the knife's edge of a world war — an experience that seemed incomprehensible to the thousands of people of all ages who gathered today to commemorate the triumph of the D-Day landings 75 years ago.

""Maybe tonight, or tomorrow night, I'm going to wake up suddenly and think about it,"" Trempe said in French as he returned from the beach.

'Thank you so much for coming'

Some of the Canadian veterans walked down to the surf, while others had to be wheeled down to the beach where 14,000 Canadian troops stormed ashore on June 6, 1944 to begin the invasion that signalled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.

A crowd of locals stood by cheering as the veterans made what, for many of them, was almost certainly their last visit to the scene of one of the 20th century's most important battles.

Juno Beach was one of five Allied landing zones on D-Day — the place where 359 Canadians were killed and over 700 others wounded and captured.

He said he knew the moment would reawaken long-sleeping ghosts of the humid, violent summer of 1944.

'Thank you so much for coming'

Some of the Canadian veterans walked down to the surf, while others had to be wheeled down to the beach where 14,000 Canadian troops stormed ashore on June 6, 1944 to begin the invasion that signalled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.

A crowd of locals stood by cheering as the veterans made what, for many of them, was almost certainly their last visit to the scene of one of the 20th century's most important battles.

Juno Beach was one of five Allied landing zones on D-Day — the place where 359 Canadians were killed and over 700 others wounded and captured.

Even 75 years after, Anderson said, the place has lost none of its symbolic power and significance as ""a place for all soldiers.""

Canada's current top military commander walked down to the beach with the veterans. Afterward, Gen. Jonathan Vance struggled to put his feelings into words.

1088,,Thomson Reuters,"More than a million people worldwide catch a sexually transmitted infection every day, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.

Four infections — chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and syphilis — account for a combined total of more than 376 million new cases annually, the WHO said in a report.

The vast majority of the infections are easily preventable and curable, the organization said, but some diseases, especially gonorrhea, are evolving into superbug forms that are increasingly difficult to treat with antibiotics.

""Sexually transmitted infections are everywhere. They are far more common than we think,"" said Teodora Wi, a medical officer in the WHO's department for reproductive health and research.

The report, based on 2016 global data — the most recent available — showed 127 million new cases of chlamydia that year, along with 87 million cases of gonorrhea, six million cases of syphilis and 156 million cases of trichomoniasis among men and women aged 15 to 49.

Sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, are a ""persistent and endemic health threat worldwide"" and have a profound impact on both adult and child health, the WHO said.

If left untreated, they can lead to serious and chronic health effects that include neurological and cardiovascular disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths and an increased risk of HIV.

Syphilis alone caused an estimated 200,000 stillbirths and newborn deaths in 2016, making it one of the leading causes of baby loss globally, the research said.

Rates of infection haven't declined since 2012, the World Health Organization said.

""We're seeing a concerning lack of progress in stopping the spread of sexually transmitted infections,"" said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO's executive director for universal health coverage, in a news statement.

""This is a wake-up call for a concerted effort to ensure everyone, everywhere can access the services they need to prevent and treat these debilitating diseases.""

Sexual infections caused by bacteria can normally be treated and cured with widely available medicines, but the WHO study said recent shortages in the global supply of benzathine penicillin had made it more difficult to control syphilis. Rising drug resistance to gonorrhea treatments is also a growing health threat.

Tim Jinks, a specialist in infectious disease at Britain's Wellcome Trust global health charity, said the increase in cases of STIs was alarming, especially given that some antibiotics are becoming less effective due to drug resistance.

""The high numbers of cases of gonorrhea are of particular concern,"" he said in an emailed comment to Reuters. ""We are increasingly seeing incidences of so-called 'super-gonorrhea' which are practically impossible to treat.""

1089,,Consumer Watchdog,"It was bad enough the Halifax moving company arrived hours late to the family's new home in Toronto, delivered only a portion of their belongings, and that many were broken.

The ultimate kick in the pants was a $452 invoice for illegal dumping the family received after many of their missing items, including dining room chairs, were found discarded 30 kilometres away in a Mississauga, Ont., business park.

Now Jens Casten and his family are issuing a public warning about Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers, after losing thousands of dollars worth of items, some of them irreplaceable.

""What they're doing is despicable,"" Casten said.

The case highlights, according to one industry group, the pressing need for the federal government to step in and regulate the moving industry, where there are no rules and complaints about fly-by-night businesses are common.

The Casten family's nightmare started in June 2018 when Jens Casten found Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers on Kijiji after deciding to move from Halifax to Toronto for work reasons. He said their rates and reviews were good, so he called.

There's uncertainty surrounding those reviews. But the name is the same as another company, Big Boys Movers in St. John's, whose owner said is not affiliated and has even posted a notice online warning people after fielding complaints about the Halifax business.

After contacting Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers, Casten said three professional-looking men came to his home, walked through, and gave him a price.

The quote was more than he wanted to pay so he asked them to lower it, which they did. He said he was given a contract that was signed with only the first name Sam.

Casten had the company store his belongings for several months in Halifax while his family lived in a furnished rental in Toronto before moving into their permanent home.

He was told everything would be at a reputable storage company, so he paid the $1,100 fee. He also paid another $1,050 upfront to cover half the cost of the move.

Delivery nightmare

However, he had no idea what lay ahead until the moving truck arrived in Toronto in April. At first, the movers refused to take off anything until he paid the second half of the moving costs. He finally gave them $500.

""The first piece they unloaded was the headboard of our $3,000 king-sized bed and it was severely damaged,"" Casten said, adding the side rails and slats for the bed were missing.

Their children's beds were not delivered. Neither were the pillows for the couch. Neither were the chairs that go with their dining room set, chairs he said will cost $1,000 to replace.

Some of their belongings had been chewed and damaged by rodents. Mementos from Casten's 21-year professional hockey career in Germany were never delivered.

""My trophies, all the pictures. It's all gone. That stuff will never be replaced,"" he said.

He and his wife tried countless times to contact the company via voicemail and text messages.

""There was absolutely no response,"" he said.

The Casten family had no idea what awaited them as they prepared to move from Halifax to Toronto. (Megan Casten)

He went to Toronto police to file a complaint but he was told it was a civil, not a criminal matter.

At that point, he and his wife felt there was nothing more they could do so they put the experience behind them.

But the worst was yet to come.

On May 2, Casten received an emailed $452 invoice from Colliers International in Mississauga for illegal dumping. It said video footage had captured the dumping, and that personal items identified him as the owner.

It also said he had 30 days to pay, a report had been filed with police, and further action may be taken.

""At first I thought it was a scam,"" Casten said.

'That's pure insanity'

When he opened the attachments and saw pictures of his stuff strewn across pavement beside a dumpster, he said he couldn't believe it. There were four of his dining room chairs, his daughter's bike, his coat, and boxes of other belongings.

""That's pure insanity,"" Casten said. ""It makes absolutely no sense to transport all our stuff from Halifax to Toronto on a truck and then just dump it.""

Casten immediately called Colliers, happy he would get his belongings back. But joy was replaced with devastation when he was told everything had already been disposed of.

Even though he explained the situation, he was told he would still have to pay for the cleanup.

After CBC News contacted the company and asked for a copy of the video, Colliers International spokesperson Stephen Hall responded in an email: ""Upon further investigation, our video cameras unfortunately did not record the incident.""

He also said that based on new information, Colliers ""will be rescinding"" its invoice to Casten.

Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers did not respond to multiple voicemails and texts asking for comment. CBC was unable to find any record of the company on the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks, even though the law requires all businesses operating in the province to register, with a few exceptions.

This is the contract Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers gave to the Castens. It says they are covered by insurance, but then the company refused to identify the insurer. (Submitted by Jens Casten)

Casten's experience comes as no surprise to Nancy Irvine, president of the Canadian Association of Movers.

""It's not unusual for low-price, bargain movers that have such a differential price from a professional moving company to pull antics like this and charge more money in order to get your things back, or disappear with your things, or to throw them away if they don't get the money,"" Irvine said.

She said the problem is a big one, although no one is tracking its scope. Irvine said her association gets about 20 to 30 complaints a year.

She said the problem is the result of industry deregulation in the mid 1980s.

""There are no industry standards, so you and I could get a moving company together tomorrow,"" she said. ""We don't need to have a licence, we don't need to have workers compensation, we don't need to have insurance and we don't even have to have trained guys. We could just get a pickup truck and off we go and we're movers.""

She said her organization has lobbied the federal government several times over the past decade but was told there were more important things to deal with.

Reinstating licences for moving companies, she said, would help weed out the bad guys.

Irvine said customers like Casten have very little recourse when something happens since police are reluctant to get involved. She urged anyone looking for a mover to check the Canadian Association of Movers website for a reputable company.

As for Casten, he now realizes he would have actually saved money if he went with a reputable, more expensive mover.

""I hope people learn from this,"" he said. ""I tried to take a shortcut, but at the end of the day I've learned a lesson the hard way and I hope that my lesson will be a warning for other people.""

He and his wife tried countless times to contact the company via voicemail and text messages.

""There was absolutely no response,"" he said.

The Casten family had no idea what awaited them as they prepared to move from Halifax to Toronto. (Megan Casten)

He went to Toronto police to file a complaint but he was told it was a civil, not a criminal matter.

At that point, he and his wife felt there was nothing more they could do so they put the experience behind them.

But the worst was yet to come.

On May 2, Casten received an emailed $452 invoice from Colliers International in Mississauga for illegal dumping. It said video footage had captured the dumping, and that personal items identified him as the owner.

It also said he had 30 days to pay, a report had been filed with police, and further action may be taken.

""At first I thought it was a scam,"" Casten said.

'That's pure insanity'

When he opened the attachments and saw pictures of his stuff strewn across pavement beside a dumpster, he said he couldn't believe it. There were four of his dining room chairs, his daughter's bike, his coat, and boxes of other belongings.

""That's pure insanity,"" Casten said. ""It makes absolutely no sense to transport all our stuff from Halifax to Toronto on a truck and then just dump it.""

Casten immediately called Colliers, happy he would get his belongings back. But joy was replaced with devastation when he was told everything had already been disposed of.

Even though he explained the situation, he was told he would still have to pay for the cleanup.

After CBC News contacted the company and asked for a copy of the video, Colliers International spokesperson Stephen Hall responded in an email: ""Upon further investigation, our video cameras unfortunately did not record the incident.""

He also said that based on new information, Colliers ""will be rescinding"" its invoice to Casten.

Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers did not respond to multiple voicemails and texts asking for comment. CBC was unable to find any record of the company on the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks, even though the law requires all businesses operating in the province to register, with a few exceptions.

This is the contract Big Boys Movers/Halifax Movers gave to the Castens. It says they are covered by insurance, but then the company refused to identify the insurer. (Submitted by Jens Casten)

Casten's experience comes as no surprise to Nancy Irvine, president of the Canadian Association of Movers.

""It's not unusual for low-price, bargain movers that have such a differential price from a professional moving company to pull antics like this and charge more money in order to get your things back, or disappear with your things, or to throw them away if they don't get the money,"" Irvine said.

She said the problem is a big one, although no one is tracking its scope. Irvine said her association gets about 20 to 30 complaints a year.

She said the problem is the result of industry deregulation in the mid 1980s.

""There are no industry standards, so you and I could get a moving company together tomorrow,"" she said. ""We don't need to have a licence, we don't need to have workers compensation, we don't need to have insurance and we don't even have to have trained guys. We could just get a pickup truck and off we go and we're movers.""

She said her organization has lobbied the federal government several times over the past decade but was told there were more important things to deal with.

Reinstating licences for moving companies, she said, would help weed out the bad guys.

Irvine said customers like Casten have very little recourse when something happens since police are reluctant to get involved. She urged anyone looking for a mover to check the Canadian Association of Movers website for a reputable company.

As for Casten, he now realizes he would have actually saved money if he went with a reputable, more expensive mover.

""I hope people learn from this,"" he said. ""I tried to take a shortcut, but at the end of the day I've learned a lesson the hard way and I hope that my lesson will be a warning for other people.""

1094,Sports-no-CBC,Los Angeles Correspondent,"It was the first day of June basketball camp at Martin Luther King High School in Riverside, about 90 kilometres east of Los Angeles. Of course there was talent on the court, but the next Kawhi Leonard? A long shot.

Coaching a star of that calibre was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, said Jeff Dietz, who was part of the coaching staff when Leonard landed at the California school in 2007.

""You know, it's hard to sit here and say that I thought he was going to be arguably [among] the best five players in the world,"" said Dietz, who is now the head coach of the high school team. ""But we knew he was special.""

Dietz said one of the first things that struck him when Leonard arrived was the size of the young player's hands.

""Everybody knows about his hands, right?"" Dietz said of the Raptors star, who has been instrumental in driving the Toronto team to the NBA Finals. ""The span of his hands are the span of a seven foot guy and his wingspan is that of a seven-three guy.""

After practice, tasked with picking up loose basketballs, Leonard was able to palm them up with one hand as though they were tennis balls. But despite his physical gifts, Dietz said some college scouts were put off by his low-key demeanour.

What set Kawhi Leonard apart, even at an early age, Dietz says, was his work ethic. (Martin Luther King HS)

""Kawhi was not a guy who's out there pumping his chest and and getting all crazy,"" Dietz said.

Instead, Dietz said, Leonard let his game do the talking for him.

""When you put a kid on a high school basketball court that can score from all five positions, who can defend all five positions, as a coach you can kind of just need to get out of the way,"" Dietz said.

Work ethic — and lots of drive

But what made Leonard special wasn't just his versatility or his big hands, it was his drive, Dietz said.

A decade after Leonard graduated, stories of his legendary work ethic — how he would get up at 5 a.m. to practice before school, then drill after the team's daily practice — are inspiring the school's current players.

Fifteen-year-old Kenneth Clayton's brother played with Leonard. Clayton said his brother was full of stories about how hard his teammate worked at his game, a lesson the teen said transcends basketball.

""For me that's saying that from anywhere, and anyplace, anyone can get better,"" Clayton said.

As Leonard and the Raptors take on Oakland's Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, Clayton and many of the students at the school find themselves cheering for a team based in another country, against a team from their own state.

""I'm going for the Raptors,"" Clayton said. ""I don't know if they'll win, but I'm still going for them.""

The staff and students at the high school were admittedly conflicted in April during the Raptors first-round series with Milwaukee, because Tony Snell, who also starred with Leonard at King in 2009, played for the Bucks. Snell scored a playoff career high 19 points against the Raptors in Game 4, but the Bucks lost the series in six games.

Now, Dietz said, the high school is firmly behind Leonard.

""We want him to know that the second biggest fan base of the Toronto Raptors are in Riverside,"" Dietz said.

But for how much longer?

Rumours are swirling that Leonard might not opt to extend his contract with the Raptors for another year, and choose instead to enter free agency.

Two Los Angeles-based NBA teams are vying for his signature, and seem willing to go to great lengths to convince the California native to come home. The L.A. Clippers were recently fined $50,000 US for violating the league's anti-tampering rule when coach Doc Rivers compared Leonard to Michael Jordan in a TV appearance.

Jim Alexander, a Riverside-based columnist for the Southern California News Group who has covered Leonard since his high school days, said he thinks it's unlikely Leonard will be swayed by the glitz and glamour of playing in Tinseltown.

""He doesn't seem to be in it for the fame or the glory or the money, although you know he's going to get handsomely paid this summer,"" Alexander said.

Even though many Southern Californians are hoping Leonard will eventually join the pantheon of statues outside the Staples Center that immortalize L.A. basketball heroes like Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal, Alexander isn't so sure.

""I think he will stay in Toronto,"" Alexander said, though he's quick to add it's just a hunch.

""I just think given his nature, given his priorities, he seems to have enjoyed it in Toronto,"" the columnist said. ""Coming back home to Southern California, that's a powerful lure. But you get back home and then all of a sudden you have all of your friends bugging you for tickets and whatnot, so I don't know.""

Surprisingly, former King basketball player Maurice Jones said he would be fine with seeing Leonard stay in Toronto.

Jones was in Grade 8 when he saw Leonard lead the King High Wolves to one of two southern California basketball titles.

""He dunked it on somebody,"" Jones said with a laugh. ""I already knew he was going to be amazing. The moment I'd seen him play, I was like, this guy's gonna be a superstar no matter what.""

After Jones's contract with a basketball team in Argentina ended earlier this year, he returned to Riverside and is now helping out his old coach at the basketball camp. Of course he would love to see Leonard play in person in Los Angeles, Jones said. But he thinks Leonard should stay put.

""It's always nice to come home, but if you're winning titles at a place and building a new legacy over there I might as well just stay over there,"" Jones said.

Dietz points to a picture of Kawhi Leonard and Tony Snell, who now plays with the Milwaukee Bucks, saying he feels 'real lucky to be just part of it.' (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)

Whether the Raptors will actually take that title is an open question. After a big win in Oakland on Wednesday night, Toronto is leading the series 2-1 going into Game 4.

Back at the basketball camp, as the first day came to an end, the kids gathered in a circle, where Dietz led them in a cheer.

""1-2-3 Kawhi!"" they shouted in unison.

As the series continues this week, many of these children from Riverside will be watching — and cheering for — the Raptors and the team's quiet leader.

""We're jumping on that bandwagon and supporting him,"" Dietz said. ""So I hope somewhere down deep inside he feels it.""","It was the first day of June basketball camp at Martin Luther King High School in Riverside, about 90 kilometres east of Los Angeles.

Whether the Raptors will actually take that title is an open question. After a big win in Oakland on Wednesday night, Toronto is leading the series 2-1 going into Game 4.

Back at the basketball camp, as the first day came to an end, the kids gathered in a circle, where Dietz led them in a cheer.

""1-2-3 Kawhi!"" they shouted in unison.

1098,Sports-no-CBC,Radio,"It was the first day of June basketball camp at Martin Luther King High School in Riverside, about 90 kilometres east of Los Angeles. Of course there was talent on the court, but the next Kawhi Leonard? A long shot.

Coaching a star of that calibre was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, said Jeff Dietz, who was part of the coaching staff when Leonard landed at the California school in 2007.

""You know, it's hard to sit here and say that I thought he was going to be arguably [among] the best five players in the world,"" said Dietz, who is now the head coach of the high school team. ""But we knew he was special.""

Dietz said one of the first things that struck him when Leonard arrived was the size of the young player's hands.

""Everybody knows about his hands, right?"" Dietz said of the Raptors star, who has been instrumental in driving the Toronto team to the NBA Finals. ""The span of his hands are the span of a seven foot guy and his wingspan is that of a seven-three guy.""

After practice, tasked with picking up loose basketballs, Leonard was able to palm them up with one hand as though they were tennis balls. But despite his physical gifts, Dietz said some college scouts were put off by his low-key demeanour.

What set Kawhi Leonard apart, even at an early age, Dietz says, was his work ethic. (Martin Luther King HS)

""Kawhi was not a guy who's out there pumping his chest and and getting all crazy,"" Dietz said.

Instead, Dietz said, Leonard let his game do the talking for him.

""When you put a kid on a high school basketball court that can score from all five positions, who can defend all five positions, as a coach you can kind of just need to get out of the way,"" Dietz said.

Work ethic — and lots of drive

But what made Leonard special wasn't just his versatility or his big hands, it was his drive, Dietz said.

A decade after Leonard graduated, stories of his legendary work ethic — how he would get up at 5 a.m. to practice before school, then drill after the team's daily practice — are inspiring the school's current players.

Fifteen-year-old Kenneth Clayton's brother played with Leonard. Clayton said his brother was full of stories about how hard his teammate worked at his game, a lesson the teen said transcends basketball.

""For me that's saying that from anywhere, and anyplace, anyone can get better,"" Clayton said.

As Leonard and the Raptors take on Oakland's Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, Clayton and many of the students at the school find themselves cheering for a team based in another country, against a team from their own state.

""I'm going for the Raptors,"" Clayton said. ""I don't know if they'll win, but I'm still going for them.""

The staff and students at the high school were admittedly conflicted in April during the Raptors first-round series with Milwaukee, because Tony Snell, who also starred with Leonard at King in 2009, played for the Bucks. Snell scored a playoff career high 19 points against the Raptors in Game 4, but the Bucks lost the series in six games.

Now, Dietz said, the high school is firmly behind Leonard.

""We want him to know that the second biggest fan base of the Toronto Raptors are in Riverside,"" Dietz said.

But for how much longer?

Rumours are swirling that Leonard might not opt to extend his contract with the Raptors for another year, and choose instead to enter free agency.

Two Los Angeles-based NBA teams are vying for his signature, and seem willing to go to great lengths to convince the California native to come home. The L.A. Clippers were recently fined $50,000 US for violating the league's anti-tampering rule when coach Doc Rivers compared Leonard to Michael Jordan in a TV appearance.

Jim Alexander, a Riverside-based columnist for the Southern California News Group who has covered Leonard since his high school days, said he thinks it's unlikely Leonard will be swayed by the glitz and glamour of playing in Tinseltown.

""He doesn't seem to be in it for the fame or the glory or the money, although you know he's going to get handsomely paid this summer,"" Alexander said.

Even though many Southern Californians are hoping Leonard will eventually join the pantheon of statues outside the Staples Center that immortalize L.A. basketball heroes like Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal, Alexander isn't so sure.

""I think he will stay in Toronto,"" Alexander said, though he's quick to add it's just a hunch.

""I just think given his nature, given his priorities, he seems to have enjoyed it in Toronto,"" the columnist said. ""Coming back home to Southern California, that's a powerful lure. But you get back home and then all of a sudden you have all of your friends bugging you for tickets and whatnot, so I don't know.""

Surprisingly, former King basketball player Maurice Jones said he would be fine with seeing Leonard stay in Toronto.

Jones was in Grade 8 when he saw Leonard lead the King High Wolves to one of two southern California basketball titles.

""You know, it's hard to sit here and say that I thought he was going to be arguably [among] the best five players in the world,"" said Dietz, who is now the head coach of the high school team. ""But we knew he was special.""

Dietz said one of the first things that struck him when Leonard arrived was the size of the young player's hands.

""Everybody knows about his hands, right?"" Dietz said of the Raptors star, who has been instrumental in driving the Toronto team to the NBA Finals. ""The span of his hands are the span of a seven foot guy and his wingspan is that of a seven-three guy.""

After practice, tasked with picking up loose basketballs, Leonard was able to palm them up with one hand as though they were tennis balls. But despite his physical gifts, Dietz said some college scouts were put off by his low-key demeanour.

What set Kawhi Leonard apart, even at an early age, Dietz says, was his work ethic. (Martin Luther King HS)

""Kawhi was not a guy who's out there pumping his chest and and getting all crazy,"" Dietz said.

Instead, Dietz said, Leonard let his game do the talking for him.

""When you put a kid on a high school basketball court that can score from all five positions, who can defend all five positions, as a coach you can kind of just need to get out of the way,"" Dietz said.

Work ethic — and lots of drive

But what made Leonard special wasn't just his versatility or his big hands, it was his drive, Dietz said.

A decade after Leonard graduated, stories of his legendary work ethic — how he would get up at 5 a.m. to practice before school, then drill after the team's daily practice — are inspiring the school's current players.

Fifteen-year-old Kenneth Clayton's brother played with Leonard. Clayton said his brother was full of stories about how hard his teammate worked at his game, a lesson the teen said transcends basketball.

""For me that's saying that from anywhere, and anyplace, anyone can get better,"" Clayton said.

As Leonard and the Raptors take on Oakland's Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, Clayton and many of the students at the school find themselves cheering for a team based in another country, against a team from their own state.

""I'm going for the Raptors,"" Clayton said. ""I don't know if they'll win, but I'm still going for them.""

The staff and students at the high school were admittedly conflicted in April during the Raptors first-round series with Milwaukee, because Tony Snell, who also starred with Leonard at King in 2009, played for the Bucks. Snell scored a playoff career high 19 points against the Raptors in Game 4, but the Bucks lost the series in six games.

Now, Dietz said, the high school is firmly behind Leonard.

""We want him to know that the second biggest fan base of the Toronto Raptors are in Riverside,"" Dietz said.

But for how much longer?

Rumours are swirling that Leonard might not opt to extend his contract with the Raptors for another year, and choose instead to enter free agency.

Two Los Angeles-based NBA teams are vying for his signature, and seem willing to go to great lengths to convince the California native to come home. The L.A. Clippers were recently fined $50,000 US for violating the league's anti-tampering rule when coach Doc Rivers compared Leonard to Michael Jordan in a TV appearance.

Jim Alexander, a Riverside-based columnist for the Southern California News Group who has covered Leonard since his high school days, said he thinks it's unlikely Leonard will be swayed by the glitz and glamour of playing in Tinseltown.

Jim Alexander, a Riverside-based columnist with the Southern California News Group, says his 'hunch' is that Leonard will stay in Toronto rather than play at the Staples Center behind him, for the L.A. Lakers or Clippers. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)

""He doesn't seem to be in it for the fame or the glory or the money, although you know he's going to get handsomely paid this summer,"" Alexander said.

Even though many Southern Californians are hoping Leonard will eventually join the pantheon of statues outside the Staples Center that immortalize L.A. basketball heroes like Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal, Alexander isn't so sure.

""I think he will stay in Toronto,"" Alexander said, though he's quick to add it's just a hunch.

""I just think given his nature, given his priorities, he seems to have enjoyed it in Toronto,"" the columnist said. ""Coming back home to Southern California, that's a powerful lure. But you get back home and then all of a sudden you have all of your friends bugging you for tickets and whatnot, so I don't know.""

Surprisingly, former King basketball player Maurice Jones said he would be fine with seeing Leonard stay in Toronto.

Jones was in Grade 8 when he saw Leonard lead the King High Wolves to one of two southern California basketball titles.

""He dunked it on somebody,"" Jones said with a laugh. ""I already knew he was going to be amazing. The moment I'd seen him play, I was like, this guy's gonna be a superstar no matter what.""

After Jones's contract with a basketball team in Argentina ended earlier this year, he returned to Riverside and is now helping out his old coach at the basketball camp. Of course he would love to see Leonard play in person in Los Angeles, Jones said. But he thinks Leonard should stay put.

""It's always nice to come home, but if you're winning titles at a place and building a new legacy over there I might as well just stay over there,"" Jones said.

Dietz points to a picture of Kawhi Leonard and Tony Snell, who now plays with the Milwaukee Bucks, saying he feels 'real lucky to be just part of it.' (Kim Brunhuber/CBC)

Whether the Raptors will actually take that title is an open question. After a big win in Oakland on Wednesday night, Toronto is leading the series 2-1 going into Game 4.

Back at the basketball camp, as the first day came to an end, the kids gathered in a circle, where Dietz led them in a cheer.

""1-2-3 Kawhi!"" they shouted in unison.

As the series continues this week, many of these children from Riverside will be watching — and cheering for — the Raptors and the team's quiet leader.

""We're jumping on that bandwagon and supporting him,"" Dietz said. ""So I hope somewhere down deep inside he feels it.""","It was the first day of June basketball camp at Martin Luther King High School in Riverside, about 90 kilometres east of Los Angeles.

1103,,Cbc News,"Officials with Canada's primary professional soccer league confirm they're investigating allegations of racist comments after a tense game on Tuesday night between Calgary's Cavalry Football Club and Hamilton's Forge Football Club ended in a tie and a shoving match.

The Canadian Premier League (CPL) issued a statement saying officials are looking into the matter.

""The league is in direct communication with both clubs to gather more information before referring the matter to Canada Soccer,"" the emailed statement said, referring to the official governing body for soccer in Canada.

""Once this is forthcoming, we will actively continue to review and support the matter through Canada Soccer's code of conduct and ethics.""

It was a last-minute penalty kick for the Calgary team that brought them to the heated 1-1 draw with Hamilton in a second-round qualifying matchup in the Canadian Championship.

Hours later, in a video post on Instagram, Calgary attacker Jordan Brown said racist comments were involved in the situation.

""Look, things happen in sport, things get heated after games, during games, etc., and it will always be 'he said, she said,' you know, who started this fight,"" he said.

Cavalry FC player Jordan Brown posted a video on Instagram Stories in which he said his teammates heard a racist remark following Tuesday's game against Hamilton's Forge FC. (Instagram)

""But at the end of the day, I don't condone racism in any shape or form,"" he said.

""A couple of my colleagues witnessed this. Luckily, I never witnessed this because, you know, I would have probably done something I regretted,"" Brown said.

Other Cavalry FC players also posted on social media about the incident but later deleted their posts.

CBC News asked officials with Forge FC for a comment, but the team did not provide one.

Cavalry FC midfielder Elijah Adekugbe's brother Sam Adekugbe, who has played for Canada's national team, also weighed in, tweeting that there is ""no place in the game for racism, especially in a multicultural society such as @CPLsoccer.""

No place in the game for racism, especially in a multicultural society such as <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPLsoccer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPLsoccer</a> —@SamAdekugbe

Calgary and Hamilton are set to play again on June 11 in the second leg of the second-round qualifying matchup.

Racism in soccer has been a longtime problem that occasionally flares up in the game, in the stands, and on the field.

In 2013, FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) established a task force against racism and discrimination.

The task force was disbanded three years later with the world governing body announcing: an anti-discrimination monitoring system at matches; the launch of a ""good practice guide""; a new team of footballing legends; and a new diversity award.",,"['forge', 'team', 'racism', 'racist', 'game', 'league', 'later', 'soccer', 'fc', 'officials']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news
1104,,Senior Investigative Journalist,"Saskatchewan's College of Physicians and Surgeons has launched a new investigation into a physician after learning he is still calling himself a doctor and looking for new clients despite being stripped of his licence last year after he admitted he had sex with patients.

Earlier this year, Josias Furstenberg donned a pink-striped hat and goofy glasses and started producing health advice videos on his YouTube channel, ""Pinky and the Doc: Couch talk with Doctor Jof."" On that site, ""Doctor Jof,"" Furstenberg's moniker, says he's providing ""medical information for everyday people.""

And on his Facebook page, he's actively looking for clients for his new ""health coach"" business.

Furstenberg came to the college's attention in early 2017 after it received a complaint from a mother who alleged Furstenberg, who was practising in Prince Albert, was having sex with her adult daughter while also prescribing her large quantities of opioids.

After an investigation, Saskatchewan's College of Physicians and Surgeons charged him with 10 counts of unprofessional conduct. It said he had sex with two of his patients and a ""romantic relationship"" with three others. It also alleged he inappropriately accessed the medical file of a patient, shared confidential information about one patient with another and overprescribed opioids to a patient.

Furstenberg pleaded guilty to all charges.

In more than 40 videos, Doctor Jof offers advice on a wide range of health-care topics, including this video entitled Come Shower with Me, about how showering can make you healthier. (YouTube)

In its written decision, the college said, ""having a sexual relationship with a patient is likely the most egregious behaviour by a physician.… The council clearly considers this sexual abuse by a physician.""

Furstenberg's YouTube page ""Pinky and the Doc: Couch talk with Doctor Jof"" features more than 40 video segments with names like ""Come Shower with me,"" in which Furstenberg appears shirtless in the shower, ""Live Longer than Wolverine,"" ""Victimize Me Please!"" and ""The Emotion of Constipation.""

For the past few weeks, Fursteberg has been posting health advice videos on his YouTube channel called Pinky and the Doc - Couch talk with Dr. Jof. (YouTube/Pinky and the Doc)

He's not just dispensing advice to the masses. He's also looking for clients.

Last week, CBC asked the college about the appropriateness of Furstenberg's recent online activity.

What you've raised is of enough concern and has enough specificity to it that we will have to look at it and make a specific decision about what exactly we're going to do. - Bryan Salte

Bryan Salte, the college's associate registrar and legal counsel, said it's a violation of the Medical Profession Act for someone who's unlicensed to pose as a doctor and dispense medical advice.

Salte said based on information CBC brought to his attention, the college has launched an investigation into Furstenberg.

""What you've raised is of enough concern and has enough specificity to it that we will have to look at it and make a specific decision about what exactly we're going to do,"" he said.

When reached by phone, Furstenberg told CBC he's done nothing wrong.

A doctor looking for clients

In a Facebook ad posted May 30, Furstenberg offered one month of life coaching and said, ""mother healed of 40,000 extra heartbeats a day and her daughter of psoriasis, without prescription meds. Daily email tips and weekly skype calls.""

On his Facebook page, Furstenberg is looking for patients interested in 'life coaching.' (Facebook/Doctor Jof)

A CBC journalist reached out to Furstenberg by email under an assumed identity, complaining of protracted stomach problems and asking for his help.

He offered to ""highly and specifically individualize the program to address your most urgent issue, which is currently the stomach trouble"" at a cost of $500.

When reached by phone, Furstenberg acknowledged he is looking for clients, but said he does not do in-person meetings.

""I do not plan on seeing people on a one-on-one basis in a physical setting. That will not happen. Physical one-on-one consultation is not being practised or coached,"" he said.

However, his exchange with the undercover reporter raises doubts about that.

The journalist asked ""do you do face-to-face meetings or what's the best way to communicate?""

Furstenberg replied ""Skype/Zoom communication works great. Saskatoon is not too far away and meeting in a public but private enough location may be an option.""

In an email exchange with an undercover reporter, Furstenberg indicated he was open to a face-to-face meeting. (CBC)

When CBC brought this email exchange to Furstenberg's attention, he acknowledged he does meet with clients face-to-face, but he said only under strict conditions.

He said before he would meet someone in person, he would ask them to sign a waiver acknowledging he's not a registered doctor and agreeing that a chaperone must be present at all meetings.

""And I will enforce it. I'm unwilling to put myself in a position where I'm alone with any client, male or female. So a chaperone of choice will need to be present definitely,"" he said.

CBC asked Furstenberg why he initially said he would never meet with a client face-to-face. He said it's rare and only if required.

College concerned about potential risk to public

Salte said while lots of people offer general advice, someone calling themself a doctor and offering specific advice is a significant concern.

""There has to be some closer connection to a particular individual saying I can help your particular condition,"" Salte said. ""So the more that you get into specific conditions the more likely it is that an individual is committing an offence by addressing the particular conditions of a particular person.""

He said it's even worse if there is a charge for the service.

Salte said that given Furstenberg's history of inappropriate behaviour it would be of concern if he was seeking patients ""because that would be something that may potentially increase the risk associated with the continued activity.""

In the college's 2018 ruling against Furstenberg, one of the reasons it offered for revoking his licence was protection of the public.

""The Ontario Task Force of 1991 points out that there is considerable risk that physicians 'who abuse one person will abuse others,' "" the college said.

Furstenberg calls himself a doctor

Though his licence has been revoked, Furstenberg doesn't shy away from calling himself a doctor.

His website, doctorjof.com, says, ""during his time in Canada he has requalified as an MD [and] is registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.""

On Furstenberg's website, he presented himself as a doctor looking for patients. Since CBC reached out to him, he has deleted the site. (www.doctorjof.com)

On his Facebook page, he says ""the following services are offered by Dr. Josias Furstenberg … anti-aging medicine, medical advice, general health care, obesity, insomnia, weight loss, mental health, autoimmune disease reversal, stem cell therapy (coming soon), gut health, brain health, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.""

In his introductory video on YouTube, he said: ""I'm an MD qualified South Africa and here in Canada. I am a qualified acupuncturist and I have a fellowship in anti-aging and regenerative integrative functional medicine.""

He doesn't mention in that video that his medical licence was revoked, but he does offer an explanation for moving away from ""conventional medicine.""

""After about 10 years in conventional medicine as a family doc, I realized I was just treating symptoms — masking symptoms with prescription drugs and medication and I wasn't really helping people get better.""

He said that is what led him to move in a more ""holistic"" direction.

Doctor Jof offers disclaimer

In his interview with CBC, Furstenberg said he has consistently made it perfectly clear that he is no longer a licensed doctor.

""Always and everywhere it will state that you should verify that [advice] with a qualified health-care practitioner,"" Furstenberg said.

Doctor Jof, Pinky and the Doc or Dr. JJ Furstenberg are not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information, services or product you obtain through this video, site or blog. - Doctor Jof's Facebook page

In scanning his online presence through social media and his website, CBC found only one instance where Furstenberg offered a written disclaimer.

In the ""About"" section of his YouTube channel, he wrote, ""Dr. Jof does not diagnose, treat or prevent medical conditions; he helps people own and create their health in order to avoid health problems or disease from developing. He also works with their physicians, who then monitor their medications. Dr. Jof does not advise the alteration of medications, without consulting a qualified, registered health practitioner.""

In his emails to CBC's undercover reporter, Furstenberg did make clear that ""I am not currently registered either as an acupuncturist or medical doctor in Saskatchewan.""

CBC pointed out to Furstenberg that in many cases, he failed to publicly disclose that he is not a registered physician.

He said ultimately it's the responsibility of others to do their own due diligence.

""The statement is available. I mean if you can't find it, then I mean that's up to everybody themselves. I'm not really prepared to say anything else but I'm not hiding the fact that I'm not registered,"" he said.

Since that interview, Furstenberg has taken down his website and added a disclaimer to his Facebook page.

""Doctor Jof, Pinky and the Doc or Dr. JJ Furstenberg are not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information, services or product you obtain through this video, site or blog,"" the newly posted disclaimer says.

Bryan Salte, the registrar with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, says his organization has launched an investigation into Furstenberg. (CBC)

CBC asked Salte if Furstenberg's disclaimers reduce the college's concerns.

Salte said a previous court decision in a similar case asked, ""what is the impression that is left by the individual who may be interacting with someone who may be engaged in an illegal practice of medicine?""

In other words, what would an average, unsophisticated patient think after looking at his online presentation?

""The fact that perhaps by very careful scrutiny and looking through a whole lot of documents you can identify that an individual is actually not licensed doesn't necessarily mean that they are not committing an offence,"" said Salte.

Salte said if someone is found to have been practising medicine without a licence, he would face a maximum penalty of $5,000.",,"['college', 'doctor', 'jof', 'looking', 'cbc', 'health', 'medical', 'furstenberg', 'advice', 'video']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news

Salte said based on information CBC brought to his attention, the college has launched an investigation into Furstenberg.

""What you've raised is of enough concern and has enough specificity to it that we will have to look at it and make a specific decision about what exactly we're going to do,"" he said.

When reached by phone, Furstenberg told CBC he's done nothing wrong.

A doctor looking for clients

In a Facebook ad posted May 30, Furstenberg offered one month of life coaching and said, ""mother healed of 40,000 extra heartbeats a day and her daughter of psoriasis, without prescription meds. Daily email tips and weekly skype calls.""

A CBC journalist reached out to Furstenberg by email under an assumed identity, complaining of protracted stomach problems and asking for his help.

He offered to ""highly and specifically individualize the program to address your most urgent issue, which is currently the stomach trouble"" at a cost of $500.

When reached by phone, Furstenberg acknowledged he is looking for clients, but said he does not do in-person meetings.

""I do not plan on seeing people on a one-on-one basis in a physical setting. That will not happen. Physical one-on-one consultation is not being practised or coached,"" he said.

However, his exchange with the undercover reporter raises doubts about that.

The journalist asked ""do you do face-to-face meetings or what's the best way to communicate?""

Furstenberg replied ""Skype/Zoom communication works great. Saskatoon is not too far away and meeting in a public but private enough location may be an option.""

In an email exchange with an undercover reporter, Furstenberg indicated he was open to a face-to-face meeting. (CBC)

When CBC brought this email exchange to Furstenberg's attention, he acknowledged he does meet with clients face-to-face, but he said only under strict conditions.

He said before he would meet someone in person, he would ask them to sign a waiver acknowledging he's not a registered doctor and agreeing that a chaperone must be present at all meetings.

""And I will enforce it. I'm unwilling to put myself in a position where I'm alone with any client, male or female. So a chaperone of choice will need to be present definitely,"" he said.

CBC asked Furstenberg why he initially said he would never meet with a client face-to-face. He said it's rare and only if required.

College concerned about potential risk to public

Salte said while lots of people offer general advice, someone calling themself a doctor and offering specific advice is a significant concern.

""There has to be some closer connection to a particular individual saying I can help your particular condition,"" Salte said. ""So the more that you get into specific conditions the more likely it is that an individual is committing an offence by addressing the particular conditions of a particular person.""

He said it's even worse if there is a charge for the service.

Salte said that given Furstenberg's history of inappropriate behaviour it would be of concern if he was seeking patients ""because that would be something that may potentially increase the risk associated with the continued activity.""

In the college's 2018 ruling against Furstenberg, one of the reasons it offered for revoking his licence was protection of the public.

""The Ontario Task Force of 1991 points out that there is considerable risk that physicians 'who abuse one person will abuse others,' "" the college said.

Furstenberg calls himself a doctor

Though his licence has been revoked, Furstenberg doesn't shy away from calling himself a doctor.

His website, doctorjof.com, says, ""during his time in Canada he has requalified as an MD [and] is registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.""

On Furstenberg's website, he presented himself as a doctor looking for patients. Since CBC reached out to him, he has deleted the site. (www.doctorjof.com)

On his Facebook page, he says ""the following services are offered by Dr. Josias Furstenberg … anti-aging medicine, medical advice, general health care, obesity, insomnia, weight loss, mental health, autoimmune disease reversal, stem cell therapy (coming soon), gut health, brain health, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.""

In his introductory video on YouTube, he said: ""I'm an MD qualified South Africa and here in Canada. I am a qualified acupuncturist and I have a fellowship in anti-aging and regenerative integrative functional medicine.""

He doesn't mention in that video that his medical licence was revoked, but he does offer an explanation for moving away from ""conventional medicine.""

""After about 10 years in conventional medicine as a family doc, I realized I was just treating symptoms — masking symptoms with prescription drugs and medication and I wasn't really helping people get better.""

He said that is what led him to move in a more ""holistic"" direction.

Doctor Jof offers disclaimer

In his interview with CBC, Furstenberg said he has consistently made it perfectly clear that he is no longer a licensed doctor.

""Always and everywhere it will state that you should verify that [advice] with a qualified health-care practitioner,"" Furstenberg said.

Doctor Jof, Pinky and the Doc or Dr. JJ Furstenberg are not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information, services or product you obtain through this video, site or blog. - Doctor Jof's Facebook page

In scanning his online presence through social media and his website, CBC found only one instance where Furstenberg offered a written disclaimer.

In the ""About"" section of his YouTube channel, he wrote, ""Dr. Jof does not diagnose, treat or prevent medical conditions; he helps people own and create their health in order to avoid health problems or disease from developing. He also works with their physicians, who then monitor their medications. Dr. Jof does not advise the alteration of medications, without consulting a qualified, registered health practitioner.""

In his emails to CBC's undercover reporter, Furstenberg did make clear that ""I am not currently registered either as an acupuncturist or medical doctor in Saskatchewan.""

CBC pointed out to Furstenberg that in many cases, he failed to publicly disclose that he is not a registered physician.

He said ultimately it's the responsibility of others to do their own due diligence.

""The statement is available. I mean if you can't find it, then I mean that's up to everybody themselves. I'm not really prepared to say anything else but I'm not hiding the fact that I'm not registered,"" he said.

Since that interview, Furstenberg has taken down his website and added a disclaimer to his Facebook page.

""Doctor Jof, Pinky and the Doc or Dr. JJ Furstenberg are not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information, services or product you obtain through this video, site or blog,"" the newly posted disclaimer says.

Bryan Salte, the registrar with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, says his organization has launched an investigation into Furstenberg. (CBC)

CBC asked Salte if Furstenberg's disclaimers reduce the college's concerns.

Salte said a previous court decision in a similar case asked, ""what is the impression that is left by the individual who may be interacting with someone who may be engaged in an illegal practice of medicine?""

In other words, what would an average, unsophisticated patient think after looking at his online presentation?

""The fact that perhaps by very careful scrutiny and looking through a whole lot of documents you can identify that an individual is actually not licensed doesn't necessarily mean that they are not committing an offence,"" said Salte.

Salte said if someone is found to have been practising medicine without a licence, he would face a maximum penalty of $5,000.",,"['college', 'doctor', 'jof', 'looking', 'cbc', 'health', 'medical', 'furstenberg', 'advice', 'video']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news
1107,,Regional Awards.,"Saskatchewan's College of Physicians and Surgeons has launched a new investigation into a physician after learning he is still calling himself a doctor and looking for new clients despite being stripped of his licence last year after he admitted he had sex with patients.

Earlier this year, Josias Furstenberg donned a pink-striped hat and goofy glasses and started producing health advice videos on his YouTube channel, ""Pinky and the Doc: Couch talk with Doctor Jof."" On that site, ""Doctor Jof,"" Furstenberg's moniker, says he's providing ""medical information for everyday people.""

And on his Facebook page, he's actively looking for clients for his new ""health coach"" business.

Furstenberg came to the college's attention in early 2017 after it received a complaint from a mother who alleged Furstenberg, who was practising in Prince Albert, was having sex with her adult daughter while also prescribing her large quantities of opioids.

After an investigation, Saskatchewan's College of Physicians and Surgeons charged him with 10 counts of unprofessional conduct. It said he had sex with two of his patients and a ""romantic relationship"" with three others. It also alleged he inappropriately accessed the medical file of a patient, shared confidential information about one patient with another and overprescribed opioids to a patient.

Furstenberg pleaded guilty to all charges.

In more than 40 videos, Doctor Jof offers advice on a wide range of health-care topics, including this video entitled Come Shower with Me, about how showering can make you healthier. (YouTube)

In its written decision, the college said, ""having a sexual relationship with a patient is likely the most egregious behaviour by a physician.… The council clearly considers this sexual abuse by a physician.""

Furstenberg's YouTube page ""Pinky and the Doc: Couch talk with Doctor Jof"" features more than 40 video segments with names like ""Come Shower with me,"" in which Furstenberg appears shirtless in the shower, ""Live Longer than Wolverine,"" ""Victimize Me Please!"" and ""The Emotion of Constipation.""

For the past few weeks, Fursteberg has been posting health advice videos on his YouTube channel called Pinky and the Doc - Couch talk with Dr. Jof. (YouTube/Pinky and the Doc)

He's not just dispensing advice to the masses. He's also looking for clients.

Last week, CBC asked the college about the appropriateness of Furstenberg's recent online activity.

""So the more that you get into specific conditions the more likely it is that an individual is committing an offence by addressing the particular conditions of a particular person.""

He said it's even worse if there is a charge for the service.

Salte said that given Furstenberg's history of inappropriate behaviour it would be of concern if he was seeking patients ""because that would be something that may potentially increase the risk associated with the continued activity.""

In the college's 2018 ruling against Furstenberg, one of the reasons it offered for revoking his licence was protection of the public.

""The Ontario Task Force of 1991 points out that there is considerable risk that physicians 'who abuse one person will abuse others,' "" the college said.

Furstenberg calls himself a doctor

Though his licence has been revoked, Furstenberg doesn't shy away from calling himself a doctor.

His website, doctorjof.com, says, ""during his time in Canada he has requalified as an MD [and] is registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.""

On Furstenberg's website, he presented himself as a doctor looking for patients. Since CBC reached out to him, he has deleted the site. (www.doctorjof.com)

On his Facebook page, he says ""the following services are offered by Dr. Josias Furstenberg … anti-aging medicine, medical advice, general health care, obesity, insomnia, weight loss, mental health, autoimmune disease reversal, stem cell therapy (coming soon), gut health, brain health, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.""

In his introductory video on YouTube, he said: ""I'm an MD qualified South Africa and here in Canada. I am a qualified acupuncturist and I have a fellowship in anti-aging and regenerative integrative functional medicine.""

He doesn't mention in that video that his medical licence was revoked, but he does offer an explanation for moving away from ""conventional medicine.""

""After about 10 years in conventional medicine as a family doc, I realized I was just treating symptoms — masking symptoms with prescription drugs and medication and I wasn't really helping people get better.""

He said that is what led him to move in a more ""holistic"" direction.

Doctor Jof offers disclaimer

In his interview with CBC, Furstenberg said he has consistently made it perfectly clear that he is no longer a licensed doctor.

""Always and everywhere it will state that you should verify that [advice] with a qualified health-care practitioner,"" Furstenberg said.

Doctor Jof, Pinky and the Doc or Dr. JJ Furstenberg are not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information, services or product you obtain through this video, site or blog. - Doctor Jof's Facebook page

In scanning his online presence through social media and his website, CBC found only one instance where Furstenberg offered a written disclaimer.

In the ""About"" section of his YouTube channel, he wrote, ""Dr. Jof does not diagnose, treat or prevent medical conditions; he helps people own and create their health in order to avoid health problems or disease from developing. He also works with their physicians, who then monitor their medications. Dr. Jof does not advise the alteration of medications, without consulting a qualified, registered health practitioner.""

In his emails to CBC's undercover reporter, Furstenberg did make clear that ""I am not currently registered either as an acupuncturist or medical doctor in Saskatchewan.""

CBC pointed out to Furstenberg that in many cases, he failed to publicly disclose that he is not a registered physician.

He said ultimately it's the responsibility of others to do their own due diligence.

""The statement is available. I mean if you can't find it, then I mean that's up to everybody themselves. I'm not really prepared to say anything else but I'm not hiding the fact that I'm not registered,"" he said.

Since that interview, Furstenberg has taken down his website and added a disclaimer to his Facebook page.

""Doctor Jof, Pinky and the Doc or Dr. JJ Furstenberg are not liable or responsible for any advice, course of treatment, diagnosis or any other information, services or product you obtain through this video, site or blog,"" the newly posted disclaimer says.

Bryan Salte, the registrar with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, says his organization has launched an investigation into Furstenberg. (CBC)

CBC asked Salte if Furstenberg's disclaimers reduce the college's concerns.

Salte said a previous court decision in a similar case asked, ""what is the impression that is left by the individual who may be interacting with someone who may be engaged in an illegal practice of medicine?""

In other words, what would an average, unsophisticated patient think after looking at his online presentation?

""The fact that perhaps by very careful scrutiny and looking through a whole lot of documents you can identify that an individual is actually not licensed doesn't necessarily mean that they are not committing an offence,"" said Salte.

Salte said if someone is found to have been practising medicine without a licence, he would face a maximum penalty of $5,000.",,"['college', 'doctor', 'jof', 'looking', 'cbc', 'health', 'medical', 'furstenberg', 'advice', 'video']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news
1110,,Thomson Reuters,"About 115 million boys were married off as children, with one in five wed before they turned 15, according to the first United Nations study to track the prevalence of child grooms.

The UN children's agency, UNICEF, analyzed marriage and population data across 82 countries and found the Central African Republic had the highest prevalence of child grooms married before the age of 18, at 28 per cent, followed by Nicaragua at 19 per cent and Madagascar with 13 per cent.

UNICEF said children who married young tended to leave school, have limited economic opportunities, and be more vulnerable to abuse and mental health problems than those who married later.

""Marriage steals childhood,"" the charity's executive director, Henrietta Fore, said in a statement as the report was released on Friday.

""Child grooms are forced to take on adult responsibilities for which they may not be ready. Early marriage brings early fatherhood, and with it added pressure to provide for a family, cutting short education and job opportunities.""

UNICEF said these figures mean there are now 765 million married boys and girls among the 2.2 billion children globally. However, girls are still more likely to wed young, which puts them at risk of health issues related to teen pregnancy.

Globally, about one in every five women aged 20 to 24 were married before their 18th birthday, compared to one in 30 men, UNICEF said.

If all girls finished secondary school, more than 50 million child marriages could be prevented by 2030, children's charity Save the Children said in an October report.

The United Nations has said all countries should end child marriage by 2030 as agreed in the global development goals in 2015.

Almost all countries have a minimum marriage age of 18, but children can still legally wed in places like the United States if they have parental consent or through religious ceremonies, according to data research group WORLD Policy Analysis Center.",,"['marriage', 'million', 'girls', 'children', 'married', 'unicef', 'child', 'united', 'countries', 'young']",,https://www.cbc.ca/news

1118,logo,Cbc Television,"When creating a fictional show, a writer typically draws from personal experience for inspiration to craft storylines. But what if your show is about a cranky aging demon hunter looking to retire from killing monsters?

Series creator Mark Little turned to improvisational comedy and pop culture while creating Gary and His Demons (GAHD). Mark voices the main character Gary, an aging, reluctant demon hunter who saves the day with help from his optimistic partner Hanley.

The series gives little nods to late 80's and 90's shows throughout the first season. After GAHD was nominated for a Canadian Screen Award, we emailed Mark to ask about what shows inspired him while creating the series.

Gary's transformation song

Remember the transformation sequences from Sailor Moon? Each ""sailor"" would power-up in a dream-like setting, their costume changing while inspirational music played, and ending with the character striking a power pose before kicking some ass.

The same thing happens when Gary's about to hunt some demons — except he sings while it's happening.

🎵 Through the distant night/ I become myself/ But a better version/ Of myself/ I'm the best! 🎵 - Gary's transformation song

In episode 14, Gary travels to Japan for a conference of rookie demon hunters. Together, they build a robot with their weapons in a sequence reminiscent of the Megazord transformation scenes from Power Rangers.

Grundleman

Candyman, Candyman, Candyman… According to the urban legend from the 1992 horror movie Candyman, saying that name five times in a mirror will summon a hook wielding murderer.

GAHD has its own mirror monster in episode 2, but he goes by a much less cooler name — Grundleman. He's got hooks for hands and his awful puns are worse than his stabs. A group of teenagers summon Grundleman at a slumber party by saying his name 25 times in a mirror. He murders most of them.

Gary comes up with a plan to stop Grundleman by summoning Bloody Mary, an old school mirror demon with some history with Gary.

Fleshler '99

Episode 4 - Fleshler '99 begins with Gary reminiscing about the year 1999: swing dancing was in style, cyberpunk movies were all the rage and his girlfriend Janine was still alive. In a flashback, Gary and Janine leave the theatre after seeing ""Code R"" — a half-assed Matrix ripoff.

The Matrix wasn't the only late 90's movie that inspired the episode — the 1998 vampire killer Blade also gets a nod during the nightclub scene. ""The party scene was supposed to be like the Blade blood rave except with bits of flesh sprinkling down instead of blood, but we lost that for some reason,"" writes Mark.

In a dance scene inspired by the mid-90's movie Swingers, Janine and Gary run into some demons while swing dancing at a club. This is one of the few times in the series that we get a glimpse of Gary in his demon-hunting prime — he gleefully kills monsters while this song plays in the background:

End credits

In the series finale, the end credits song parodies Neon Genesis Evangelion. The anime's end credits fade in to dulcet variations of the classic song ""Fly Me to the Moon.""

In the end credits for the final episode of GAHD, you can hear Mark Little wailing the lyrics (most likely improvised) in the same style as his magical sword rotates in the foreground.

🎵 Any time you're feelin'/ Afraid of demons/ Gary will be there/ To save the day! 🎵 - Gary's end credits song

Improvised dialogue

In behind the scenes footage of the animated series, Mark Little reveals that GAHD's dialogue was a mix of scripting and improvisation. The stand-up comedian has been a student of improv since high school when he performed with the Canadian Improv Games organization.

""Every show I do, I try to play with pace of dialogue, overlapping it as much as possible and burying punchlines a bit,"" writes Mark. ""I learned a lot about it from watching Armando Iannucci's shows.""

His off-the-cuff style bleeds into work in his other projects such as Cavendish and his role as Simon Hunt in Mr. D.

""The source of my love for this style of dialogue probably comes from early Spielberg (Jaws, ET, Poltergeist,Goonies), plus Fred Dekker and Shane Black. Monster Squad was my favourite movie as a kid and the writing in it is so fast, so energetic, with so much overlap, it's wild.""","Series creator Mark Little turned to improvisational comedy and pop culture while creating Gary and His Demons (GAHD).

It sounds like a delightful trip.

Two Scottish brothers hop in a car and set off on a 3,000 kilometre sightseeing journey around the United Kingdom.

But this was no typical tour. The sights Andy and Magnus Tait longed to see weren't Big Ben or Stonehenge.

The Tait brothers had something else in mind: a journey to see all the rudest place names Britain has to offer — and, it turns out, there are quite a few.

Andy Tait is now back home in Aberdeen, Scotland. He spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about his autumn expedition.

Here is part of their conversation.

Andy, what inspired this rude road trip that you took with your brother?

It was 2013 when I first had the idea. Basically, me and my brother used to work together. We were travelling for work in the north east of Scotland and we passed by a sign pointing at a town called Gash.

I don't know if that's a funny word in Canada. But it certainly is in the U.K.

We came back a couple of weeks later and we took a selfie there and it was very funny. It got me thinking — are there any other places in the U.K. we could go and take selfies at?

I kept a Word document over the years [and] every time I'd hear about a funny-named place in the paper or online or whatever I'd just add it to the list.

(Submitted by Andy Tait)

What are some of the other places you visited?

Wilsford Cum Lake, which I believe is an area between the areas of Wilsford and Lake. So, it's Wilsford Cum Lake, which I just thought was hilarious.

Also, there's Titty Ho. I don't know where that gets its name, but I'd like to find out.

Also, Lickfold. That was a nice place as well, very picturesque around there.

And Pound Bottom. Again, very, very lovely area and it's quite funny.

(Submitted by Andy Tait)

Any scenery? Was it basically just the names and the selfie — or did you take in any of the sights?

Around the New Forest, which is in South England, that had two of our places — Sandyballs and Pound Bottom — it was really, really picturesque. It's a national park.

They have lovely, lovely countryside and even better — wild ponies. We actually had to stop on the road several times because some wild ponies had just wandered onto the road. It was quite, quite bizarre.

What are some of the other places you visited?

We started in the northwest of England with places like Cockermouth and Slackbottom Road in Bradford, Penistone in Yorkshire, Butthole Lane — things like that.

Then we sort of went down to the south west of England. We didn't go all the way into the southwest where there's a few good ones that we missed out like Crapstone.

After that we went to places like Shitterton, Cocking, South Harting — which is abbreviated as S. Harting on the sign.

And yeah, worked our way up the east coast to places like Fingringhoe, Feltwell, Rimswell, Fanny Hands Lane — places like that. Wetwang, which is another good one. The final place name we did was Coxhoe.

(Submitted by Andy Tait)

When you visited these places did you tell anybody what you were doing?

We didn't really have time to stop and chat to anyone. It was very much a kind of mission.

I'm now getting emails from people who live near these places. And some of them, it never even occurred to them the name was funny. I thought that was quite hilarious.

They're going, ""Ha! Lived there my whole life and I didn't realize that such and such a place was funny.""

How is it possible if, say, you lived on Butthole Lane, you wouldn't know that someone might find that kind of amusing?

Ha! Exactly, exactly.

(Submitted by Andy Tait)

You and your brother are in your thirties right?

Yeah, that's right. I'm 34. He's 32.

So how come you didn't get this out of your system when you were in primary school?

I've always had a very childish sense of humour.

I love expending great effort to do something totally pointless ... So I think this kind of counts as being a very, very pointless exercise that took a lot of effort. I love that kind of thing.

So there's an 11-year-old buried not so deep inside you and your brother?

Very much so.

(Submitted by Andy Tait)

How long did this trip take you?

It took us four entire days.

It was quite a gruelling journey. There was at least sort of 16 hours a day traveling. It was nearly 2,000 miles [3,200 kilometres] as well.

I have to admit that at this show, As It Happens, there is an 11-year-old at the heart of our program as well. And so they have decided to put together the list that we think you should visit in Canada. Do you want to hear it?

Oh, I'd love to hear it.

Balls Falls, in Ontario. Crotch Lake, also in Ontario.

Great.

You'd have to make your way to Climax, Saskatchewan.

Climax. I love it.

Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia.

Oh, amazing.

And endless places in Newfoundland, but we'll give you a couple. Spread Eagle Bay and the perennial Canadian favourite — Dildo, Newfoundland.

Dildo! Amazing, I love it.

This weekend, he returns to his hometown of Toronto to serve as master of ceremonies at the Laughter is the Best Medicine Gala, in support of the Michael Garron Hospital Foundation.

Arnett's father is a huge supporter of the hospital and over the last few years the gala has attracted some of the biggest names in comedy to help raise money, including Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld and Jim Gaffigan. This year, Michelle Wolf will take the stage.

1134,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"Karen Jenner scans a rocky Nova Scotia beach, looking for dots of colour amidst the rocks and seaweed — signs of plastic garbage deposited by the Bay of Fundy's massive tides.

""Today you could be here for a long time, because there's a lot of trash on the beach.""

Two to three times a week, Jenner hits the beaches on the Bay of Fundy to pick up trash, filling five-gallon buckets with everything from fishing garbage, such as rope and lobster bands, to household items, including bottle caps, plastic cutlery and plastic bottles.

In a year of collecting, she's taken home more than 2,200 kilograms worth of trash.

""It's a drip in the bucket,"" she said. ""There could be 100 of me out doing this, and yet the trash would still be coming in. There's just so much in the water.""

An assortment of items collected by Karen Jenner on the beaches of the Bay of Fundy. (Submitted by Karen Jenner)

'I decided I'm going to collect as much as I can'

But Jenner says she wasn't always so motivated to collect trash.

Though she grew up going to the beach, garbage on the shore never captured her attention.

""I didn't even really see it I guess, like a lot of people wouldn't.""

When she did notice trash, such as the packing straps from the boxes of frozen bait used by fishermen, she says she would break them apart so that they weren't in a loop and then toss them back on the beach.

""It never even dawned on me that maybe you should pick them up and bring them home.""

Jenner carries packing straps from boxes of frozen fishing bait. Jenner says she used to break the straps so they weren't in loops and then toss them back on the beach, 'and now I can't even dream of doing that.' (Moira Donovan/CBC)

But roughly a year ago, Jenner says she suddenly found herself looking at the beach differently.

""I don't know how it happened or why,"" she said. ""Seeing the amount of plastic on the beach for some reason, it just struck a chord with me, and I decided I'm going to collect as much as I can for as long as I can.""

'We have a plastic problem here'

As she moves down the shore, Jenner stops every few paces to cast a practised eye over what she finds. While most of what she collects is the ""same old garbage,"" she finds pleasure in making new discoveries, like a commemorative plastic bag that is over 40 years old.

""It's neat when you find something different.""

When Jenner is done collecting, she loads the trash in the trunk of her car and takes it home to sort and weigh or count the items.

Once Jenner has finished collecting, she takes the trash to the coverall attached to her barn to be sorted. (Moira Donovan/CBC)

Once they're sorted, Jenner photographs the collection and posts the photos on her Facebook page.

Cataloguing the items is important, she said, because it helps people be more aware of the scale of the issue.

""If people aren't aware of a problem, it's hard for them to relate to it. When people think about plastic and problems with plastic, we tend to think about places other than Nova Scotia, but we have a plastic problem here.""

Black Rock Beach, on the Bay of Fundy, is one of the beaches Karen Jenner regularly visits to collect garbage. (Moira Donovan/CBC)

Sometimes, the immensity of the problem is hard to handle, even for Jenner.

This past winter, on a trip to the beach at Hall's Harbour, she found herself overwhelmed by what she found.

""The tide was coming in, and it was full of tiny pieces of Styrofoam and rope,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it — that in Nova Scotia — I was seeing what I was seeing. I was so discouraged, and I thought, 'Why am I wasting my time doing what I'm doing?'""

But she says she's been able to overcome those moments by focusing on how her cleanups are removing hazards for local birds and marine life, and how her example can inspire other people to stage cleanups of their own.

Jenner holds some of the needles she's collected from the beach. Weighing and numbering what she finds makes the problem more real for people, Jenner says. (Moira Donovan/CBC)

""What's been neat about it is that other people are going to the beach now and picking things up, and that's nice to see.""

""You don't need to go and come back with 100 pounds, or 100 things. All you need to do is, if you see something where it shouldn't be, pick it up, and anybody can do that.""","An assortment of items collected by Karen Jenner on the beaches of the Bay of Fundy.

1135,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"A Hong Kong billionaire, an investment manager, and a money managing supercomputer called K1 — what could go wrong?

K1 was designed to comb through online sources to make stock market predictions and execute trades, adjusting its strategy over time based on machine-learning.

But after a billionaire tycoon entrusted a large amount of money to the artificial intelligence system, he faced some very real losses — including $20 million in a single day.

The billionaire is now suing the salesman who persuaded him to entrust his fortune to a robot. The lawsuit — one of the first over AI triggered stock market losses — raises many questions about the legal implications of AI.

Lifshitz spoke to Spark host Nora Young about how some of those legal issues might apply here in Canada.

When a computer or an AI powered system is making the decisions, who's ultimately responsible if things go wrong?

Well, that's the challenge of dealing with new technologies and AI because there's a bit of an alphabet soup of who's responsible. In many instances it could be a number of parties. It could be the manufacturers of the devices and of the systems. It could be the entity that's purchasing the system if they didn't do their due diligence. It could be a number of other organizations and entities. So that's the interesting part — who is responsible.

When it comes to using some of these AI systems, how do we assign liability?

It's a complex question because it really depends on where you position yourself. Are you the manufacturer of the AI device or product? Are you the distributor? Are you the original programmer? What about the end user or the consumer? So what liabilities or obligations do they have to vet the products that they're using?

There could be issues relating to bias. There could be issues relating to making sure that they did their due diligence. There could be claims relating to flaws built in the algorithms themselves, or there could be claims relating to, in Canada, negligent design or manufacture failure to warn, product liability claims, warranties if they made warranties in their contract. There could be fraud, potentially even false or misleading representations or deceptive marketing under the Competition Act. So there's a whole laundry list of different legislation that may apply.

As we look toward a world where we're seeing more and more of these artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, do you think that Canadian law can adequately deal with these types of questions, or do we need more specific legislation?

There's two schools of thought with respect to how we treat new technologies. Traditionally in Canada we've tended to be more technology neutral. We tend to look at things more broadly, we try to create principles that would apply to varying technologies. We're less channel specific, we're less focused on trying to create a specific law that deals with one aspect.

There's a lot to be said for that approach because that approach allows evolution and, to be frank, by the time most law hits the books it's already out of date in terms of the technology that it's trying to address. Other countries have a different approach and sometimes what they try to do is create very specific laws dealing with very specific types of technology and that has been more the American approach, for example, rather than the broad reason principle approach that we have. The reality is that in Canada it is early days and there is a little bit of a struggle in trying to apply current existing laws to some of these new technologies.

1136,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"The two times Harry Read has leapt out of a plane over the fields of Normandy in France couldn't be more different.

The first time, he was 20 years old, parachuting out of a transport aircraft under cover of dark as a part of the British 6th Airborne Division in the early hours of June 6, 1944.

The second time — three quarters of a century later during the 75th anniversary of D-Day — he performed a tandem skydiving jump with a member of the British Army's Parachute Display Team for ""sheer pleasure.""

""It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. I really have to express it in the most most warm words. It was a delight,"" Read, 95, told As It Happens host Carol Off on Thursday, the day after his dramatic leap.

Read was one of several Second World War veterans in their 90s who made the jump as part of the commemoration of the Normandy landings, the beginning of the Allied liberation of Nazi-occupied France.

Dressed in red jumpsuits, 95-year-old Harry Read and 94-year-old John (Jock) Hutton performed tandem jumps with the British Army's Parachute Display to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, France. 3:32

""Comparing the two is not a very good comparison, because 75 years ago we were going into action,"" Read said.

Back then, Read was among more than 8,000 soldiers tasked with protecting the Allied left flank from counter-attack as the biggest seaborne invasion in history landed ashore in northern France.

It was a crucial battle that paved the way for the eventual Allied victory — and Read knew going in that his odds of surviving were slim at best.

""We were in a war against a world that was increasingly evil,"" he said. ""Our very future was at stake. The war had to be fought. It was a sheer necessity for us to do so.""

Read comes into land as he joins parachutists, in full Allied uniforms, in a parachute drop onto fields at Sannerville on June 5 at Sannerville, France. (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)

When he jumped that first time — in the dead of night with a toolbox-sized battery strapped to his leg — Read landed ""on time, but in the wrong place.""

""The Germans, in their military wisdom, had flooded a massive area diverting a river into land that was already subject to normal overflows,"" he said.

That's where Read — and many of his brothers in arms — landed. Many men drowned in those flooded fields.

""I landed, took the battery off my leg and put my gun together and looked around to see who was ready to kill me — and lo and behold, no one was there to do that,"" Read said.

""But getting out of the flooded area was not easy and took, in effect, 16 hours.""

The lucky few

He and a fellow paratrooper were able to make it to a nearby farmhouse, where a French family was housing several other members of the Allied forces.

A local priest, who was part of the resistance, helped them connect with more of their fellow soldiers on the other side of the village.

""Because of the priest's success as a go-between, we were able to get together as a group and then make our way through the enemy lines to get to where we were supposed to be,"" he said.

Read comes in for a landing after an 'absolutely brilliant' jump. (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)

Not everyone was so lucky. More than 10,000 members of the Allied forces are estimated to have died on D-Day, as well as thousands of Germans.

That's why returning to Normandy and commemorating their sacrifice is so important to Read.

""We're proud of the record we have of pulling a victory out of an almost impossible situation. It is a great history, though brief, that regiments like ours have,"" he said.

""But we lost a lot of friends and I tend to be very emotional here. I stand in the cemetery and find that I can hardly speak — and I weep.""

But there is one thing that Read's two jumps have in common. In both cases, Read says, he's lucky to have made it.

""Anyone, I would think, over the age of 65 who would contemplate a skydive ... has got to be thinking unwisely,"" he said with a chuckle.

""Which shows one or two things [about me], doesn't it?""

1139,,Cbc News,"A treasure hunt that sent Calgarians scurrying around the city in search of a reported $100,000 prize has come to an end.

The treasure, hidden by a company called Gold Hunt, was found by Edmontonian Jeff Lerue, who has been off work due to a disability for two years, waiting for a knee replacement

""This couldn't have come at a better time for me,"" said Lerue in a news release. ""I was just denied AISH.""

The company behind the hunt buried gold and silver pieces it valued at $100,000 and charged would-be treasure hunters $25 for a map with clues or $45 for a package that included five additional clues.

""It still doesn't feel real,"" Lerue said during a news conference on Wednesday.

Edmonton hunt over quickly

Lerue said after he heard Edmonton's treasure was found within 20 hours of the start of the contest on Saturday, he decided to buy a map for Calgary's hunt.

He doesn't know Calgary that well, so on Monday, he and his girlfriend spent hours puzzling through the clues and poring over Google Maps.

Then on Tuesday, once they had an idea of where to start, they drove down to Calgary.

""We scoured until pretty much dark last night,"" he said.

""Some of the clues kind of jumped out at us.""

Lerue noticed a ton of people searching in one neighbourhood, but there was one secluded area they were passing by.

""So I thought, it's just odd that people aren't going there … and sure enough that's where it was.""

The Calgary location where the Gold Hunt treasure was found will stay secret until the Vancouver hunt has been completed. (CBC)

Lerue has promised not to reveal where he found the prize until Vancouver's hunt wraps up, as to not give any hints as to how the clues work, but he said when he found the prize in its hiding spot he was over the moon.

""I freaked out … I dropped the box and was like, 'oh my god,'"" he said, adding that the box contained instructions to claim the prize.

""I was like, let's go, let's go. We beelined to our truck and just took off.""

Lerue said he plans to use the money to pay bills and debt he's accrued while being off work, and take his girlfriend on a much-deserved vacation.

Some hiccups in inaugural treasure hunt

Chris Cromwell, Gold Hunt's spokesperson, said the inaugural scavenger hunts were a big learning experience — and that the company hopes to roll it out nationwide.

""This is our first run,"" he said.

""We've done our best to host a safe, fun, exciting and romantic treasure hunt.""

There were some hiccups, with members of the hunt disregarding the game's rules by digging up flower beds and rifling through private property.

""Obviously, it's not our intention to create anything that's going to damage public or private property,"" Cromwell said.

""We've done our best, I think, to make sure people are doing the right thing.""

While the treasure has been found, one thing will stay secret for now — the identity of the Gold Hunt team.

Cromwell said the group of friends, who are entrepreneurs and private investors, came up with the idea of the hunt just 60 days ago, and that they intend to stay anonymous for now.",,"['lerue', 'clues', 'company', 'private', 'gold', 'prize', 'stay', 'treasure', 'work', 'hunt']",,https://www.cbc.ca

Sitting in a hospital in Nova Scotia, Ferne Selig said she was ready to die.

""I've had a good life, and I mean this very sincerely, I could go, I could go anytime,"" she told David Maginley, a chaplain at a hospital in Halifax.

""After our last conversation, I'm quite looking forward to it, to be honest with you,"" Selig said.

Selig had been living with cancer for 14 months. In her working life, the 65-year-old had been a master Mary Kay beauty consultant, who earned the enviable pink Cadillac for her sales.

Maginley had been talking with her for some time, in his role at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax. The Current accompanied him on his visit with Selig.

Selig's only experience of dying was with her mother, who died of cancer in 2015. Now she found herself in the same position, as she felt her own death drawing near.

""I was so sure she was coming last night, David. I'd have bet my house that my mother was gonna take me last night,"" she said.

As she spoke, Selig became overwhelmed with emotion, and Maginley helped her to understand what she was feeling.

He told her the emotion was the ""awareness of death: it's grief, it's anticipation, and it took over your body, your breath.""

""You were washed by it, submerged in it. And all we want to do is not suppress it, we want to breathe into it, and discover that we're actually floating, not drowning.""

Maginley talks with a patient in Halifax. This patient did not receive a terminal diagnosis, but Maginley has counselled hundreds who have. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)

As Selig began to feel better, they joked together that this was ""a good rehearsal.""

""This is what makes dying so overwhelming,"" Maginley said. ""We prepare to say goodbye to you. It's heartbreaking.

""But you prepare to say goodbye to reality. And every love you've ever known. The scale of that is too much.""

Unfortunately, he said, ""to do that well involves this surrender, and giving yourself to the experience.""

Selig died shortly after the visit in April.

Speaking to The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti this week, Maginley said that emotions like Selig's are common in a person's final days.

""Our mind is trying to cope, but our body tells us the truth about our emotions,"" he said.

Part of dying well is understanding what happens to your own ego, David Maginley tells Anna Maria Tremonti. 1:02

The unfinished love stories

Maginley has been supporting cancer patients for almost 20 years.

A four-time cancer survivor himself, he published his book Beyond Surviving: Cancer and Your Spiritual Journey in 2017.

He said that what people fear most is ""not the dying, it's the leaving.""

""It's leaving your loved ones, the not being part of their stories,"" he told Tremonti.

Culturally we have a massive aversion to death, seeing it as a failure that must be prevented at all costs, he said.

""It becomes something we strive against with every aspect of our being, subconsciously. But it's inevitable homework for everyone.""

It's the words we did not say … affirming love, or the words we did that just pushed love away. - David Maginley

That homework is about forgiving the past and having a sense of humour about your own failings and shortfalls.

He told Tremonti about a woman named Liz, who had been sexually abused by her father a child. When she pressed charges as an adult, he was jailed.

Years later, after Liz received a terminal diagnosis, her father turned up at her door.

Liz told Maginley that her father ""came in, and he stood so awkwardly and afraid in front of me.""

""I felt my heart filled with peace and forgiveness for this man. I had worked through my pain and I wasn't going to be carrying it,"" Liz said. She got off her bed, hugged her father, and they talked.

You don't have to be religious to find peace in the dying process, David Maginley tells Anna Maria Tremonti. 0:41

Maginley said that Liz died well, because she had done her homework.

""She had realized that to forgive is to set yourself free from the pain you've been carrying. It has no bearing upon what the other person has said, feels, thinks or does.""

Maginley's book tells of his personal and professional transformation through cancer.

Having 'open-hearted conversations'

If you do have a serious diagnosis, Maginley thinks it's important to have those conversations about palliative care early, even while you're still fighting for life.

""Those open-hearted conversations, I recognize, are profoundly difficult, but so empowering when everybody feels onboard, and you're able to make good choices.""

He said that from sitting with the dying, he's seen that regrets are never about finances or career accomplishments, but always relationships.

""It's the words we did not say … affirming love, or the words we did that just pushed love away,"" he said.

""I think most of us leave this world with broken bits and unfinished business.""

When former Jehovah's Witness Amber Scorah began to have doubts about her faith, she kept them private, even from her husband.

Until one night, she couldn't contain her questions anymore.

Scorah and her husband were reading about a new trend in the Jehovah's Witness community: learning Hebrew and Greek to study the bible in its original language.

""[That] seemed like a really great idea to me ... because I thought, like, what would we be afraid of?"" Scorah told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

However the article went on to condemn the trend, and said ""that the only place that we should be getting our understanding from was from what we called the governing body, who are essentially the leaders of the Jehovah's Witnesses.""

Scorah suddenly blurted out: ""Is this some kind of a cult or something?""

""My husband looked at me and was like, 'what did you just say?'

Scorah says that exclamation was a step in leaving her faith, being shunned by many of the people in her life, and trying to find her own way in the world. Originally from Vancouver, she now works as a writer and editor in New York, and has documented experience in Leaving The Witness: Exiting a Religion and Finding a Life.

Scorah has written about losing her faith in her new book Leaving The Witness: Exiting a Religion and Finding a Life. (Penguin Random House)

'The worst sin you can commit'

Scorah was a third-generation Jehovah's Witness. As her beliefs dictated, she had not gone to college and had only ever worked part time, to devote her time instead to trying to convert people to her faith.

Like others in her religion, Scorah believed that the apocalypse was imminent, and that at the end of the world, only those who devote themselves to the Jehovah's Witness faith would be saved.

""When you have that mentality, if you think you're a person who cares about people, you just want to try and save people's lives,"" she said.

But as the years went by, she began to doubt the absolute truth of her faith. However, she didn't dare tell anyone.

""It's a very dangerous thing to admit that you have doubts about the faith, because in our religion that's basically the worst sin you can commit,"" she said.

If a Jehovah's Witness does something that goes against the core rules of the church, they are asked to confess to a panel of elders, who then decide if they are repentant enough.

If they are deemed not to be, the church member can be ""disfellowshipped,"" meaning other members of the congregation will no longer speak to them, or even acknowledge them if they pass them on the street.

Scorah first revealed her doubts to her former husband while discussing an article about the bible. (Corey Perrine/Naples Daily News via Associated Press)

When Scorah's congregation found out about her doubts — through one of her Bible students — she was shunned, though not officially disfellowshipped.

""I was told that if I talk about this stuff, I will be disfellowshipped,"" she told Tremonti. ""In fact, they just told me to stay away ... if I wasn't willing to reform my thoughts back to where they should be.""

The Current requested interviews with the Jehovah's Witnesses International Organization, as well as its Canadian branch. Both declined, directing us to their website, which describes disfellowshipping as ""a loving provision.""

""Disfellowshipping may bring the wrongdoer to his senses,"" the site says, adding that it also ""protects the clean, Christian congregation.""

The website also addresses the question of whether the Jehovah's Witnesses are a cult, saying, in part, ""Far from being a dangerous cult, Jehovah's Witnesses practice a religion that benefits its members and others in the community.""

Scorah said that the word cult is ""very charged,"" but thinks she received ""retribution"" for what she calls a ""very moderate doubt.""

""It wasn't like I was ranting and raving in the congregation,"" she said. ""The reaction I got did not feel right, did not feel normal.""

Scorah was living in China when she left the church, and lost contact with a lot of the people in her life.

""I just didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. I didn't know how to live in the real world because I had been taught that that world was scary,"" she said.

Scorah now lives in New York. Building her new life has made every day more meaningful, she said. (Lucas Jackson)

Leaving showed her 'life is actually very beautiful'

Scorah left the church, and lost contact with her now former husband. She ended up living and working in the U.S.

Building a new life for herself was a long, lonely and difficult process, she said.

""I had to become outgoing even though I'm kind of a shy person, and just make friends, one at a time.

""Figure out how I would support myself, where I was going to live, it was basically just like starting a new life.""

She doesn't regret her decision, and said she would encourage former friends to ask questions about their beliefs, though the decision on whether to stay in the religion is up to them.

For her, leaving the certainties of her religion has given her a new take on life.

""Life is actually very beautiful,"" she told Tremonti.

""And when you realize it's not going to go on forever, even the day-to-day becomes more meaningful.""

1143,CBC Arts,Leah Collins Is The Senior Writer At Cbc Arts.,"Sameer Farooq can picture it already. The scene: the Visual Arts Centre of Clarington (VAC), a small public gallery in Bowmanville, about 100km east of Toronto. Inside, two rooms have been filled with dolls: stuffed dolls, souvenir dolls, Barbie dolls, Kewpie dolls.

And on one bonkers afternoon, it'll be ripped apart — by a mob of little kids.

""That's the goal,"" laughs Farooq. ""There's something so funny about this image of a hundred kids running through a museum and just destroying it, ransacking it."" If everything goes to plan, that's exactly how he's going to close his current exhibition, The BOOP Museum: with a cyclone of squeals and drool and plastic.

For the event, which goes down on July 5, kids get full permission to grab anything and everything in sight. In fact, they can keep whatever they get their jam hands on. According to VAC curator Sandy Saad, there's only one rule: ""You have to be a kid to take a doll.""

By ""kid,"" she means youngsters aged 4-8, and while complete event details are still TBD, the museum's website says kick-off is 4 p.m. Expect it all to go down in a flash, Supermarket Sweep-style. Farooq says he wants the event to have some sense of urgency. ""I don't think museum looting is ever done slowly,"" he says — a truism the children will likely prove through pure instinct.

There's something so funny about this image of a hundred kids running through a museum and just destroying it, ransacking it. - Sameer Farooq, artist

As for why any of this is happening in the first place, it helps to dip into the artist's C.V. a little.

Farooq, who was long-listed for the Sobey Art Award in 2018, has spent much of his career challenging the various traditions of western museums. What are they telling the public to think? What's missing from their archives? Moreover, who is missing? And how do the places themselves — from the Palladian windows to the plinths — convince visitors to buy in to a particular version of history?

Years ago, he began staging ""Museums of Found Objects"" with collaborator Mirjam Linschooten. In one notable example from 2011, the Art Gallery of Ontario invited them to respond to a special exhibit called Maharaja: The Splendour of India's Royal Courts. For the show, they crowdsourced everyday items from members of the local South Asian community — stuff like old sweatpants, a stack of Royal Chinet plates, anything that would be a whole lot more representative of Indo-Canadian life than jewels on loan from the Victoria and Albert. At the end, the public was invited to ""loot"" the place.

Items inside the BOOP Museum are often arranged by form: tall dolls, small dolls, dolls with puffy hats. (Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid/Courtesy of VAC)

And the word ""looting"" has some intentionally loaded meaning, considering museums have traditionally stocked their ethnographic collections by ""looting"" and pillaging themselves.

""What I'm trying to do with a lot of my projects where I invite people, invite the community, to loot the museum is to re-release objects back into everyday life,"" he says. ""It's to make the public really question the ways that we value certain things and don't value other things.""

But dolls?

""My other stuff is so much more serious,"" he laughs, but the BOOP Museum (named after a friend's child, nicknamed Boop) still shares the same DNA. Around the time Saad and Farooq began discussing a new exhibition of work at the VAC, the team at the neighbouring Clarington Museum and Archives were in the middle of pruning their collection.

""For as long as collections have been built, collections have also been de-accessioned because you have to think about what that collection means to your community,"" Saad explains. (If you want more info on the process, here's a helpful rundown from CBC News.)

""Basically,"" says Farooq, ""they said: 'You're an artist who works with museums. Would you like to have all these objects we're getting rid of?' It just suddenly fell in my lap. I suddenly inherited these hundreds and hundreds of objects.""

200 dolls, specifically. Nothing but dolls.

In one room of the BOOP Museum, dolls representing harmful cultural stereotypes are presented with their backs to the viewer. (Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid/Courtesy of VAC)

""I was quite terrified,"" jokes Farooq. ""I did think I would receive a diversity of objects, but when I saw they were all dolls I realized I had to suddenly become this artist who works with dolls, which is the biggest cliché.""

""But you know, after I worked through that, there was so much potential.""

Curiously, the museum began building a doll collection in the '60s, and according to the museum's executive director Heather Ridge, there are still more than 2,000 there. Most of the items likely came from local donors, she explains — that's the case for most everything in their collections. And the dolls that wound up in the BOOP Museum were de-accessioned because they no longer fit the collections policy, which ""was revised to better focus on local history."" To give you an example: if they didn't have documents proving a doll's Clarington County connection, it'd land in the cast-off pile.

It's to make the public really question the ways that we value certain things and don't value other things. - Sameer Farooq, artist

""It's heavily subjective,"" says Farooq. ""And that's my practice. It's really questioning: why do we collect the things we do? How do institutions write history through these objects?""

""I began to get very excited about the potential of just redirecting the dolls to a living culture rather than them sort of living and dying in the archive,"" he says.

""And then there's a potential for kids, especially, to imagine what they are — to put their own stories onto them and use them in whatever ways kids play with toys.""

Until July 5, however, the usual rules of ""look but don't touch"" are in effect at the BOOP Museum. But Farooq's installed everything with kids in mind. All the plinths and displays were specially built for someone between three and four feet tall. There aren't any didactic cards. Instead, Farooq channelled his inner four-year-old to label the items like a kid might. (""I love the naming systems that kids use on their own dolls, so every doll is kind of named in a very childlike way to make it enticing for them to take,"" he says.)

Only one room will be completely off limits on looting day. In that space, Farooq's done some de-accessioning on the BOOP Museum itself, removing ""problematic dolls"" from circulation by displaying them with their backs to visitors — in a darkened room, for extra drama. Generally speaking, the culled dolls represent exaggerated and violent cultural stereotypes.

Says Saad: ""When you enter, it's bright and it looks interesting and playful, but at its core it's a very critical assessment of the traditional museum model.""

But at the looting, Farooq says he hopes the youngest visitors get a different experience out of it.

""I think the greatest success is if these dolls can be part of the life world of these children for a little while and they can use them as they see fit,"" he says. A Dionne quint baby doll could be dragged into the sandbox. A 40-year-old Barbie could have her first haircut.

""I think I just want it to feel like the biggest score ever.""

Thomas McKechnie and I lived together for about a year. Several days a week, McKechnie would stumble home after a nine-hour shift as a Foodora bicycle courier, crash onto our couch and sprawl across the cushions. After an hour of pure exhaustion McKechnie — like clockwork — would open up his laptop and begin typing away at some script. He'd continue working on his writing late into the night. At around 2 in the morning he'd roll a cigarette, smoke on our porch then head off to bed. I rarely saw my roomate in the mornings. By the time I'd wake up he'd already be out the door on his bike, off to make a living delivering more food.

It isn't rare for artists to provide for themselves through other means than their art, but McKechnie's gig seemed particularly hard. His job with Foodora didn't come with set hours or benefits. There was no insurance in case of injury or allotted days off. While the gig afforded McKechnie the flexibility to pursue his creative passions, the position took a toll both physically and mentally. Day after day he'd continually hustle to afford living in Toronto, constantly aware of how little security there was with his work.

Meanwhile, as McKechnie was struggling with his day job, his artistic career was steadily rising. The playwright earned critical praise for his solo show 4 1/2 (ig)noble truths, trained at the prestigious Soulpepper Academy and had his work produced at venues across Canada. But even with the external success, McKechnie's focus was split between his writing and the precarious nature of his non-artistic work. If he couldn't bike, he didn't have a way to provide for himself. No matter how many accolades he achieved in drama, he didn't see a way out of that situation.

This year, McKechnie has taken great leaps forward, striving for new experiences with both his day job and his art. He was one of the people behind the effort to unionize Foodora, fighting for better conditions for the independent contractors. And themes of labour and unionization also also central to his latest play Remembering the Winnipeg General, a theatrical musing on the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. For McKechnie, pushing forward with a union and exploring the ideas in his art were both important steps to validating his struggles and the struggles of his peers.

The parallels between my situation and the situation in my play Remembering the Winnipeg General are actually heartbreakingly consistent with the realities of why I'm calling for a union. - Thomas McKechnie, playwright and bike courier

""My immediate goal for the union is to improve the lives of the workers at Foodora,"" he tells CBC Arts. ""We have a dangerous job and we have no protections when — not if — something goes wrong. We are given no time and no resources to recover from these inevitable injuries and are facing financial hardship, permanent injury or worse. All this for pay that hasn't risen in the nearly four years I've been with the company.""

""I think art is essential for communicating larger political ideas. Any political conviction that doesn't have artists working to support it will struggle to communicate. The parallels between my situation and the situation in my play Remembering the Winnipeg General are actually heartbreakingly consistent with the realities of why I'm calling for a union.""

100 years ago during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, over half of the city's workers walked off the job. What began as a dispute between construction workers and their bosses bloomed into a full-scale insurrection with people demanding better working conditions and the right to bargain collectively. The strike was eventually broken up by the Canadian government through a series of arrests, amongst fear of communism rising. McKechnie's show blends history, humour and music to bring the strike to life, with a particular emphasis on the roles immigrants and women played in the situation. For the playwright, his art is a chance to communicate the political reality of his day-to-day life in a digestible form.

""We're asking the audience to realize that the formations of power seen in the general strike could be built in the very room they're watching the play in: that solidarity and support is the secret to people's power,"" says McKechnie. ""I want work that evolves and changes — something that makes me grow as I do it and things that matter or have urgency to them. I like this in everything I do. That's what being a bike courier is like, it's what being a union organizer is like and it's what being a creator is like.""

The convergence of his interests in labour and theatre has made McKechnie truly passionate about this project. He hopes audiences leave the show with a renewed sense of ownership over their labour and a need to assert their rights. The goals are similar to what he's attempting with the union. Ultimately, with both efforts, McKechnie is hoping to communicate ideas that improve working conditions for everyone — even if the means of getting there are quite different.

The parallels between my situation and the situation in my play Remembering the Winnipeg General are actually heartbreakingly consistent with the realities of why I'm calling for a union. - Thomas McKechnie, playwright and bike courier

""My immediate goal for the union is to improve the lives of the workers at Foodora,"" he tells CBC Arts. ""We have a dangerous job and we have no protections when — not if — something goes wrong. We are given no time and no resources to recover from these inevitable injuries and are facing financial hardship, permanent injury or worse. All this for pay that hasn't risen in the nearly four years I've been with the company.""

""I think art is essential for communicating larger political ideas. Any political conviction that doesn't have artists working to support it will struggle to communicate.

100 years ago during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, over half of the city's workers walked off the job. What began as a dispute between construction workers and their bosses bloomed into a full-scale insurrection with people demanding better working conditions and the right to bargain collectively. The strike was eventually broken up by the Canadian government through a series of arrests, amongst fear of communism rising. McKechnie's show blends history, humour and music to bring the strike to life, with a particular emphasis on the roles immigrants and women played in the situation. For the playwright, his art is a chance to communicate the political reality of his day-to-day life in a digestible form.

""We're asking the audience to realize that the formations of power seen in the general strike could be built in the very room they're watching the play in: that solidarity and support is the secret to people's power,"" says McKechnie. ""I want work that evolves and changes — something that makes me grow as I do it and things that matter or have urgency to them. I like this in everything I do. That's what being a bike courier is like, it's what being a union organizer is like and it's what being a creator is like.""

The convergence of his interests in labour and theatre has made McKechnie truly passionate about this project. He hopes audiences leave the show with a renewed sense of ownership over their labour and a need to assert their rights. The goals are similar to what he's attempting with the union. Ultimately, with both efforts, McKechnie is hoping to communicate ideas that improve working conditions for everyone — even if the means of getting there are quite different.

Thomas McKechnie and I lived together for about a year. Several days a week, McKechnie would stumble home after a nine-hour shift as a Foodora bicycle courier, crash onto our couch and sprawl across the cushions. After an hour of pure exhaustion McKechnie — like clockwork — would open up his laptop and begin typing away at some script. He'd continue working on his writing late into the night. At around 2 in the morning he'd roll a cigarette, smoke on our porch then head off to bed. I rarely saw my roomate in the mornings. By the time I'd wake up he'd already be out the door on his bike, off to make a living delivering more food.

It isn't rare for artists to provide for themselves through other means than their art, but McKechnie's gig seemed particularly hard. His job with Foodora didn't come with set hours or benefits. There was no insurance in case of injury or allotted days off. While the gig afforded McKechnie the flexibility to pursue his creative passions, the position took a toll both physically and mentally. Day after day he'd continually hustle to afford living in Toronto, constantly aware of how little security there was with his work.

Meanwhile, as McKechnie was struggling with his day job, his artistic career was steadily rising. The playwright earned critical praise for his solo show 4 1/2 (ig)noble truths, trained at the prestigious Soulpepper Academy and had his work produced at venues across Canada. But even with the external success, McKechnie's focus was split between his writing and the precarious nature of his non-artistic work. If he couldn't bike, he didn't have a way to provide for himself. No matter how many accolades he achieved in drama, he didn't see a way out of that situation.

This year, McKechnie has taken great leaps forward, striving for new experiences with both his day job and his art.

1149,CBC Arts,Lise Hosein Is A Producer At Cbc Arts. Before That,"Meditating has been important to painter Sheri Bakes for a long time. While at a retreat in Indonesia, she had a deeply profound reaction to the practice. And now, meditation is built into her artistic process in a different way. When she was 29, Bakes had a stroke that resulted in the loss of her ability to imagine things visually — a condition referred to as aphantasia. Now, her experience in Indonesia and the aftermath of her stroke have combined to transform her into the artist she is today.

When Bakes goes into the landscape that surrounds her home in Vancouver Island, she takes away photographs of the things she wants to paint. As you'll see in the video below, made by filmmaker Daniel Lins da Silva, these pictures become essential to her process. ""I am internally blind, basically,"" says Bakes. ""If I try and work without a photograph, I get lost. It's like I have no bearings, like I can't form shapes in my mind, like I can't form anything. So the photograph, it gives me a map to follow."" See how Sheri Bakes paints her windswept landscapes in the video below.

Watch the video:

When Sheri Bakes lost her ability to use her visual imagination, she made her painting process into being in the moment. Filmmaker: Daniel Lins da Silva 4:52

While it might be tempting to see aphantasia as a challenge for Bakes, she has turned the process of painting into a meditative act. Once she knew she had the condition (she only found out in 2015), she gave up trying to get back a vision that was no longer accessible to her and worked on being in the moment. Now, she says that her job is to ""dissolve herself"" — to get out of her own way and use herself as a vehicle for whatever she is trying to express.

Bakes is not the only artist with aphantasia — earlier this year, an exhibition at the University of Glasgow featured work by people who are not able to visualize (they also featured works by people with hyperphantasia or an overactive visual imagination).

1154,CBC Arts,Leah Collins Is The Senior Writer At Cbc Arts.,"(Hulu/CBC News/VAC/Netflix/Instagram (@pickleandfrancois, @tux_and_fanny)/Last Gang/CBC Arts)

Hello! You're reading the CBC Arts newsletter, and if you like what you see, stick around! Sign up here, and every Sunday we'll send you a fresh email packed with art, culture and a metric truckload of eye candy, hand-picked by our small and mighty team. Here's what we've been talking about this week.

Hi, art lovers!

What are we reading?

The Art Gallery of Ontario auctioned 17 artworks by A.Y. Jackson this week, which prompted the team at CBC News to unpack why (and how) an institution goes about selling off bits of its collection. ""Deaccessioning"" is the proper word for it. And if you're at all curious about what's involved, definitely read their explainer. Curiously, the whole subject of how museums collect — and deaccession — their holdings happens to be the subject of a project by Sameer Farooq called the BOOP Museum. (It's going on at The Visual Arts Centre of Clarington right now.) All I'll say here is this: 1) there are creepy dolls and; 2) at the end of the exhibition, they're inviting kids to ""loot"" the place.

On the pop culture front, I'm counting down to the Season 3 premiere of The Handmaid's Tale (June 5!). Artsy charted the history of how the show's handmaid costumes have become ""visual icons"" of protest, an evolution that the Guardian's tracked before. (Same with Vanity Fair.) But is it time for demonstrators to hang them up? That's the argument in this recent column from the Washington Post.

Some updates on a few of the folks you've seen on CBC Arts: Calgary's Dena Seiferling, a.k.a. Pickle and Francois, is included in an official Hello Kitty art show. She Instagrammed a preview of her piece.Santee Smith and Esie Mensah, two of the choreographers featured on The Move, were nominated for Dora Awards this week. And to mark Pride, CBC's launched a special website that puts the spotlight on LGBTQ stories — including Queeries, the CBC Arts column from (newly minted Digital Publishing Award-winner!) Peter Knegt.

What are we watching?

The word ""essence"" is about to give a whole new generation the fear-barfs. The trailer for The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance arrived this week! The '80s vibes are also strong in the latest music video from Electric Youth. (They're the Toronto duo behind that ""real human bean"" song from Drive. Their new album, Memory Emotion, arrives Aug. 9.) Even more '80s vibes! As soon as I've sent this email, I'm bingeing the rest of this supremely bizarre Instagram cartoon Tux and Fanny. The guy behind it, Albert Birney, just compiled all of the Instagram posts into a feature-length film...that you can buy on VHS. Here's The New Yorker (over-)analyzing why it's worth your time.

And because we promised you eye candy

The world is your pencil case! Apparently there's such a thing as ""National Stationery Week"" in the U.K., and for that, be grateful — because now we have a gallery of public art that doubles as ""stationary stationery.""

As for GIFs on a (much, much, much) larger scale, peep the latest augmented reality mural from INSA. (Toronto readers might remember his ""GIF-iti"" installation at The Drake Hotel.)

You've got to see this

So you're applying for an artist grant - Step 1: Read this article. Hustling for funds can be a nightmare, but artist Hanan Hazime is here to guide you through the process.

Oh, Rocketma-a-a-a-a-aa-an. Rocketman! - Queeries columnist Peter Knegt loves the musical biopic as much as he hated Bohemian Rhapsody.

These objects spark joy...and pain and other heavy feelings - Love brings people together. And according to the Museum of Broken Relationships, the same could be said for heartbreak. This ongoing international art project is about to land in Toronto. Here's how you (and your ex's old pants) can be a part of it.

1155,CBC Arts,Peter Knegt Has Worked For Cbc Arts Since,"Queeries is a weekly column by CBC Arts producer Peter Knegt that queries LGBTQ art, culture and/or identity through a personal lens. It won the 2019 Digital Publishing Award for best digital column in Canada.

Last week on the opening night of Toronto's Inside Out LGBT Film Festival, as a group of us assembled outside the TIFF Bell Lightbox after watching Rocketman, there was clearly a bit of tension as we waited for the first person to announce their hot take. I decided to volunteer an opinion I hadn't exactly expected to walk out with: ""Um...I think I legitimately loved it!?""

Everyone exhaled, admitting they were all a little terrified I'd hated it because they'd all loved it too. And their anxiety was not unfair: they'd all witnessed me have what was essentially a four-month meltdown over Rocketman's unofficial predecessor Bohemian Rhapsody, first because of its problematic representation of queerness and generally trash filmmaking...and then because of how it became an Oscar-winning global box office phenomenon anyway. Which is not to say they all didn't mostly agree with me — they just weren't quite as dramatic about it.

""I would have avoided you so hard at the afterparty if you hated it,"" one friend said, laughing. But it was no joke: I would have avoided me too. (And I did avoid the few folks I ran into that didn't like it for reasons they're clearly entitled to but also I'm tired and can't we just have a nice thing?)

Rocketman. (Paramount)

Now, I'm certainly not the only one who has been very nervous about Rocketman these last few months. The on-paper similarities between it and Bohemian Rhapsody are pretty stark. Both films depict the lives of iconic queer rock stars who came to fame in the 1970s and struggled with both their sexuality and addiction. Both are rare studio films with a lead LGBTQ character, though they're written by and starring pretty much exclusively straight folks. Both are at least partially directed by Dexter Fletcher (who took over for Bryan Singer when he was fired from Rhapsody, and directed Rocketman in its entirety). They even share a character in John Reid, who managed both John and Queen and is played (very differently) by Richard Madden in Rocketman and Aidan Gillen in Rhapsody.

But to anyone apprehensive that these similarities might extend to both films sharing anything in terms of quality of filmmaking or representation of their lead character's sexuality, I say: go forth, queers. Rocketman is certainly a little superficial, but that doesn't stop it from being extremely joyous...and extremely gay (at least for a film getting this kind of release).

Starring Taron Egerton in a seismic performance that should shame any Academy member who voted for Rami Malek (not only did Egerton give actual soul to Elton John, but he actually sings!), Rocketman depicts John's life from childhood through his rise to fame, culminating with the drug and alcohol spiral that led him to get sober in 1990. This could feel like an all-too-familiar approach to the same ""fame corrupts"" narrative that Rhapsody mangled so badly, but Rocketman rises above the constraints of the standard biopic in part by also being...a full-fledged musical. While Queen's music was incorporated throughout Rhapsody with rehearsals, performances and a non-diegetic soundtrack, Rocketman's characters regularly burst into Elton John's songs. And as someone who has historically been pretty indifferent to his music (save a few tracks here and there) I found myself unexpectedly into every minute of it.

It helps that the lyrics to Elton John's songs — most written by his lifelong collaborator Bernie Taupin, played with great sensitivity in the film by Jamie Bell — connect themselves so nicely to narrative. There's a sequence toward the beginning of the film where a young Elton John (then known as Reggie Dwight and played by Kit Connor) and his entire family (including Bryce Dallas Howard as his free-spirited though unhappy mother and Steven Mackintosh as his stern, emotionally abusive father) share verses of John's 2001 single ""I Want Love."" Though John recently wrote that that song is actually about Taupin wondering if as ""a middle-aged man with a few divorces"" he will ever fall in love again, it perfectly suits the dysfunctional Dwight family dynamic. It also sets up what Rocketman really feels like at its core: the flashiest, most jubilant and certainly most expensive coming out movie ever made.

Though John comes out to Taupin midway through the film in one of its sweetest scenes, he continues to struggle to accept himself for the remainder of the run-time, falling into both cycles of substance abuse and a dangerous romantic relationship with manager Reid (played with the most sociopathic of sexiness by Madden) as a result. These same fates were exactly what met Malek's Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, but Rocketman handles them with the R-rated realness that could have partially saved Rhapsody. Explicitly seeing both John's drug use and the escalation of his sexual relationship with Reid — resulting in the most gay sex a Hollywood studio has ever put on screen — really allows a depth of understanding in what is driving John's behaviour, all aided by how vibrant and dedicated Egerton, Madden and Bell's performances are.

Rocketman. (Paramount )

This is not to say Rocketman is especially deep, but I feel like in this context it probably doesn't need to be. The road for so many queer folks to truly accept themselves and fully come out extends well beyond simply saying who we are out loud. This path and is more often than not littered with a lot of darkness, from toxic self-hatred to cycles of addiction to destructive sexual relationships. Rocketman does not hold back in showing what that looks like, and as result never feels like it's pandering to a straight audience as Bohemian Rhapsody did. But it does feel like it's keeping the path illuminated with just enough feathers and sequins to make it the truly joyful experience queer folks deserve to finally have in a big-budget musical representing their journeys. You'll walk out of Rocketman feeling proud of both yourself and Elton John for still standing, and grateful to Hollywood for maybe getting it right this time.","Queeries is a weekly column by CBC Arts producer Peter Knegt that queries LGBTQ art, culture and/or identity through a personal lens.

This could feel like an all-too-familiar approach to the same ""fame corrupts"" narrative that Rhapsody mangled so badly, but Rocketman rises above the constraints of the standard biopic in part by also being...a full-fledged musical. While Queen's music was incorporated throughout Rhapsody with rehearsals, performances and a non-diegetic soundtrack, Rocketman's characters regularly burst into Elton John's songs. And as someone who has historically been pretty indifferent to his music (save a few tracks here and there) I found myself unexpectedly into every minute of it.

It helps that the lyrics to Elton John's songs — most written by his lifelong collaborator Bernie Taupin, played with great sensitivity in the film by Jamie Bell — connect themselves so nicely to narrative. There's a sequence toward the beginning of the film where a young Elton John (then known as Reggie Dwight and played by Kit Connor) and his entire family (including Bryce Dallas Howard as his free-spirited though unhappy mother and Steven Mackintosh as his stern, emotionally abusive father) share verses of John's 2001 single ""I Want Love."" Though John recently wrote that that song is actually about Taupin wondering if as ""a middle-aged man with a few divorces"" he will ever fall in love again, it perfectly suits the dysfunctional Dwight family dynamic. It also sets up what Rocketman really feels like at its core: the flashiest, most jubilant and certainly most expensive coming out movie ever made.

Though John comes out to Taupin midway through the film in one of its sweetest scenes, he continues to struggle to accept himself for the remainder of the run-time, falling into both cycles of substance abuse and a dangerous romantic relationship with manager Reid (played with the most sociopathic of sexiness by Madden) as a result. These same fates were exactly what met Malek's Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, but Rocketman handles them with the R-rated realness that could have partially saved Rhapsody. Explicitly seeing both John's drug use and the escalation of his sexual relationship with Reid — resulting in the most gay sex a Hollywood studio has ever put on screen — really allows a depth of understanding in what is driving John's behaviour, all aided by how vibrant and dedicated Egerton, Madden and Bell's performances are.

This path and is more often than not littered with a lot of darkness, from toxic self-hatred to cycles of addiction to destructive sexual relationships.

Last week on the opening night of Toronto's Inside Out LGBT Film Festival, as a group of us assembled outside the TIFF Bell Lightbox after watching Rocketman, there was clearly a bit of tension as we waited for the first person to announce their hot take. I decided to volunteer an opinion I hadn't exactly expected to walk out with: ""Um...I think I legitimately loved it!?""

Everyone exhaled, admitting they were all a little terrified I'd hated it because they'd all loved it too. And their anxiety was not unfair: they'd all witnessed me have what was essentially a four-month meltdown over Rocketman's unofficial predecessor Bohemian Rhapsody, first because of its problematic representation of queerness and generally trash filmmaking...and then because of how it became an Oscar-winning global box office phenomenon anyway. Which is not to say they all didn't mostly agree with me — they just weren't quite as dramatic about it.

""I would have avoided you so hard at the afterparty if you hated it,"" one friend said, laughing. But it was no joke: I would have avoided me too. (And I did avoid the few folks I ran into that didn't like it for reasons they're clearly entitled to but also I'm tired and can't we just have a nice thing?)

Rocketman. (Paramount)

Now, I'm certainly not the only one who has been very nervous about Rocketman these last few months. The on-paper similarities between it and Bohemian Rhapsody are pretty stark. Both films depict the lives of iconic queer rock stars who came to fame in the 1970s and struggled with both their sexuality and addiction. Both are rare studio films with a lead LGBTQ character, though they're written by and starring pretty much exclusively straight folks. Both are at least partially directed by Dexter Fletcher (who took over for Bryan Singer when he was fired from Rhapsody, and directed Rocketman in its entirety). They even share a character in John Reid, who managed both John and Queen and is played (very differently) by Richard Madden in Rocketman and Aidan Gillen in Rhapsody.

But to anyone apprehensive that these similarities might extend to both films sharing anything in terms of quality of filmmaking or representation of their lead character's sexuality, I say: go forth, queers. Rocketman is certainly a little superficial, but that doesn't stop it from being extremely joyous...and extremely gay (at least for a film getting this kind of release).

While Queen's music was incorporated throughout Rhapsody with rehearsals, performances and a non-diegetic soundtrack, Rocketman's characters regularly burst into Elton John's songs. And as someone who has historically been pretty indifferent to his music (save a few tracks here and there) I found myself unexpectedly into every minute of it.

It helps that the lyrics to Elton John's songs — most written by his lifelong collaborator Bernie Taupin, played with great sensitivity in the film by Jamie Bell — connect themselves so nicely to narrative. There's a sequence toward the beginning of the film where a young Elton John (then known as Reggie Dwight and played by Kit Connor) and his entire family (including Bryce Dallas Howard as his free-spirited though unhappy mother and Steven Mackintosh as his stern, emotionally abusive father) share verses of John's 2001 single ""I Want Love."" Though John recently wrote that that song is actually about Taupin wondering if as ""a middle-aged man with a few divorces"" he will ever fall in love again, it perfectly suits the dysfunctional Dwight family dynamic. It also sets up what Rocketman really feels like at its core: the flashiest, most jubilant and certainly most expensive coming out movie ever made.

Though John comes out to Taupin midway through the film in one of its sweetest scenes, he continues to struggle to accept himself for the remainder of the run-time, falling into both cycles of substance abuse and a dangerous romantic relationship with manager Reid (played with the most sociopathic of sexiness by Madden) as a result. These same fates were exactly what met Malek's Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, but Rocketman handles them with the R-rated realness that could have partially saved Rhapsody. Explicitly seeing both John's drug use and the escalation of his sexual relationship with Reid — resulting in the most gay sex a Hollywood studio has ever put on screen — really allows a depth of understanding in what is driving John's behaviour, all aided by how vibrant and dedicated Egerton, Madden and Bell's performances are.

Rocketman. (Paramount )

This is not to say Rocketman is especially deep, but I feel like in this context it probably doesn't need to be. The road for so many queer folks to truly accept themselves and fully come out extends well beyond simply saying who we are out loud. This path and is more often than not littered with a lot of darkness, from toxic self-hatred to cycles of addiction to destructive sexual relationships. Rocketman does not hold back in showing what that looks like, and as result never feels like it's pandering to a straight audience as Bohemian Rhapsody did. But it does feel like it's keeping the path illuminated with just enough feathers and sequins to make it the truly joyful experience queer folks deserve to finally have in a big-budget musical representing their journeys. You'll walk out of Rocketman feeling proud of both yourself and Elton John for still standing, and grateful to Hollywood for maybe getting it right this time.","Queeries is a weekly column by CBC Arts producer Peter Knegt that queries LGBTQ art, culture and/or identity through a personal lens.

Lilly got her big break playing Kate Austen on the hugely popular television series Lost. When the series ended, she tried to retire from acting, but Hollywood kept luring her back with projects like Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy and roles like the Wasp in Marvel's Ant-Man franchise. Even so, Lilly has managed to make space for other parts of her creative identity.

Beyond acting, she's also the author of the children's book series The Squickerwonkers. Today, Lilly joins host Tom Power live in the q studio to talk about the latest book in the series, The Demise of Selma the Spoiled, which is out now.

If you're in Toronto, Lilly will be reading tonight at the Indigo at Bay and Bloor.

1166,CBC Arts,April Aliermo Is A Filipinx-Canadian Musician,"In 2010, my band Hooded Fang began our foray into the music industry, releasing our first full-length album. It had been a few years since I finished my master's degree in teaching, and after doing 22 consecutive years of full-time schooling, I couldn't bring myself to work full-time in an educational institution. Finally free of academic responsibility, I wanted to play in a band and needed a job to supplement this irrational desire to rock. I needed something that was lucrative but flexible. A lot of my other peers were in a similar circumstance: chasing their creative dreams but needing a way to pay rent.

This same year, a neighbourhood mom, Anna, was in need of childcare and invited me to run a home daycare from her house. It was unusual to hear, but she genuinely wanted to know what my ideal working conditions were. I told her that I wanted to make $20 an hour, to work three days a week and for my two other artist friends to work the other two days that I wasn't. She happily agreed to my terms — and an alternative system for working, learning and caring was born.

Kindergarten was still operating on a half-day cycle, so I spent 11:30am to 5:30pm with five 5-year-olds. Anna donated use of her residence as our home base, which kept operation costs really low and kept playschool fees comparable to other daycares. This model basically created affordable space, and maximized use of a place that was empty for the entire working day. Nevertheless, in order to meet the kids' interests — and to curb my own boredom around being in a house all day — the whole city became our playground.

On our excursions we explored the flora in High Park and the waves at Kew Beach but also the shiny towers of the Financial District. We frequented a range of art institutions, admiring Shary Boyle at the AGO, watching weird videos at the MOCA and understanding what an installation is at Show and Tell Gallery (now Cooper Cole). We learned about wigs in Little Jamaica and about sea creatures in Chinatown. Our urban explorations had no limits. Once we even took the TTC to Pearson Airport to watch planes take off and land. As the kids became comfortable moving through their city, they were empowered with a new sense of confidence and wonder.

Getting ready to record a song written with Hooded Fang's Daniel Lee. (Bellwoods Playschool)

We plugged into my community of creatives for guest artists. The kids wrote and recorded songs with my bandmate Daniel Lee (if marketed properly, ""Dancey Rocket Song"" should have won a Juno). They learned about patterns and ink drawing techniques with visual artist Leah Gold. We also infused our days with environmental and social justice. Some days, we would talk about Caesar Chavez and farmers' rights while visiting the Royal Winter Fair. Other days, we would observe workers' strikes happening outside of fancy hotels. (Fuelled by new inspiration, the kids protested against an excursion to Allen Gardens, fighting for their wishes to visit the adjacent dog park instead — they were obviously victorious.)

The playschool grew exponentially. By year three, we were 12 artist educators and two youth volunteers providing care for 45 families (they were also happy to donate use of their homes while they were at work). You would see groups of children gallivanting with musician Maylee Todd or Fuzzy Logic Recordings owner Maria Bui, and kids making art at Whipper Snapper Gallery with then-director Adrian Di Lena or dancing in a studio with community artist Julia Hune-Brown.

We operated as a small collective of businesses. Each of the artist educators had autonomy and flexibility. We all worked part-time with the kids and part-time with our own artistic practices. All the kids knew the entire team of artist caregivers and all the artist caregivers knew all the kids. Whenever I left for tour with Hooded Fang, I wouldn't miss that much work and it was easy for the other educators to cover for me. Each of the artists had this freedom as well and could take time off from playschool to focus on an upcoming show whenever needed.

Kulintang music demonstration. (Bellwoods Playschool)

This non-linear, flexible work structure supported the health and longevity of this alternative system. After three years, the ideas and framework were established. The collective didn't need any one person to run this network of home daycares — it sustained itself.

In 2014 my band put out our fourth full-length Gravez and I wanted to focus more time and energy on touring. It was hard to say goodbye to playschool, to something I helped build and grow, but it was time for me to move on. Now, nine years after its inception, there are still three groups running it as an afterschool program!

The playschool started with the need for childcare but ended up being a transformation of systems. It immersed kids in Toronto's arts, culture and urban landscape, provided artists with income and flexibility, made use of vacant space and built community. As our city rapidly grows, I am now wondering if it is possible to translate the ideas and alternative systems cultivated in this experimental childcare venture to alleviate some new pressures that are arising.

Trip to the zoo. (Bellwoods Playschool)

How can we maximize use of underutilized spaces in the city and transform them into affordable spaces? Are there ways they can be offered in exchange for something other than money? Can we imagine non-linear, collective processes to run other businesses? Can we co-share positions of power? Can there be lucrative part-time work for people who have pursuits independent of capitalism?

1171,CBC Arts,Lyrics For Hooded Fang,"In 2010, my band Hooded Fang began our foray into the music industry, releasing our first full-length album. It had been a few years since I finished my master's degree in teaching, and after doing 22 consecutive years of full-time schooling, I couldn't bring myself to work full-time in an educational institution. Finally free of academic responsibility, I wanted to play in a band and needed a job to supplement this irrational desire to rock. I needed something that was lucrative but flexible. A lot of my other peers were in a similar circumstance: chasing their creative dreams but needing a way to pay rent.

This same year, a neighbourhood mom, Anna, was in need of childcare and invited me to run a home daycare from her house. It was unusual to hear, but she genuinely wanted to know what my ideal working conditions were. I told her that I wanted to make $20 an hour, to work three days a week and for my two other artist friends to work the other two days that I wasn't. She happily agreed to my terms — and an alternative system for working, learning and caring was born.

Kindergarten was still operating on a half-day cycle, so I spent 11:30am to 5:30pm with five 5-year-olds. Anna donated use of her residence as our home base, which kept operation costs really low and kept playschool fees comparable to other daycares. This model basically created affordable space, and maximized use of a place that was empty for the entire working day. Nevertheless, in order to meet the kids' interests — and to curb my own boredom around being in a house all day — the whole city became our playground.

On our excursions we explored the flora in High Park and the waves at Kew Beach but also the shiny towers of the Financial District. We frequented a range of art institutions, admiring Shary Boyle at the AGO, watching weird videos at the MOCA and understanding what an installation is at Show and Tell Gallery (now Cooper Cole). We learned about wigs in Little Jamaica and about sea creatures in Chinatown. Our urban explorations had no limits. Once we even took the TTC to Pearson Airport to watch planes take off and land. As the kids became comfortable moving through their city, they were empowered with a new sense of confidence and wonder.

Getting ready to record a song written with Hooded Fang's Daniel Lee. (Bellwoods Playschool)

We plugged into my community of creatives for guest artists. The kids wrote and recorded songs with my bandmate Daniel Lee (if marketed properly, ""Dancey Rocket Song"" should have won a Juno). They learned about patterns and ink drawing techniques with visual artist Leah Gold. We also infused our days with environmental and social justice. Some days, we would talk about Caesar Chavez and farmers' rights while visiting the Royal Winter Fair. Other days, we would observe workers' strikes happening outside of fancy hotels. (Fuelled by new inspiration, the kids protested against an excursion to Allen Gardens, fighting for their wishes to visit the adjacent dog park instead — they were obviously victorious.)

The playschool grew exponentially. By year three, we were 12 artist educators and two youth volunteers providing care for 45 families (they were also happy to donate use of their homes while they were at work). You would see groups of children gallivanting with musician Maylee Todd or Fuzzy Logic Recordings owner Maria Bui, and kids making art at Whipper Snapper Gallery with then-director Adrian Di Lena or dancing in a studio with community artist Julia Hune-Brown.

We operated as a small collective of businesses. Each of the artist educators had autonomy and flexibility. We all worked part-time with the kids and part-time with our own artistic practices. All the kids knew the entire team of artist caregivers and all the artist caregivers knew all the kids. Whenever I left for tour with Hooded Fang, I wouldn't miss that much work and it was easy for the other educators to cover for me.

1173,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"When Ty Herndon was shooting the music video for the re-release of the song that launched his career, he became so emotional they had to stop filming.

To kick off Pride month, the gay country singer has re-recorded his 1995 chart-topping love song What Mattered Most with the lyrics changed to make it about a man.

""You know, I'm a pretty tough bird. I've been through a lot. But that little song started it all,"" Herndon told As It Happens host Carol Off.

""All these years of singing it one way, and then being able to sing it another with a bunch of my family and best friends sitting around — and this is the first time they heard it as well — I'm like, 'Oh, goodness gracious, we're having church up in here. Everybody's crying.'""

When he first started singing the song 25 years ago, a closeted Herndon would croon lyrics like, ""Her eyes are blue/Her hair is long.""

That version hit No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs charts and propelled Herndon to stardom.

Sometimes he would close his eyes and imagine he was singing his parents' love song, rather than his own, he said.

Other times, he'd imagine his then-partner — a long-haired, blue-eyed man who he kept a secret from his fans.

But in the new version, released on YouTube this week, Herdon sings about ""his eyes"" and ""his hair"" — swapping the pronouns to make the song more authentic to his own lived experience.

""To sing it that way 25 years ago was never in my mind,"" he said. ""I knew that I would probably be quite honestly taking my life in my hands if I did that.""

'My industry has embraced me'

But keeping such an integral part of his identity a secret was also putting his life in jeopardy.

""I went to great lengths to hide it and, you know, it almost cost me my life a couple of times,"" he said.

""But as my awesome mom says, you know, 'We're glad we didn't lose you. But it sure did become an awesome story for you.'""

Herndon says he's come a long way since those days. He's been out and proud since 2014, and has a partner of nine years who he calls the love of his life.

""I was fully prepared to walk away from my career just to live authentically and live on this planet with honesty and love — and by the grace of God, I didn't have to do that,"" he said. ""My industry has embraced me.""

Herndon speaks onstage during the 2017 Concert for Love & Acceptance on June 8, 2017, in Nashville, Tenn. (Rick Diamond/Getty Images for Love & Acceptance)

Since coming out to his fans, Herndon has made it his mission to give back to the LGBTQ community and make the country music industry a safer space for the next generation.

""I have so many kids say to me, 'We want to like country music, but country music doesn't like us,'"" he said.

The remake of What Mattered Most is for them, he said.

""That just seemed the right thing to do — to show these kids that, you know, I'm brave enough to sing it this way and you guys, you're brave enough to come to Nashville, and just, if you want to be in this community, that it's safe.""

AS IT HAPPENS: Why this Swedish tenor turned anti-gay hate mail into a song

And his mom approves as well.

""My mom's always been one of my biggest fans, but she's also been very honest with me over the years,"" he said.

""I drove my truck over and sat down and played it for her, and we had a few tears ... and she said, 'Son, I don't know how this is going to be perceived. It's never been done before.' But she said, 'I agree with you that it needs to be heard this way.'""

Herndon will be performing What Mattered Most Wednesday night at Nashville's Wildhorse Saloon for his annual Concert for Love and Acceptance in partnership with the LGBTQ rights organization GLAAD.

This DIY takes a decidedly different — even opposite — approach, blending bright hues and a little gold foil to create a vibrant abstract art piece that takes over an entire wall. While the end product may look a little intimidating, especially if you're planning to tackle it on your own, our tutorial focuses on freehand painting so you can let loose, stop overthinking every brush stroke, and still end up with a pretty spectacular statement wall.

8-12 cans of sample paint, in 4-5 colours of your choice (make sure you buy 1-2 shades of each colour so you can blend properly)

Painter's tape

Ladder

Empty condiment bottles

Water

Acrylic paint

A water-based sealer, like Mod Podge

1175,CBC Arts,Amanda Parris Writes A Weekly Column For Cbc Arts,"Photos don't do it justice. Nep Sidhu's work is profound and immense. His tapestries require a prolonged gaze to see all of the detail. His sculptures are layered in meaning and my brain can't even begin to wrap around his video work.

Over the past few years, Sidhu has crafted a reputation for himself as an artist who traces connections across time, space and communities. And from his futuristic sculpture/pinball machines to his fantastic golden sculptural gowns, Sidhu is not tethered to a singular form or medium.

This week, his solo exhibition Medicine for a Nightmare (they called, we responded) opens at the Audain Gallery in Vancouver. For the show, the Scarborough-based artist zeroes in on his Sikh heritage and considers the memories around a painful chapter in Sikh history.

In 1984 the Indian military invaded the Harmandir Sahib (often called the Golden Temple), a Sikh holy site. The massacre of thousands that ensued was known by the code name Operation Blue Star.

In his monumental 220 x 108'' tapestry ""Medicine for a Nightmare,"" Sidhu uses materials such as cotton, wool, jute, zari, hair and steel to depict the sacred entrance to a holy shrine. It's genuinely staggering to behold. The open door suggests an invitation and is a reminder of the line that was crossed on that fateful day in 1984.

Nep Sidhu. Medicine for a Nightmare (from the series When My Drums Come Knocking, They Watch), 2019. (Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid/Courtesy of Mercer Union)

Sidhu's work has garnered the interest of some high-profile admirers and collaborators including Erykah Badu (who showed up for the exhibition's opening night at Toronto's Mercer Union) and Ishmael Butler from the group Shabazz Palaces.

I went to see the show when it was in Toronto earlier this year, and I spoke with Sidhu over email about the themes behind his work.

Amanda Parris: I read that you spent a year crafting one of your tapestries. Can you tell me about the process of making them?

Nep Sidhu: The process for the ""Medicine for a Nightmare"" tapestry was myself and a team of 12 people. We were staring down time in going for such an ambitious work.

For a portion of the effort I worked with a studio run by Olivia Dar in New Delhi. We have been able to find a routine and sequence in working with such scale. That said, it didn't help that halfway I abandoned my works [that] I had created at that point. I'm grateful to all those that came for the ride with me in helping to cross the finish line.

Where do the textiles come from?

Besides the gold zari, all of the cotton and wool is hand-dyed within New Delhi. From there it is all hand embroidery and painting on muslin.

Your work transcends any single material. When did you begin creating and what was the first material you used?

I spent a big part of my youth sketching, mostly. We weren't allowed toys at temple, so I managed to make forms out of the tissues I would have on me. So I guess that was form and sculpture happening — until my parents realized that I was paying no attention in gurdwara.

A lot of artists talk about their connection to land, but you brought in literal dirt for your show. Where did it come from? Why was this important to include?

During the three-day attack on the Golden Temple, many were diving into the waters that surrounded the temple to save their lives. Being allowed to bring that same dirt that shared those waters was charging. The potential in having this object conduct such a memory was brought together by a shared belief in the power of the invisible.

It was an opportunity to allow the honesty of materials to commune and make possible an object that could go past a government's attempt at erasure and brutality toward Sikhs. It was an opportunity to allow generations to have the agents of space and place activated so that we could commune, on nature's terms, with our folks that are on the other side. It points to an interdependence in how we need to be able to see and feel one another for true advancement.

Your work is steeped in history and creating connections across seemingly disparate subjects and communities. What was your research process like? How did that translate into your artistic process?

A lot of my research was taken from life experiences back home in Punjab. With such an intense and violent event that furthered into other strategies of torture and elimination, it was important to speak to a range of people both inside the country and here in Canada.

There are transnational identities and threads to the experience which are also important to share our experiences, reactions and the ways forward. I also wanted to bring forward the brilliant work of Jaswant Singh Kalra and Ensaaf, who continue in the pursuit of ending impunity and achieving justice for crimes against humanity in India, with a special focus on Punjab.

The Sikh community was one of your target audiences for this show. How has the community responded to your show?

Being involved in such an exchange has been quite moving, especially [hearing] the lively responses from younger minds [who] are beginning to express and think about their ideas, whether it has a direct connection to identity or not.

You're invoking memories that are painful and are part of a collective trauma. How do you take care of yourself in that process? What goes into your consideration when thinking about the audience that will eventually see it?

[Art writer] Ricky Varghese had shared an idea by Rebecca Comay which I thought really spoke to the questions I was exploring when building this show: ""How to commemorate an event which both demands and refuses commemoration; where all available cultural forms threaten to trivialize, sentimentalize, mystify, embellish, instrumentalize, or otherwise betray the memory of the dead; and where every attempt to acknowledge injury seems to compound it."" In looking to not dishonour the multiplicity in the experience of such an event, I focused on expressing the experience of Simran and Seva — without the constructs of myths, jargon, rituals and political exploitation of Sikh people.

I also wanted to bring forward the brilliant work of Jaswant Singh Kalra and Ensaaf, who continue in the pursuit of ending impunity and achieving justice for crimes against humanity in India, with a special focus on Punjab.

The Sikh community was one of your target audiences for this show. How has the community responded to your show?

Being involved in such an exchange has been quite moving, especially [hearing] the lively responses from younger minds [who] are beginning to express and think about their ideas, whether it has a direct connection to identity or not.

You're invoking memories that are painful and are part of a collective trauma. How do you take care of yourself in that process? What goes into your consideration when thinking about the audience that will eventually see it?

[Art writer] Ricky Varghese had shared an idea by Rebecca Comay which I thought really spoke to the questions I was exploring when building this show: ""How to commemorate an event which both demands and refuses commemoration; where all available cultural forms threaten to trivialize, sentimentalize, mystify, embellish, instrumentalize, or otherwise betray the memory of the dead; and where every attempt to acknowledge injury seems to compound it."" In looking to not dishonour the multiplicity in the experience of such an event, I focused on expressing the experience of Simran and Seva — without the constructs of myths, jargon, rituals and political exploitation of Sikh people.

Sidhu's work has garnered the interest of some high-profile admirers and collaborators including Erykah Badu (who showed up for the exhibition's opening night at Toronto's Mercer Union) and Ishmael Butler from the group Shabazz Palaces.

I went to see the show when it was in Toronto earlier this year, and I spoke with Sidhu over email about the themes behind his work.

Amanda Parris: I read that you spent a year crafting one of your tapestries. Can you tell me about the process of making them?

Nep Sidhu: The process for the ""Medicine for a Nightmare"" tapestry was myself and a team of 12 people. We were staring down time in going for such an ambitious work.

For a portion of the effort I worked with a studio run by Olivia Dar in New Delhi. We have been able to find a routine and sequence in working with such scale. That said, it didn't help that halfway I abandoned my works [that] I had created at that point. I'm grateful to all those that came for the ride with me in helping to cross the finish line.

Where do the textiles come from?

Besides the gold zari, all of the cotton and wool is hand-dyed within New Delhi. From there it is all hand embroidery and painting on muslin.

Your work transcends any single material. When did you begin creating and what was the first material you used?

I spent a big part of my youth sketching, mostly. We weren't allowed toys at temple, so I managed to make forms out of the tissues I would have on me. So I guess that was form and sculpture happening — until my parents realized that I was paying no attention in gurdwara.

A lot of artists talk about their connection to land, but you brought in literal dirt for your show. Where did it come from? Why was this important to include?

During the three-day attack on the Golden Temple, many were diving into the waters that surrounded the temple to save their lives. Being allowed to bring that same dirt that shared those waters was charging. The potential in having this object conduct such a memory was brought together by a shared belief in the power of the invisible.

It was an opportunity to allow the honesty of materials to commune and make possible an object that could go past a government's attempt at erasure and brutality toward Sikhs. It was an opportunity to allow generations to have the agents of space and place activated so that we could commune, on nature's terms, with our folks that are on the other side. It points to an interdependence in how we need to be able to see and feel one another for true advancement.

Your work is steeped in history and creating connections across seemingly disparate subjects and communities. What was your research process like? How did that translate into your artistic process?

A lot of my research was taken from life experiences back home in Punjab. With such an intense and violent event that furthered into other strategies of torture and elimination, it was important to speak to a range of people both inside the country and here in Canada.

Your work transcends any single material. When did you begin creating and what was the first material you used?

I spent a big part of my youth sketching, mostly. We weren't allowed toys at temple, so I managed to make forms out of the tissues I would have on me. So I guess that was form and sculpture happening — until my parents realized that I was paying no attention in gurdwara.

A lot of artists talk about their connection to land, but you brought in literal dirt for your show. Where did it come from? Why was this important to include?

During the three-day attack on the Golden Temple, many were diving into the waters that surrounded the temple to save their lives. Being allowed to bring that same dirt that shared those waters was charging. The potential in having this object conduct such a memory was brought together by a shared belief in the power of the invisible.

It was an opportunity to allow the honesty of materials to commune and make possible an object that could go past a government's attempt at erasure and brutality toward Sikhs. It was an opportunity to allow generations to have the agents of space and place activated so that we could commune, on nature's terms, with our folks that are on the other side. It points to an interdependence in how we need to be able to see and feel one another for true advancement.

Your work is steeped in history and creating connections across seemingly disparate subjects and communities. What was your research process like? How did that translate into your artistic process?

A lot of my research was taken from life experiences back home in Punjab. With such an intense and violent event that furthered into other strategies of torture and elimination, it was important to speak to a range of people both inside the country and here in Canada.

There are transnational identities and threads to the experience which are also important to share our experiences, reactions and the ways forward. I also wanted to bring forward the brilliant work of Jaswant Singh Kalra and Ensaaf, who continue in the pursuit of ending impunity and achieving justice for crimes against humanity in India, with a special focus on Punjab.

The Sikh community was one of your target audiences for this show. How has the community responded to your show?

Being involved in such an exchange has been quite moving, especially [hearing] the lively responses from younger minds [who] are beginning to express and think about their ideas, whether it has a direct connection to identity or not.

You're invoking memories that are painful and are part of a collective trauma. How do you take care of yourself in that process? What goes into your consideration when thinking about the audience that will eventually see it?

[Art writer] Ricky Varghese had shared an idea by Rebecca Comay which I thought really spoke to the questions I was exploring when building this show: ""How to commemorate an event which both demands and refuses commemoration; where all available cultural forms threaten to trivialize, sentimentalize, mystify, embellish, instrumentalize, or otherwise betray the memory of the dead; and where every attempt to acknowledge injury seems to compound it."" In looking to not dishonour the multiplicity in the experience of such an event, I focused on expressing the experience of Simran and Seva — without the constructs of myths, jargon, rituals and political exploitation of Sikh people.

1182,CBC Arts,Dreamed Of Being Interviewed Oprah.,"Photos don't do it justice. Nep Sidhu's work is profound and immense. His tapestries require a prolonged gaze to see all of the detail. His sculptures are layered in meaning and my brain can't even begin to wrap around his video work.

Over the past few years, Sidhu has crafted a reputation for himself as an artist who traces connections across time, space and communities. And from his futuristic sculpture/pinball machines to his fantastic golden sculptural gowns, Sidhu is not tethered to a singular form or medium.

This week, his solo exhibition Medicine for a Nightmare (they called, we responded) opens at the Audain Gallery in Vancouver. For the show, the Scarborough-based artist zeroes in on his Sikh heritage and considers the memories around a painful chapter in Sikh history.

In 1984 the Indian military invaded the Harmandir Sahib (often called the Golden Temple), a Sikh holy site. The massacre of thousands that ensued was known by the code name Operation Blue Star.

In his monumental 220 x 108'' tapestry ""Medicine for a Nightmare,"" Sidhu uses materials such as cotton, wool, jute, zari, hair and steel to depict the sacred entrance to a holy shrine. It's genuinely staggering to behold. The open door suggests an invitation and is a reminder of the line that was crossed on that fateful day in 1984.

Nep Sidhu. Medicine for a Nightmare (from the series When My Drums Come Knocking, They Watch), 2019. (Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid/Courtesy of Mercer Union)

Sidhu's work has garnered the interest of some high-profile admirers and collaborators including Erykah Badu (who showed up for the exhibition's opening night at Toronto's Mercer Union) and Ishmael Butler from the group Shabazz Palaces.

I went to see the show when it was in Toronto earlier this year, and I spoke with Sidhu over email about the themes behind his work.

Amanda Parris: I read that you spent a year crafting one of your tapestries. Can you tell me about the process of making them?

Nep Sidhu: The process for the ""Medicine for a Nightmare"" tapestry was myself and a team of 12 people. We were staring down time in going for such an ambitious work.

For a portion of the effort I worked with a studio run by Olivia Dar in New Delhi. We have been able to find a routine and sequence in working with such scale. That said, it didn't help that halfway I abandoned my works [that] I had created at that point. I'm grateful to all those that came for the ride with me in helping to cross the finish line.

Where do the textiles come from?

She was flipping through his Grade 12 art book soon after he finished high school and noticed his talent for drawing.

One in particular stood out and sparked a business idea.

""I saw a little snowman drawing and, literally, the light bulb went off — I thought this would be the cutest card for friends and families,"" Lynn Varley said.

Keegan Varley, of Richmond, B.C., has a unique perspective on the world because he lives with Down syndrome.

Today, he pours that perspective and his creativity into greeting cards, through a company called Keegan's Cards.

Keegan (middle) pictured with his brother Zach left, and his mother Lynn. (Keegan The Card Maker/Creator Network )

The card business is a family affair: Keegan Varley starts the ball rolling with his drawings, his mother traces them over and his brother Zach digitalizes them with colour for print.

The captions in the card are often a team effort.

""It kind of hops between the three of us,"" said Zach Varley.

""He comes up the ideas. I wouldn't come up with an idea for an owl or draw it with such character, but it's fun getting to take that drawing and add in how I interrupt it with a pop of colour.""

The cards are sold at craft fairs and stores around Vancouver.

Keegan Varley hopes to one day sell his cards in an art gallery.

1185,CBC Arts,Hanan Hazime Is A Multidisciplinary Artist,"If there's one thing that can reduce even the most stoic of artists to tears, it's grant writing. Whether you're drafting a grant proposal for the Canada Council for the Arts or a provincial or regional funder, getting through all the paperwork and budgeting can be a total nightmare. Fortunately, there are things that can help make the process a bit less painful, and as a seasoned grant writer, I've stored a few tips up my sleeve. I can't guarantee that you'll receive the funding you're after, but if you follow these guidelines, you'll definitely have a better chance at securing a slice of that delicious grant pie!

Research, research, research

The first step is to collect as much information as you can about the different funding opportunities available in your arts field. You need to find out which funding packages best fit the vision you have for your project. From individual artist grants for small scale projects, like writing a novel, to group grants for large scale projects, such as international exhibitions, there are plenty of funding options to choose from. In fact, the choices can be overwhelming. That's why it's important to research all your options thoroughly.

Browsing the sites of government, non-profit and corporate funders is a good place to start, but make sure you network with other artists and art organizations in person, too, by attending relevant industry events and conferences. Don't be shy to inquire about their funding sources and for advice on how to adapt your project idea for specific funders.

The program officer is your new BFF

OK, so you've spoken to other artists, and you've read the online guidelines provided by the funders. You think you have an inkling about which program matches your artistic goals, but you're still not sure if your project is indeed eligible for funding, as you're having trouble wading through all the bureaucratic jargon. Now what? It's time to email a grant officer to arrange a phone call or in-person meeting.

Usually the program officer's name and email will be listed in the contact section on the funder's website. Trust me: talking to an actual human who can decipher all that grant speak will help make the application process so much easier and smoother. Go to the meeting armed with a list of meaningful questions to get the most out of your conversation, take notes and don't be afraid to ask seemingly silly questions — program officers are there to help.

Stay in touch with your officer through email or by phone if you have additional questions (I personally find connecting via phone to be much more effective than engaging in email Ping-Pong). Then, once you've finished a rough draft of your proposal, ask the program officer if they wouldn't mind looking it over for you. I've found most officers are happy to provide feedback.

Tackling the mound of paperwork may seem insurmountable, so you may be tempted to put it off. But I promise that if you break it up into smaller chunks, you'll manage to get through it all with far less stress. - Hanan Hazime

Give yourself plenty of time to work on the application

Remember back in high school when your English teacher said you shouldn't write your essay the night before it's due, but you didn't listen to her and were up at 4 a.m. downing coffee after coffee and hurling Elizabethan-era curses at Shakespeare? Well, you really, and I mean really should not attempt to write your grant proposal the day before it's due — or even the week before.

Tackling the mound of paperwork may seem insurmountable, so you may be tempted to put it off. But I promise that if you break it up into smaller chunks, you'll manage to get through it all with far less stress. Schedule designated grant writing days at least a month before the deadline. Dedicate a couple hours per day to working on a small section of your proposal, and before you know it, you'll have completed the entire application.

Most grant applications can be completed online, but I highly recommend that you first answer the questions in a separate document (or even in a notebook), then transfer your responses into the application. You don't want to accidentally lose all your hard work due to a glitch.

Create a realistic budget (don't ask for too little — or too much)

Ah, the budget. This may feel like the most overwhelming part of the application, but crunching numbers isn't that scary if you break up the work. You want to show the grant committee that you know your stuff and have thought the budget through. Double-check what expenses are eligible for your specific grant, and make sure that all your revenues and expenses balance out.

Depending on the scope and length of your project, your budget breakdown might differ, but here are some general expenses to consider when creating your budget:

Cost of supplies or equipment: The best way to add up the cost of the materials you will be using is to go on a virtual shopping trip. To figure out the budget for a painting project grant, I visited my favourite art shop's website and added all the items I thought I would need to my cart. This gave me a good estimate for the materials portion of the budget.

Venue fees: Whether you're renting a venue for a workshop, exhibit, performance or to use as a studio, you'll need to include venue fees in your budget. You may be able to find the required information on the venue's site, but give yourself a bit of time as you may need to email or call the venue and inquire about their fees.

Accessibility expenses: If you need to make your project more accessible for yourself, other artists and/or the audience, you might want to calculate projected accessibility expenses such as ASL interpretation, ramp installation and so on. The best way to do this is to consult friends, colleagues or advocates from the deaf and disabled communities and ask them what accommodations they may require so that you can budget for them.

Artist fees and other staffing expenses: All artists involved in the project (including yourself) deserve to be fairly compensated for their work. Do some research to find out what professional artist fees are typical in your field. You may find it helpful to consult CARFAC for fees related to the visual arts and PWAC for fees related to writing. And don't forget to allocate a portion of your budget toward administrative staff fees if your project will require such work.

Other project expenses: Some grants allow you to budget for expenses such as transportation, food, training, marketing and outreach, honorariums, accommodations, and other project-related expenses. For instance, if you're holding community art workshops, you may want to provide participants with food and transportation stipends to make the classes more financially accessible. Check your grant guidelines to see if you can include such expenses in your budget.

Try to secure in-kind donations or other sources of funding

Some grants require you to have alternate sources of funding as they will not cover 100 per cent of your project budget. An excellent way to finance some of your project expenses is to partner up with a local arts organization or business that may be able to provide you with in-kind donations. For example, a community arts centre may allow you to use its space free of charge. You may also opt to do an ""energy exchange"" with other artists or art organizations (a way to pay for things with work and time, as opposed to money). You should still include the monetary value of the in-kind donations or energy exchanges in your budget.

Proofread and edit the application before submitting it

When you've finally completed the application, give yourself a pat on the back, then ask a few of your more grammar-oriented friends to proofread it for you. Make sure that you have answered all the questions in full, but also watch out for word limits; while you want to be thorough, you should aim to keep your writing succinct and clear.

Once you have edited and revised your answers until they're as perfect as you can possibly make them, simply copy and paste them into the online application.

Then, once you've finished a rough draft of your proposal, ask the program officer if they wouldn't mind looking it over for you. I've found most officers are happy to provide feedback.

Tackling the mound of paperwork may seem insurmountable, so you may be tempted to put it off. But I promise that if you break it up into smaller chunks, you'll manage to get through it all with far less stress. - Hanan Hazime

Give yourself plenty of time to work on the application

Remember back in high school when your English teacher said you shouldn't write your essay the night before it's due, but you didn't listen to her and were up at 4 a.m. downing coffee after coffee and hurling Elizabethan-era curses at Shakespeare? Well, you really, and I mean really should not attempt to write your grant proposal the day before it's due — or even the week before.

Tackling the mound of paperwork may seem insurmountable, so you may be tempted to put it off. But I promise that if you break it up into smaller chunks, you'll manage to get through it all with far less stress. Schedule designated grant writing days at least a month before the deadline. Dedicate a couple hours per day to working on a small section of your proposal, and before you know it, you'll have completed the entire application.

Most grant applications can be completed online, but I highly recommend that you first answer the questions in a separate document (or even in a notebook), then transfer your responses into the application. You don't want to accidentally lose all your hard work due to a glitch.

Create a realistic budget (don't ask for too little — or too much)

Ah, the budget. This may feel like the most overwhelming part of the application, but crunching numbers isn't that scary if you break up the work. You want to show the grant committee that you know your stuff and have thought the budget through. Double-check what expenses are eligible for your specific grant, and make sure that all your revenues and expenses balance out.

Depending on the scope and length of your project, your budget breakdown might differ, but here are some general expenses to consider when creating your budget:

Cost of supplies or equipment: The best way to add up the cost of the materials you will be using is to go on a virtual shopping trip. To figure out the budget for a painting project grant, I visited my favourite art shop's website and added all the items I thought I would need to my cart. This gave me a good estimate for the materials portion of the budget.

Venue fees: Whether you're renting a venue for a workshop, exhibit, performance or to use as a studio, you'll need to include venue fees in your budget. You may be able to find the required information on the venue's site, but give yourself a bit of time as you may need to email or call the venue and inquire about their fees.

Accessibility expenses: If you need to make your project more accessible for yourself, other artists and/or the audience, you might want to calculate projected accessibility expenses such as ASL interpretation, ramp installation and so on. The best way to do this is to consult friends, colleagues or advocates from the deaf and disabled communities and ask them what accommodations they may require so that you can budget for them.

Artist fees and other staffing expenses: All artists involved in the project (including yourself) deserve to be fairly compensated for their work. Do some research to find out what professional artist fees are typical in your field. You may find it helpful to consult CARFAC for fees related to the visual arts and PWAC for fees related to writing. And don't forget to allocate a portion of your budget toward administrative staff fees if your project will require such work.

Other project expenses: Some grants allow you to budget for expenses such as transportation, food, training, marketing and outreach, honorariums, accommodations, and other project-related expenses. For instance, if you're holding community art workshops, you may want to provide participants with food and transportation stipends to make the classes more financially accessible. Check your grant guidelines to see if you can include such expenses in your budget.

Try to secure in-kind donations or other sources of funding

Some grants require you to have alternate sources of funding as they will not cover 100 per cent of your project budget. An excellent way to finance some of your project expenses is to partner up with a local arts organization or business that may be able to provide you with in-kind donations. For example, a community arts centre may allow you to use its space free of charge. You may also opt to do an ""energy exchange"" with other artists or art organizations (a way to pay for things with work and time, as opposed to money). You should still include the monetary value of the in-kind donations or energy exchanges in your budget.

Proofread and edit the application before submitting it

When you've finally completed the application, give yourself a pat on the back, then ask a few of your more grammar-oriented friends to proofread it for you. Make sure that you have answered all the questions in full, but also watch out for word limits; while you want to be thorough, you should aim to keep your writing succinct and clear.

Once you have edited and revised your answers until they're as perfect as you can possibly make them, simply copy and paste them into the online application. Give the application one final check, and hit that submit button!","Research, research, researchThe first step is to collect as much information as you can about the different funding opportunities available in your arts field.

Along with bands like the Viletones and the Diodes, Teenage Head were at the heart of the explosion of creativity that was Toronto's punk scene in the '70s. Unlike those bands, they weren't downtown kids. They were from working class Hamilton, Ont., a city known for its steel mills and the CFL's Tiger Cats.

Their frontman, the notorious Frankie Venom, passed away in 2008, but the band is still playing today with their old friend Dave Rave on vocals.

To celebrate the re-release of their first album, bass player Steve Mahon takes us through the story of how four teenagers from Hamilton came to be Teenage Head.

1189,CBC Arts,Leah Collins Is The Senior Writer At Cbc Arts.,"Imagine this: the world's oldest breakup text is discovered by archaeologists. Technically, it's a stone tablet, but the thing still captures a familiar story — one that maybe felt a little fresher in the 6th Century BCE. The sender's a Neo-Babylonian king, a guy who goes into scorched earth mode after hearing ""one of his favourite concubines"" is getting cozy with his best friend. ""I am devastated by this betrayal,"" he writes. ""You have until the end of the month to pick up your flax shawls and sandals or else I will donate them to the temple of the moon god.""

So, maybe that was just some April Fool's headline from earlier this year. (It was.)

But phoney or not, the gag works because we all know the plot. Breakups are universal, transcending time and place (and logic), and the same goes for some of the bad habits that go with them, like clinging to weird little mementos from better days: ticket stubs, threadbare T-shirts — or a 2,000-year-old letter from the ex.

If and when it's time to let that stuff go, The Museum of Broken Relationships will be waiting. And through June 2, they're especially hoping to receive an influx of donations from Toronto.

This summer (June 28 – Sept. 8), the city's Harbourfront Centre will host the Museum as part of their slate of Brave Festival programming, and to pull it off, they need some help from the public.

Do you have any keepsakes that spark joy — and pain, among other heavy emotions?

What's inside?

Since its invention in 2006, the Museum has collected the ""objects that won't let people forget.""

Back then, co-founders Olinka Vištica and Dražen Grubišic — a one-time couple who've since turned their ""broken relationship"" into a decade-plus artistic partnership — thought it would be a one-off exhibition. By 2010, they'd opened a permanent location in Zagreb in addition to ongoing satellite exhibitions that have reached more than 50 international locations. The upcoming Toronto show is just one recent example, and it's the second time the Museum's appeared in Canada. The Yukon Arts Centre in Whitehorse welcomed it in 2015.

In addition to a book published in 2017, selections from the Museum's extensive archive can be seen online.

""The objects look banal, and then the story is like a punch in the gut,"" says Laura McLeod, director of cultural engagement at the Harbourfront Centre, and every account is written in the donors' own words. That premise might sound scary — or at least more involved than just shipping your stuff to Croatia. But according to Vištica, the project's confessional aspect is usually what compels people to get in touch.

""I think there is some beauty in parting and in sadness,"" she says, ""and there are not so many platforms that you can speak about that in public.""

""I think people want to forget, but at the same time, they would like their story to be meaningful — to sort some sense out of it. And while you are putting it on paper, I think you are actually doing that.""

It's the same as someone channeling their loss into, say, the ultimate breakup album. And since we're not all Adele, the Museum offers a unique opportunity. ""You are hoping it's going to be exhibited. You are imagining this other human being who is going to read your story and connect to it.""

Museum of Broken Relationships co-founders Olinka Vištica and Dražen Grubišic. (Courtesy of the Harbourfront Centre)

""By becoming a part of the museum, a part of a public experience, it's no longer so painful,"" she explains. ""It stops being personal and it becomes more human than individual.""

""This wish to forget, to heal, to transform, but at the same time to tell, is one of the main reasons I think people donate. It is cathartic.""

So how do people contribute?

There are no hard rules when it comes to submissions. Even the definition of ""broken relationship"" is entirely open to interpretation, so don't think the project's strictly confined to bad romance. They've collected stories about family relationships, business relationships — even the relationships people have to their own identities.

And though they're presently focused on recruiting Toronto-based contributors, anyone, anywhere, can reach the Museum through their website.

A few important details to note: donations are anonymous, but once they're received by the Museum, they will remain in their care forever. The entire collection, which currently comprises more than 3,500 items, is stored in Zagreb, but like any museum, they only show a fraction of their holdings at a given time, displaying selections at their brick-and-mortar location in addition to various travelling shows.

'The common language of loss and love'

Says Vištica: ""We try to put it all together in order to create a story about how humans love and lose, which is a story about how connected we all are."" And that thread has become more compelling as the project reaches more places around the world.

""Relationships do not happen in a vacuum out of time and place,"" she explains. ""So many times, social and economic conditions we live in are reflected in these stories.""

I think people want to forget, but at the same time, they would like their story to be meaningful. - Olinka Vistica, co-founder of the Museum of Broken Relationships

One example: ""During the first exhibitions we had in Croatia and the countries of the ex-Yugoslavia, some stories reflected the consequences of war,"" she says. ""But someone in Singapore could understand what happened here during the war because of those stories. They were using the common language of loss of love."" A travelling exhibition that is appearing now in England draws a line between broken relationships and Brexit.

For the satellite shows, including the one coming to Toronto, Vištica and Grubišic lead the project, usually coordinating with curators at the venue. ""We want to feel the pulse of the city,"" she says. ""There's always this excitement: what are we going to get? And we are always surprised."" So, the character of Toronto's story has yet to be seen.

""The idea is very simple: the experience is very simple, but the true sharing that happens there is very unique,"" she says. ""To me, it still feels like magic.""

Check out a few of the international items that will be appearing at the Toronto exhibition.

Air sickness bags. 2004 - 2006. Zagreb, Croatia. ""A range of air sickness bags as a memento of a long-distance relationship. One Croatia Airlines, one Lufthansa, one Hapag Lloyd Express and three German Wings bags. I think I still have those illustrated safety instructions as well, ones showing what to do when the airplane begins to fall apart. I have never found any instructions on what to do when a relationship begins to fall apart, but at least I’ve still got these bags."" (Courtesy of the Harbourfront Museum)

A red wig. July 2007 - March 2008. New York, USA. ""Along with clothing and CDs I had left at her apartment, my ex-girlfriend sent me this wig I had never seen before, without a note. I can only assume it was obtained before our breakup, in preparation for a fantasy fulfilment."" (Courtesy of the Harbourfront Centre)

Lottery tickets. 63 years. Zaragoza, Spain. ""We were four friends. Four best friends for over 60 years. We shared everything. We did everything together: we celebrated birthdays, bought presents together, phoned each other every day, and visited each other when we were sick... One day, however, I discovered they had been doing something without telling me: they had been playing the lottery, the special Christmas one (it is a tradition in my country to buy a ticket together with your friends and/or family). How did I find out? Because they won a big prize. I felt so sad and disappointed when I found out that I fell ill. They didn’t know what to say when I asked them why they hadn’t told me; they only made excuses. The worst thing is that they never phoned me again. People told me they were too ashamed. Maybe. Only one of them contacted me again, sincerely apologized and came back into my life. But the other two... They won the prize, but they lost a real friend. Losing friends is hard when you are young but losing them when you are living the last years of your life is even harder."" (Courtesy of the Harbourfront Centre)

1190,,Cbc News,"The Ennis Sisters took to the stage on the shores of Juno Beach in Normandy, France, on Thursday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day and the Allied invasion of Europe.

""It was such an honour to be on that stage. It's been kind of an unbelievable experience since we've been invited to perform this song here today,"" Maureen Ennis told CBC Radio's On The Go roughly an hour after the Newfoundland and Labrador folk trio performed Sing You Home at the site of one of history's fiercest battles.

""To hear all the stories we've heard over the last couple of days and then have the opportunity to walk on the beach where, 75 years ago, D-Day happened — every step that we took on that beach we wondered what happened here. What is the history beneath our feet?""

The Ennis Sisters sang at the massive commemoration ceremony on Juno Beach 4:42

On June 6, 1944, some 14,000 Canadians landed at Juno Beach to join the more than 150,000 Allied troops to fight at the five beaches of Normandy that day.

Canadians stormed from the sea with the British on their left and right, attacking Sword Beach and Gold Beach, and the Americans attacking Omaha Beach and Utah Beach.

97-year-old Rod Deon was among those Canadians 75 years ago — and he was among the thousands who honoured those fighters in Normandy on Thursday.

Ennis said there was a lot of emotion running through the crowd of spectators.

""The veterans crying — it was such an overwhelming, emotional moment for us. I'm surprised that we were able to sing through it,"" Ennis said.

A memory close to the surface

As the soon as the final notes of Sing You Home rang out, Ennis said the group was whisked away to their dressing room without much time to fully grasp what they had just done.

""But then, as people were coming back here, we heard that our song went over very well, and at the same time people were talking about their experiences with World War II. It's just a very powerful moment to be on this beach today,"" she said.

""To stand on the beach and lookout over the English channel there, and just be in awe over what happened 75 years ago, there's no feeling like it.""

Maureen Ennis said it was a powerful experience. (CBC)

For the veterans of D-Day who had the opportunity to grow old, many more did not.

Ennis said memories of those harrowing days seems close to the surface for many of the veterans in the audience.

""As soon as any kind of emotional thing happened you could see the tears coming down the faces of the veterans sitting in the front,"" she said.

""It kind of took us back, once we got off stage and they're sitting right in the front, and you realize that these are the men that lived through that. It's incredible.""

A highlight of their career

It was either fate or destiny that the Ennis Sisters were asked to perform during the 75th commemoration of D-Day.

An organizer of the event had been driving through Ottawa and heard the group's song Sing You Home on CBC Radio in her car, Ennis said.

Overcome with emotion, the organizer pulled her vehicle over to listen closer. When she got home, she began researching the band, coming across a YouTube video for the song which sealed the deal.

""So they reached out to us and of course we accepted, without any hesitation at all,"" Ennis said.

""Honestly one of the highlights of our career, to this point, to be here today.""

There's a loss of control that often comes with illness — the feeling that your body has turned against itself or against you, or, at least, that it's something alien that you didn't know quite as well as you think you did.

Such was the case for Calgary-based artist Madeline Mackay, who faced down an autoimmune disorder a couple of years ago. As she describes, ""It changed the way I thought about a lot of things. This disease wasn't something from the outside invading my body: this was my body turning against itself. And that really changed the way that I perceived it.""

Turning to meat might seem like an unusual way to process the experience, but that's where Mackay ended up. Cutting them into thin strips, she uses pieces of meat as an almost painterly material against mud, invoking both the act of painting and performance.

And lest your stomach turn a little at the idea of watching an artist work with raw meat and flesh, it's worth considering what it's done not only for Mackay but also for her viewers.

The process of laying out the meat has been meditative, and working with the materials that make up all of our bodies has given the artist a new way to understand her relationship with her body and with her art. She explains, ""Part of what I try to do with my work is just bring us back to an awareness that, you know, our body's here; it's kind of unpredictable, kind of does weird things and sometimes there's nothing you can do about that. And I think for me, that's a really important awareness to get back to because I think it helps — it helped me, anyway, to build a healthier relationship with my body.""

1195,CBC Arts,Is Always Quite Terrified Of Bees.,"Warning: contains graphic imagery.

There's a loss of control that often comes with illness — the feeling that your body has turned against itself or against you, or, at least, that it's something alien that you didn't know quite as well as you think you did.

Such was the case for Calgary-based artist Madeline Mackay, who faced down an autoimmune disorder a couple of years ago. As she describes, ""It changed the way I thought about a lot of things. This disease wasn't something from the outside invading my body: this was my body turning against itself. And that really changed the way that I perceived it.""

Turning to meat might seem like an unusual way to process the experience, but that's where Mackay ended up. Cutting them into thin strips, she uses pieces of meat as an almost painterly material against mud, invoking both the act of painting and performance.

After an illness led Madeline Mackay to question the difference between her self and her body, she started working with meat to figure it out. Filmmakers: Laura O'Grady and Chris Krieger. 3:59

In this video by filmmakers Laura O'Grady and Chris Krieger, you see her creating a piece in her studio in a wading pool filled with mud. And lest your stomach turn a little at the idea of watching an artist work with raw meat and flesh, it's worth considering what it's done not only for Mackay but also for her viewers.

The process of laying out the meat has been meditative, and working with the materials that make up all of our bodies has given the artist a new way to understand her relationship with her body and with her art. She explains, ""Part of what I try to do with my work is just bring us back to an awareness that, you know, our body's here; it's kind of unpredictable, kind of does weird things and sometimes there's nothing you can do about that. And I think for me, that's a really important awareness to get back to because I think it helps — it helped me, anyway, to build a healthier relationship with my body.""

Comedians like Azhar Usman help us see the humour in this strange era we're in. He's a stand-up comic who's passionate about politics and world issues, but a few years back, he was standing at a crossroads in his career and almost quit comedy altogether.

Usman realized what he wanted to say and now he's found his way back to the stage. Ahead of his shows at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto this weekend, he joined q's Tom Power to talk about the comedy that inspires him, what drives him and what it's like travelling as a Muslim comedian.

You can check out Usman this Saturday at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, where he'll be performing two shows as a part of his series The Other Side of Fear.

Choreographer Michelle Olson on how her piece Gathering Light pays honour to the resilience of women and the transformations they go through. Filmmaker: Ulla Laidlaw 3:09

In this video made by filmmaker Ulla Laidlaw while Olson and her dancers were rehearsing in Toronto, Olson opens up about what drove her to create Gathering Light. A pregnancy loss and her resulting sense of community with other women inspired her to look at the places where women go through transformations that they don't share or aren't celebrated. Gathering Light has become, for her, a sort of ceremony that is both a celebration of women and an offering to them.

See Michelle Olson as part of Matriarchs Uprising at Scotiabank Dance Centre in Vancouver, June 20-22.

TRUST PROJECT

CBC News is a member of the Trust Project, an international consortium of news organizations collaborating to use transparency as a way to educate readers and promote news that lives up to fairness and accuracy.

The Trust Project is developing tools that help users differentiate high-quality news online. A system of 'trust Indicators' are designed to tell audiences and news distribution platforms that the editorial is ethically produced, accurate news.

LABELLING CONTENT

CBC News uses labels as signals to help readers identify the status of different kinds of stories. Labels are used to flag stories that are breaking news or contain live elements such as video.

CBC News also uses labels to distinguish clearly between analysis and opinion.

Analysis — Here, reporters may make observations and draw conclusions based on facts as well as their own experience and expertise.

Opinion — On an exceptional basis, we may choose to appoint certain journalists as columnists. They have licence to express their opinions. To protect the integrity of CBC's journalism, we will restrict the role of such columnists to opinion and commentary. Their work will be clearly identified as opinion.

When presenting content where a single opinion or point of view is featured, we ensure that a diversity of perspective is provided across a network or platform and in an appropriate time frame.

1405,,Senior Writer,"House prices may be as high as ever in many parts of the country, but Canadian homebuyers are being offered some of the lowest mortgage rates seen in years as lenders battle to drum up new business.

Rates on a standard five-year fixed-rate mortgage have fallen to their lowest level in two years, according to rate comparison website, Ratehub.ca.

Borrowers just about everywhere across the country can take their pick of offerings well below three per cent at the moment, says James Laird, the site's co-founder and president of mortgage brokerage, CanWise Financial.

That's partly for seasonal reasons, he says, in that the spring months are typically the best ones for home buying, as families try to get moved and settled before summer vacations and then the new school year sets in.

""Promotions are April, May and June … when all mortgage companies try to make sure they are on track to hit their annual targets,"" Laird said in an interview. ""Anyone who's behind at this point would be aggressive with the margins they're willing to fund mortgages at right now.""

At the moment, Laird says he's seeing five-year fixed rates as low as 2.64 per cent for certain buyers, and even higher-risk borrowers can easily find a loan for 2.89 per cent. That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.

Unlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate and make money on that spread.

So current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.

""The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,"" Laird said. ""And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.""

Less popular loans

Variable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.

Most borrowers prefer the peace of mind of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates — even if they're only temporary.

Laird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.

He says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.

Anyone signing up for that loan today is ""assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,"" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.

Trading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank this year — but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.

Lower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.

1 in 6 mortgages up for renewal

A recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)

But thanks to the steep slide in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.

""With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,"" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau said.

Laird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.

Housing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.

But until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly: ""Pretty cheap money.""",,"['bank', 'cent', 'loan', 'lenders', 'rate', 'money', 'mortgage', 'loans', 'point', 'rates']",,http://www.cbc.ca

""The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,"" Laird said. ""And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.""

Less popular loans

Variable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.

Most borrowers prefer the peace of mind of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates — even if they're only temporary.

Laird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.

He says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.

Anyone signing up for that loan today is ""assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,"" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.

Trading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank this year — but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.

Lower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.

1 in 6 mortgages up for renewal

A recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)

But thanks to the steep slide in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.

""With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,"" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau said.

Laird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.

Housing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.

But until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly: ""Pretty cheap money.""",,"['bank', 'cent', 'loan', 'lenders', 'rate', 'money', 'mortgage', 'loans', 'point', 'rates']",,http://www.cbc.ca
1409,,The Toronto Star,"House prices may be as high as ever in many parts of the country, but Canadian homebuyers are being offered some of the lowest mortgage rates seen in years as lenders battle to drum up new business.

Rates on a standard five-year fixed-rate mortgage have fallen to their lowest level in two years, according to rate comparison website, Ratehub.ca.

Borrowers just about everywhere across the country can take their pick of offerings well below three per cent at the moment, says James Laird, the site's co-founder and president of mortgage brokerage, CanWise Financial.

That's partly for seasonal reasons, he says, in that the spring months are typically the best ones for home buying, as families try to get moved and settled before summer vacations and then the new school year sets in.

""Promotions are April, May and June … when all mortgage companies try to make sure they are on track to hit their annual targets,"" Laird said in an interview. ""Anyone who's behind at this point would be aggressive with the margins they're willing to fund mortgages at right now.""

At the moment, Laird says he's seeing five-year fixed rates as low as 2.64 per cent for certain buyers, and even higher-risk borrowers can easily find a loan for 2.89 per cent. That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.

Unlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate and make money on that spread.

1415,,Politics,"A year ago, Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives secured a decisive victory in Ontario's provincial election. In the process, they laid out a roadmap for Andrew Scheer's Conservatives to follow in this year's federal election: win the same parts of Ontario that Ford did and watch Prime Minister Justin Trudeau go the way of former premier Kathleen Wynne.

But ""Ford Nation"" is not the towering electoral coalition it's sometimes made out to be. Even if Scheer wins every Ontario vote in October that Ford won last year, that alone wouldn't be enough to defeat the Trudeau Liberals.

He'd need a little help. Luckily for him, the Liberals are providing it — for now.

In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals won 80 seats in Ontario. In the 2018 provincial election, the Ontario PCs won 76 seats.

With the exception of ridings in northern Ontario, the electoral map in the province is identical at both levels of government.

In southern Ontario, 42 ridings elected both Liberal MPs in 2015 and PC MPPs in 2018. They're predominantly located in the Greater Toronto Area, with 11 in Toronto itself and another 21 in the surrounding 905 area code. Three ridings in the northern part of the province with largely similar electoral boundaries also split between Trudeau in one election and Ford in the next.

If Scheer is able to flip these 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings in October's election, that alone would be enough to deprive the prime minister of another majority government and (at the least) put Scheer in the driver's seat in a minority Parliament.

But despite Ford's commanding victory last year — the most seats won by any Ontario party since Mike Harris in 1995 — his vote tally was remarkably similar to the score Stephen Harper put up in his losing 2015 campaign.

The Harper Conservatives received the support of 2,293,393 Ontarians in 2015. Three years later, the Ontario PCs earned 2,326,523 votes, or about 1.4 per cent more than the federal Conservatives did — far less than the rate of growth in the province's population over that time.

In the Trudeau-Ford ridings, the Ontario PCs captured about 29,000 more votes than the Harper Conservatives did in 2015 — averaging just 638 more votes per riding than Harper won. There is a clear relationship between the performance of the PCs in each of these ridings and the performance of the federal Conservatives three years earlier, suggesting that this is largely the same pool of voters.

That pool was only big enough to win the Conservatives 33 seats in 2015. In only four of these Trudeau-Ford ridings did the Ontario PCs win more votes in the provincial election than the Trudeau Liberals did in the federal election.

In other words, if the Liberal vote holds and Scheer manages to get every Ontario PC supporter to cast a ballot for his party in October, he gains only four of these Trudeau-Ford seats (and polls suggest the ranks of Ontario PC supporters are thinner today than they once were).

The winning Ford vote in 2018 is very much like the losing Harper vote in 2015. If Scheer can't improve upon those results, he needs the Liberals to fall back.

Liberal drop, not 'Ford Nation', key to Scheer win in Ontario

Turnout in the federal election in 2015 was far higher in Ontario (67.8 per cent) than it was in the provincial election in 2018 (56.7 per cent). The Trudeau Liberals also received many more votes than the Ontario Liberals did.

That's why the roadmap provided by the Ontario PCs is not one that can win an election for Scheer on its own. The federal Liberals would need to lose about 280,000 votes across the Trudeau-Ford ridings for Liberal candidates to receive fewer votes than the winning PC candidates did in 2018. That represents about a quarter of the votes Trudeau's party got in those ridings four years ago.

The good news for Scheer is that — according to the CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data — that's what has happened to the Liberals in Ontario. With 34.3 per cent support in the province, the Liberals have lost about 11 points from their performance in the 2015 federal election, or just under one in every four votes they received.

But at 35.2 per cent, the Conservatives are no further ahead today in Ontario than they were in 2015. With these levels of support, any win in a Trudeau-Ford riding by Scheer would be due to the drop in the Liberal vote, rather than any increase in the Conservative vote.

Scheer needs Liberals to go elsewhere or stay home

Two factors contributed to Ford's victory in 2018. One was the bleeding of Liberal support to Andrea Horwath's New Democrats. The other was a lot of Liberals staying home on election day.

Though we can't know for certain how (or if) Ontarians who supported Trudeau in 2015 voted in the 2018 election, the numbers are stark. In the 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings alone, the Ontario Liberals received nearly 700,000 fewer votes than the federal Liberals did.

The Ontario New Democrats under leader Andrea Horwath were the primary beneficiaries of a drop in Liberal support in 2018. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)

The Ontario New Democrats were the biggest beneficiaries, as they received about 300,000 more votes than their federal cousins did in the province. The Ontario Greens and PCs, however, did just about as well as the federal parties who fly the same colours.

This means that perhaps as many as half of the voters who supported the Trudeau Liberals in 2015 in these key swing ridings stayed home in 2018 rather than cast a ballot for the Wynne Liberals.

Still, the parts of the province that supported Ford in last year's election are the same areas that helped give Harper his majority government in 2011. The Conservatives will be looking to the same bits of Ontario to help them win in October.

But Scheer will need to follow a narrow path if he wants to win the same way that Ford did — a path that banks on a big chunk of the Liberal vote staying home, or showing up only to support other parties. The polls suggest the Liberals are vulnerable — but also that they might be at their lowest ebb. Scheer can't count on things staying this way as the election date approaches.

His chances would improve if he instead grows the Conservative tent in Ontario, since without a split on the centre-left or a disengaged electorate, there just aren't enough Ford backers in the province to win Scheer a federal election.",,"['liberals', 'votes', 'ford', 'scheer', 'federal', 'ontario', '2015', 'win', 'ridings', 'election']",,http://www.cbc.ca

If Scheer is able to flip these 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings in October's election, that alone would be enough to deprive the prime minister of another majority government and (at the least) put Scheer in the driver's seat in a minority Parliament.

But despite Ford's commanding victory last year — the most seats won by any Ontario party since Mike Harris in 1995 — his vote tally was remarkably similar to the score Stephen Harper put up in his losing 2015 campaign.

The Harper Conservatives received the support of 2,293,393 Ontarians in 2015. Three years later, the Ontario PCs earned 2,326,523 votes, or about 1.4 per cent more than the federal Conservatives did — far less than the rate of growth in the province's population over that time.

In the Trudeau-Ford ridings, the Ontario PCs captured about 29,000 more votes than the Harper Conservatives did in 2015 — averaging just 638 more votes per riding than Harper won. There is a clear relationship between the performance of the PCs in each of these ridings and the performance of the federal Conservatives three years earlier, suggesting that this is largely the same pool of voters.

That pool was only big enough to win the Conservatives 33 seats in 2015. In only four of these Trudeau-Ford ridings did the Ontario PCs win more votes in the provincial election than the Trudeau Liberals did in the federal election.

In other words, if the Liberal vote holds and Scheer manages to get every Ontario PC supporter to cast a ballot for his party in October, he gains only four of these Trudeau-Ford seats (and polls suggest the ranks of Ontario PC supporters are thinner today than they once were).

The winning Ford vote in 2018 is very much like the losing Harper vote in 2015. If Scheer can't improve upon those results, he needs the Liberals to fall back.

Liberal drop, not 'Ford Nation', key to Scheer win in Ontario

Turnout in the federal election in 2015 was far higher in Ontario (67.8 per cent) than it was in the provincial election in 2018 (56.7 per cent). The Trudeau Liberals also received many more votes than the Ontario Liberals did.

That's why the roadmap provided by the Ontario PCs is not one that can win an election for Scheer on its own. The federal Liberals would need to lose about 280,000 votes across the Trudeau-Ford ridings for Liberal candidates to receive fewer votes than the winning PC candidates did in 2018. That represents about a quarter of the votes Trudeau's party got in those ridings four years ago.

The good news for Scheer is that — according to the CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data — that's what has happened to the Liberals in Ontario. With 34.3 per cent support in the province, the Liberals have lost about 11 points from their performance in the 2015 federal election, or just under one in every four votes they received.

But at 35.2 per cent, the Conservatives are no further ahead today in Ontario than they were in 2015. With these levels of support, any win in a Trudeau-Ford riding by Scheer would be due to the drop in the Liberal vote, rather than any increase in the Conservative vote.

Scheer needs Liberals to go elsewhere or stay home

Two factors contributed to Ford's victory in 2018. One was the bleeding of Liberal support to Andrea Horwath's New Democrats. The other was a lot of Liberals staying home on election day.

Though we can't know for certain how (or if) Ontarians who supported Trudeau in 2015 voted in the 2018 election, the numbers are stark. In the 45 Trudeau-Ford ridings alone, the Ontario Liberals received nearly 700,000 fewer votes than the federal Liberals did.

The Ontario New Democrats under leader Andrea Horwath were the primary beneficiaries of a drop in Liberal support in 2018. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)

The Ontario New Democrats were the biggest beneficiaries, as they received about 300,000 more votes than their federal cousins did in the province. The Ontario Greens and PCs, however, did just about as well as the federal parties who fly the same colours.

This means that perhaps as many as half of the voters who supported the Trudeau Liberals in 2015 in these key swing ridings stayed home in 2018 rather than cast a ballot for the Wynne Liberals.

Still, the parts of the province that supported Ford in last year's election are the same areas that helped give Harper his majority government in 2011. The Conservatives will be looking to the same bits of Ontario to help them win in October.

But Scheer will need to follow a narrow path if he wants to win the same way that Ford did — a path that banks on a big chunk of the Liberal vote staying home, or showing up only to support other parties. The polls suggest the Liberals are vulnerable — but also that they might be at their lowest ebb. Scheer can't count on things staying this way as the election date approaches.

His chances would improve if he instead grows the Conservative tent in Ontario, since without a split on the centre-left or a disengaged electorate, there just aren't enough Ford backers in the province to win Scheer a federal election.",,"['liberals', 'votes', 'ford', 'scheer', 'federal', 'ontario', '2015', 'win', 'ridings', 'election']",,http://www.cbc.ca

In Gatineau, the smell from a Hexo plant has become so intolerable that Virginie Roussin no longer hangs her laundry out to dry or leaves her windows open.

""Last Sunday we opened a bit of my son's room [window] and we closed the door. Afterward when we came back at night, it was like we smoked a joint in the room,"" she said.

CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning reached out to some municipalities west of Ottawa also dealing with the same problem.

'Somebody has to step up'

Rich Coleman, the MLA for Langley East in B.C., said there are four cannabis facilities causing a big stink in two communities.

""It is actually very bad. I have one family where the wife ... leaves the home up to four times a week to go stay with a relative because of the migraine headaches that the odour is bringing forward,"" he said.

""Somebody has to step up and either shut these places down or make them get their act together, because if they're allowed to just go on and not be enforced, it will continue to be a large problem.""

Langley East MLA Rich Coleman says someone needs to step up to enforce the law that cannabis producers must control their odours. (CBC)

Coleman said the company involved isn't tackling the problem with proper air filtration, but is instead trying to mask the odour with a sweet smell.

""Basically what they're doing is they're putting Febreeze-smelling-type oil through these cannons to try and mitigate the smell, which just makes it a sweeter stink. It doesn't change anything,"" he said.

He's written to the federal attorney general and the health minister to try to get the odour control law enforced.

'Getting better'

In Pelham, Ont., which sits in the Niagara Region, Mayor Marvin Junkin said there are two big cannabis operations that have been generating complaints, but that the situation is slowly improving.

""I would actually say in the last six months they have both tried to become good corporate citizens, and they are slowly but surely investing more money into their exhaust system. So it is actually getting better here,"" he said.

Masson-Angers residents living near a cannabis company there aren't the only ones fed up with the stink of cannabis cultivation centres. We hear why political rep's for both Langley, B.C. and Pelham, Ontario think the federal government should be doing more. 10:23

In October 2018, the municipality passed a bylaw forbidding any new cannabis grow-ops from setting up for a year, in order to allow municipal staff to study what's being done elsewhere and come up with adequate bylaws.

1426,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"The two times Harry Read has leapt out of a plane over the fields of Normandy in France couldn't be more different.

The first time, he was 20 years old, parachuting out of a transport aircraft under cover of dark as a part of the British 6th Airborne Division in the early hours of June 6, 1944.

The second time — three quarters of a century later during the 75th anniversary of D-Day — he performed a tandem skydiving jump with a member of the British Army's Parachute Display Team for ""sheer pleasure.""

""It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. I really have to express it in the most most warm words. It was a delight,"" Read, 95, told As It Happens host Carol Off on Thursday, the day after his dramatic leap.

Read was one of several Second World War veterans in their 90s who made the jump as part of the commemoration of the Normandy landings, the beginning of the Allied liberation of Nazi-occupied France.

Dressed in red jumpsuits, 95-year-old Harry Read and 94-year-old John (Jock) Hutton performed tandem jumps with the British Army's Parachute Display to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, France. 3:32

""Comparing the two is not a very good comparison, because 75 years ago we were going into action,"" Read said.

Back then, Read was among more than 8,000 soldiers tasked with protecting the Allied left flank from counter-attack as the biggest seaborne invasion in history landed ashore in northern France.

It was a crucial battle that paved the way for the eventual Allied victory — and Read knew going in that his odds of surviving were slim at best.

""We were in a war against a world that was increasingly evil,"" he said. ""Our very future was at stake. The war had to be fought. It was a sheer necessity for us to do so.""

When he jumped that first time — in the dead of night with a toolbox-sized battery strapped to his leg — Read landed ""on time, but in the wrong place.""

""The Germans, in their military wisdom, had flooded a massive area diverting a river into land that was already subject to normal overflows,"" he said.

That's where Read — and many of his brothers in arms — landed. Many men drowned in those flooded fields.

""I landed, took the battery off my leg and put my gun together and looked around to see who was ready to kill me — and lo and behold, no one was there to do that,"" Read said.

""But getting out of the flooded area was not easy and took, in effect, 16 hours.""

The lucky few

He and a fellow paratrooper were able to make it to a nearby farmhouse, where a French family was housing several other members of the Allied forces.

A local priest, who was part of the resistance, helped them connect with more of their fellow soldiers on the other side of the village.

""Because of the priest's success as a go-between, we were able to get together as a group and then make our way through the enemy lines to get to where we were supposed to be,"" he said.

Read comes in for a landing after an 'absolutely brilliant' jump. (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)

Not everyone was so lucky. More than 10,000 members of the Allied forces are estimated to have died on D-Day, as well as thousands of Germans.

That's why returning to Normandy and commemorating their sacrifice is so important to Read.

""We're proud of the record we have of pulling a victory out of an almost impossible situation. It is a great history, though brief, that regiments like ours have,"" he said.

""But we lost a lot of friends and I tend to be very emotional here. I stand in the cemetery and find that I can hardly speak — and I weep.""

But there is one thing that Read's two jumps have in common. In both cases, Read says, he's lucky to have made it.

""Anyone, I would think, over the age of 65 who would contemplate a skydive ... has got to be thinking unwisely,"" he said with a chuckle.

""Which shows one or two things [about me], doesn't it?""

1427,,Cbc News,"A treasure hunt that sent Calgarians scurrying around the city in search of a reported $100,000 prize has come to an end.

The treasure, hidden by a company called Gold Hunt, was found by Edmontonian Jeff Lerue, who has been off work due to a disability for two years, waiting for a knee replacement

""This couldn't have come at a better time for me,"" said Lerue in a news release. ""I was just denied AISH.""

The company behind the hunt buried gold and silver pieces it valued at $100,000 and charged would-be treasure hunters $25 for a map with clues or $45 for a package that included five additional clues.

""It still doesn't feel real,"" Lerue said during a news conference on Wednesday.

Edmonton hunt over quickly

Lerue said after he heard Edmonton's treasure was found within 20 hours of the start of the contest on Saturday, he decided to buy a map for Calgary's hunt.

He doesn't know Calgary that well, so on Monday, he and his girlfriend spent hours puzzling through the clues and poring over Google Maps.

Then on Tuesday, once they had an idea of where to start, they drove down to Calgary.

""We scoured until pretty much dark last night,"" he said.

""Some of the clues kind of jumped out at us.""

Lerue noticed a ton of people searching in one neighbourhood, but there was one secluded area they were passing by.

""So I thought, it's just odd that people aren't going there … and sure enough that's where it was.""

The Calgary location where the Gold Hunt treasure was found will stay secret until the Vancouver hunt has been completed. (CBC)

Lerue has promised not to reveal where he found the prize until Vancouver's hunt wraps up, as to not give any hints as to how the clues work, but he said when he found the prize in its hiding spot he was over the moon.

""I freaked out … I dropped the box and was like, 'oh my god,'"" he said, adding that the box contained instructions to claim the prize.

""I was like, let's go, let's go. We beelined to our truck and just took off.""

Lerue said he plans to use the money to pay bills and debt he's accrued while being off work, and take his girlfriend on a much-deserved vacation.

Some hiccups in inaugural treasure hunt

Chris Cromwell, Gold Hunt's spokesperson, said the inaugural scavenger hunts were a big learning experience — and that the company hopes to roll it out nationwide.

""This is our first run,"" he said.

""We've done our best to host a safe, fun, exciting and romantic treasure hunt.""

There were some hiccups, with members of the hunt disregarding the game's rules by digging up flower beds and rifling through private property.

""Obviously, it's not our intention to create anything that's going to damage public or private property,"" Cromwell said.

""We've done our best, I think, to make sure people are doing the right thing.""

While the treasure has been found, one thing will stay secret for now — the identity of the Gold Hunt team.

Cromwell said the group of friends, who are entrepreneurs and private investors, came up with the idea of the hunt just 60 days ago, and that they intend to stay anonymous for now.",,"['lerue', 'clues', 'company', 'private', 'gold', 'prize', 'stay', 'treasure', 'work', 'hunt']",,http://www.cbc.ca

Sitting in a hospital in Nova Scotia, Ferne Selig said she was ready to die.

""I've had a good life, and I mean this very sincerely, I could go, I could go anytime,"" she told David Maginley, a chaplain at a hospital in Halifax.

""After our last conversation, I'm quite looking forward to it, to be honest with you,"" Selig said.

Selig had been living with cancer for 14 months. In her working life, the 65-year-old had been a master Mary Kay beauty consultant, who earned the enviable pink Cadillac for her sales.

Maginley had been talking with her for some time, in his role at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax. The Current accompanied him on his visit with Selig.

Selig's only experience of dying was with her mother, who died of cancer in 2015. Now she found herself in the same position, as she felt her own death drawing near.

""I was so sure she was coming last night, David. I'd have bet my house that my mother was gonna take me last night,"" she said.

As she spoke, Selig became overwhelmed with emotion, and Maginley helped her to understand what she was feeling.

He told her the emotion was the ""awareness of death: it's grief, it's anticipation, and it took over your body, your breath.""

""You were washed by it, submerged in it. And all we want to do is not suppress it, we want to breathe into it, and discover that we're actually floating, not drowning.""

Maginley talks with a patient in Halifax. This patient did not receive a terminal diagnosis, but Maginley has counselled hundreds who have. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)

As Selig began to feel better, they joked together that this was ""a good rehearsal.""

""This is what makes dying so overwhelming,"" Maginley said. ""We prepare to say goodbye to you. It's heartbreaking.

""But you prepare to say goodbye to reality. And every love you've ever known. The scale of that is too much.""

Unfortunately, he said, ""to do that well involves this surrender, and giving yourself to the experience.""

Selig died shortly after the visit in April.

Speaking to The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti this week, Maginley said that emotions like Selig's are common in a person's final days.

""Our mind is trying to cope, but our body tells us the truth about our emotions,"" he said.

""She rode the wave and it brought her back to herself. She felt empty. She felt peaceful. She discovered that she floats.""

Part of dying well is understanding what happens to your own ego, David Maginley tells Anna Maria Tremonti. 1:02

The unfinished love stories

Maginley has been supporting cancer patients for almost 20 years.

A four-time cancer survivor himself, he published his book Beyond Surviving: Cancer and Your Spiritual Journey in 2017.

He said that what people fear most is ""not the dying, it's the leaving.""

""It's leaving your loved ones, the not being part of their stories,"" he told Tremonti.

Culturally we have a massive aversion to death, seeing it as a failure that must be prevented at all costs, he said.

""It becomes something we strive against with every aspect of our being, subconsciously. But it's inevitable homework for everyone.""

It's the words we did not say … affirming love, or the words we did that just pushed love away. - David Maginley

That homework is about forgiving the past and having a sense of humour about your own failings and shortfalls.

He told Tremonti about a woman named Liz, who had been sexually abused by her father a child. When she pressed charges as an adult, he was jailed.

Years later, after Liz received a terminal diagnosis, her father turned up at her door.

Liz told Maginley that her father ""came in, and he stood so awkwardly and afraid in front of me.""

""I felt my heart filled with peace and forgiveness for this man. I had worked through my pain and I wasn't going to be carrying it,"" Liz said. She got off her bed, hugged her father, and they talked.

You don't have to be religious to find peace in the dying process, David Maginley tells Anna Maria Tremonti. 0:41

Maginley said that Liz died well, because she had done her homework.

""She had realized that to forgive is to set yourself free from the pain you've been carrying. It has no bearing upon what the other person has said, feels, thinks or does.""

Maginley's book tells of his personal and professional transformation through cancer.

Having 'open-hearted conversations'

If you do have a serious diagnosis, Maginley thinks it's important to have those conversations about palliative care early, even while you're still fighting for life.

""Those open-hearted conversations, I recognize, are profoundly difficult, but so empowering when everybody feels onboard, and you're able to make good choices.""

He said that from sitting with the dying, he's seen that regrets are never about finances or career accomplishments, but always relationships.

""It's the words we did not say … affirming love, or the words we did that just pushed love away,"" he said.

""I think most of us leave this world with broken bits and unfinished business.""

When former Jehovah's Witness Amber Scorah began to have doubts about her faith, she kept them private, even from her husband.

Until one night, she couldn't contain her questions anymore.

Scorah and her husband were reading about a new trend in the Jehovah's Witness community: learning Hebrew and Greek to study the bible in its original language.

""[That] seemed like a really great idea to me ... because I thought, like, what would we be afraid of?"" Scorah told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

However the article went on to condemn the trend, and said ""that the only place that we should be getting our understanding from was from what we called the governing body, who are essentially the leaders of the Jehovah's Witnesses.""

Scorah suddenly blurted out: ""Is this some kind of a cult or something?""

""My husband looked at me and was like, 'what did you just say?'

Scorah says that exclamation was a step in leaving her faith, being shunned by many of the people in her life, and trying to find her own way in the world. Originally from Vancouver, she now works as a writer and editor in New York, and has documented experience in Leaving The Witness: Exiting a Religion and Finding a Life.

Scorah has written about losing her faith in her new book Leaving The Witness: Exiting a Religion and Finding a Life. (Penguin Random House)

'The worst sin you can commit'

Scorah was a third-generation Jehovah's Witness. As her beliefs dictated, she had not gone to college and had only ever worked part time, to devote her time instead to trying to convert people to her faith.

Like others in her religion, Scorah believed that the apocalypse was imminent, and that at the end of the world, only those who devote themselves to the Jehovah's Witness faith would be saved.

""When you have that mentality, if you think you're a person who cares about people, you just want to try and save people's lives,"" she said.

But as the years went by, she began to doubt the absolute truth of her faith. However, she didn't dare tell anyone.

""It's a very dangerous thing to admit that you have doubts about the faith, because in our religion that's basically the worst sin you can commit,"" she said.

If a Jehovah's Witness does something that goes against the core rules of the church, they are asked to confess to a panel of elders, who then decide if they are repentant enough.

If they are deemed not to be, the church member can be ""disfellowshipped,"" meaning other members of the congregation will no longer speak to them, or even acknowledge them if they pass them on the street.

Scorah first revealed her doubts to her former husband while discussing an article about the bible. (Corey Perrine/Naples Daily News via Associated Press)

When Scorah's congregation found out about her doubts — through one of her Bible students — she was shunned, though not officially disfellowshipped.

""I was told that if I talk about this stuff, I will be disfellowshipped,"" she told Tremonti. ""In fact, they just told me to stay away ... if I wasn't willing to reform my thoughts back to where they should be.""

The Current requested interviews with the Jehovah's Witnesses International Organization, as well as its Canadian branch. Both declined, directing us to their website, which describes disfellowshipping as ""a loving provision.""

""Disfellowshipping may bring the wrongdoer to his senses,"" the site says, adding that it also ""protects the clean, Christian congregation.""

The website also addresses the question of whether the Jehovah's Witnesses are a cult, saying, in part, ""Far from being a dangerous cult, Jehovah's Witnesses practice a religion that benefits its members and others in the community.""

Scorah said that the word cult is ""very charged,"" but thinks she received ""retribution"" for what she calls a ""very moderate doubt.""

""It wasn't like I was ranting and raving in the congregation,"" she said. ""The reaction I got did not feel right, did not feel normal.""

Scorah was living in China when she left the church, and lost contact with a lot of the people in her life.

""I just didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. I didn't know how to live in the real world because I had been taught that that world was scary,"" she said.

Scorah now lives in New York. Building her new life has made every day more meaningful, she said. (Lucas Jackson)

Leaving showed her 'life is actually very beautiful'

Scorah left the church, and lost contact with her now former husband. She ended up living and working in the U.S.

Building a new life for herself was a long, lonely and difficult process, she said.

""I had to become outgoing even though I'm kind of a shy person, and just make friends, one at a time.

""Figure out how I would support myself, where I was going to live, it was basically just like starting a new life.""

She doesn't regret her decision, and said she would encourage former friends to ask questions about their beliefs, though the decision on whether to stay in the religion is up to them.

For her, leaving the certainties of her religion has given her a new take on life.

""Life is actually very beautiful,"" she told Tremonti.

""And when you realize it's not going to go on forever, even the day-to-day becomes more meaningful.""

1431,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"In only a little more than a year, Netflix's hit show Queer Eye has become a global phenomenon, making the stars of the show, aka the ""Fab Five"" — Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski, Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness and Tan France — into household names.

France is Queer Eye's fashion expert and while viewers normally see him getting to know the lives of the people he helps on TV, in his recently released memoir, Naturally Tan, he invites fans to learn more about his story.

""I hadn't thought about life as a kid when I was younger at all,"" France told q's Tom Power about his memoir that touches on Queer Eye, but also confronts some persistent and painful experiences from France's childhood and adolescence, which he admits he didn't always recognize at the time.

""If anybody ever asks me now, 'did you suffer bullying as a kid?' My answer was no and still is no. But it was shocking that only 30-something years ago, I was constantly taunted for being brown, being Pakistani, being a different colour, practising a certain religion at the time. ... Now, as I'm older, I realize how incredibly ludicrous that is.""

I felt the weight of [being different] very early on, thinking, I'm going to have to try and find a way to hide this. - Queer Eye's Tan France

France said that writing the memoir forced him to challenge his own perceptions of what life was like growing up gay, Muslim and Pakistani in South Yorkshire, England. He and his family faced racism and he learned to hide his sexuality at an early age.

""I lived in a very traditional South Asian community and being different is definitely something that's discouraged,"" said France. ""I felt the weight of [being different] very early on, thinking, I'm going to have to try and find a way to hide this because my differences are definitely not what make me special here and will not be well-received.""

Fashion was something that France says he was always interested in because it was an outlet for him to express himself, have fun and experiment.

""I loved my community, but it was a community that was so stifling when I look back on it, that the only way I could really express myself was through my clothes. I wasn't allowed to say what I was, who I was, the differences that I had inside me, but I was able to experiment with clothes, at least in the home.""

In his memoir, France recounts how his interests in music, movies and pop culture helped him further develop his identity and his sense of self. Watching Dirty Dancing for the first time led to a lifelong ""obsession"" with the film because it taught him that it was okay to love someone who others didn't approve of.

""It was just this dream that you could fall in love with somebody and even though you're going against the grain, even though you're doing something that your family would never approve of, you get to live a life that you truly want to live,"" said France.

""It was the ultimate dream for me. Did I imagine I would be with Patrick Swayze and not Baby? Yeah. 100 per cent. Who didn't at the time?""

1432,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"""For me, it was like listening to women talking back to me from a hundred years ago,"" says Safaneh Mohaghegh Neyshabouri.

As she read the journals, she discovered just how different these people were from the stereotype of women from that time, known as the Qajar era.

""The general understanding of Qajar women's role is that they were absent from the public, that they were prisoners inside their homes, and their only job was to satisfy men's desire, and produce and raise kids,"" says Neyshabouri, who is finishing her PhD at the University of Alberta.

""My investigation into their daily lives shows ways that they're resisting and circumventing patriarchy,"" she adds.

""These women are perfectly well aware of how to use the spaces that are available to them to express themselves, share their experiences, and to resist coercive power in a way that was least costly to themselves.""

One of the diaries she examines was written by Aliyeh Khanoum Shirazi. The handwritten text entered the archives at the University of Tehran in 2007, and Neyshabouri is the first scholar to analyze it.

Safaneh Mohaghegh Neyshabouri is finishing her PhD at the University of Alberta. (Submitted by Safaneh Mohaghegh Neyshabouri.)

In 1892, Aliyeh Shirazi left her husband and kids to do the Hajj pilgrimage. Her travel journal spans two years as she travelled to India, Jeddah, Mecca, and Tehran (where she spent more than a year).

In her journal, Aliyeh carefully critiques the men she encounters. One of these men was the most powerful man in Iran, Nasser al-din Shah. The Shah had 84 wives.

""Aliyeh's account of Nasser al-din Shah's court is one of the two accounts that we have by women,"" says Neyshabouri. ""Aliyeh's vantage point is closer to the regular people. So she describes these details and this is, to my knowledge, the only record we have of the routine of the Shah.""

In 1893, Aliyeh Shirazi spent time at the Shah's palace in Tehran, helping his 84 wives, and writing down her own observations of the daily and nightly rituals. 1:34

While Aliyeh cannot explicitly protest the king's extravagances because she would fear repercussions if the journal fell into the wrong hands, Neyshabouri notes that Aliyeh goes as close to the line as she can with her critique.

""She does not want to directly mock the king and his behaviour, but she does that between the lines, by describing things, by describing the way he acts towards women,"" she says. ""She basically makes fun of him or questions his behaviour.""

Neyshabouri's work adds to a growing trove bringing women's voices into recorded history.

'Where are the women in your history?'

Harvard University professor Afsaneh Najambadi is a driving force behind a massive online archive of documents, photographs, and recordings of women's lives in the late 19th century and early 20th century Iran.

""For the longest time, histories of Qajar period were focused on, and largely about, men of the period,"" says Najambadi.

""Normally, when you would ask historians, 'Where are the women in your history?', the response was that there are no sources. But, as it turns out, actually there are plenty of sources.""

Neyshabouri likens the writing of the women from the 19th century to how women in Iran today are using social media to resist authority in subtle ways.

Just as women in the late 19th century used handwriting to make observations and quietly protest injustices, Safaneh says, women today continue to technologies and 'spaces' available to them.

""Every act of resistance is important,"" says Neyshabouri. ""It is never useless to resist injustice. We should use whatever possibilities we have to speak truth to power.""

In fact, so pervasive is the genre that it has come to be known as cli-fi.

The Drowned World, by J.G. Ballard

The Drowned World, written in 1962, has influenced many climate-fiction writers. ((Arizona O'Neill))

The Drowned World, written in 1962, is considered one of the founding texts of climate fiction. It was a novel ahead of its time that has influenced many writers since.

It takes place in the year 2145 in a post-apocalyptic London where the city is completely flooded and has turned into a tropical swamp. Everyone has fled the city, but we follow a team of scientists who are studying the new world that is now overrun by wildlife.

One of the most striking images in the book is of the giant lizards that now occupy the new lagoon threatening human life. The scientists work on the top of buildings that peak out over the watery streets.

It is interesting to read a text about global warming from the 1960s that does not have all the facts we do today about the scary outcome we might all face. We read this speculative text very differently in the 21st century and I suggest giving this eerie book a read.

New York 2140, by Kim Stanley Robinson

In New York 2140, the city is flooded. It’s a nod to J.G. Ballard’s classic The Drowned World. ((Arizona O’Neill))

This novel follows many characters in New York City who live in an apartment building in Madison Square that is flooded by 50 feet of water. Each skyscraper has become an island with glass walking tubes interconnecting them.

The city has continued to build upwards to create more living spaces, and certain poorer people live illegally on boats that float through the streets below. It is clear from the title that Kim Stanley Robinson, who was named a 'Hero of the Environment' by Time Magazine, is referencing J.G. Ballard's classic The Drowned World.

Both books take place in nearly the same year, 2140, and the major cities near water have flooded. The book's cover copy, in a direct nod to Ballard, states, ""New York in the year 2140 is far from a drowned city.""

There is a reference to Ballard in the book as well: ""Scientists published their papers, and shouted and waved their arms, and a few canny and deeply thoughtful sci-fi writers wrote up lurid accounts of such an eventuality, and the rest of civilization went in torching the planet like a Burning Man pyromasterpiece.""

Robinson, however, has a different take Ballard's watery future, and I would venture to say a more realistic one. Robinson paints a vision of the future where New Yorkers have adapted to climate change, and its underwater-ness has become a tourist attraction. Whereas much of climate fiction stays in the realm of science-fiction and the metaphorical, Robinson brings us a very plausible future. As one of his characters puts it, New Yorkers are too stubborn to leave and their living conditions have never been ideal.

Although human life finds a way in this novel, it is profoundly changed.

The Grace Keepers, by Kristy Logan

In The Grace Keepers, the author paints an isolated future where we lose the connection to those around us. ((Arizona O’Neill))

When I first heard there was going to be a futuristic book about mermaids, I got very excited. But it turned out to be so much more than that.

In this future almost everyone, except for the rich, lives on boats. The boat the book follows is that of a travelling circus. A young girl, North, has a bear act in the circus. She has never known any other life and has had her bear since it was a cub. They travel from small island to small island to perform. And every time they arrive on shore, the stillness and firm ground upsets North, and she cannot wait to be back on the water.

Whereas most people on her boat dream of one day having enough money to live on land, North wants no part of it. As her connection to the sea grows, she starts to develop webbed feet and has dreams of breathing underwater.

It is foreshadowed that maybe North is part of the next generation of humans who will live under water like mermaids.

This novel is inspired by Scottish myths and fairy tales. But is also creates a future within the climate change narrative without ever pointing at it directly. There is barely any land left and to the reader it is clear why. Logan paints an isolated future where we lose the connection to those around us. Separated on boats, we aimlessly sail the waves, not clear what species we even are anymore.

Gold Fame Citrus, by Claire Vaye Watkins

In Gold Fame Citrus, a climate change disaster causes a national drought. ((Arizona O’Neill))

Watkins examines the emotional dearth that will come along with the predicted absence of fresh water.

Gold Fame Citrus is set in a California after a climate change disaster that has caused a national drought. The absence of fresh water has caused all societal structures to fall apart.

Watkins's imagined world is edgy, punk and reminiscent of Mad Max. People live in roving bands as a dune rapidly expands, turning the landscape into a desert.

In this parched backdrop, a couple named Luz and Ray kidnap a baby that is living with an absurd, vicious band of degenerates. They forge a family that is strangely beautiful and intimate, fraught with the dangers of commitment in a world without a future. When a perverse sex cult tries to tear the young family apart, Luz and Ray draw on the forgotten values of their luscious vanished pasts.

Watkins's writing is vivid, striking and somehow filled with tender wonder. The book also includes a bestiary of animals that have evolved into peculiar new species in the dune.

Moon of the Crusted Snow, by Waubgeshig Rice

In Moon of the Crusted Snow, everyone must learn how to return to their traditional Anishinaabe roots. ((Arizona O’Neill))

The climate change in this novel is played as a subtler note, coming to characters in dreams as a form of anxiety.

Moon of the Crusted Snow takes place at the beginning of winter on a Anishinaabe reservation in the North. One night, their power and phone lines go down, and they are disconnected from the North. They no longer have any shipment coming through for food and no one from Hydro has come to see them.

A brother comes home from college to tell everyone that the Western world has fallen into chaos. The community has to learn how to return to their traditional Anishinaabe roots.

Urban refugees start to arrive and the community struggles with the dilemma of allowing them to stay on their land and having to fight for control. The biggest struggle the characters face is the brutal winter ahead of them.

The main character, Evan, has nightmares about a snowfall that is too strong to walk through and a cold that will kill everyone around him. This is a nod to global warming in the North as the winters get longer and stronger.

The book provides a view of the climate change apocalypse through an Indigenous lens. It is another example of the rich explosion of stories that are coming from people of colour in this once exclusionary narrative genre.

The Overstory, by Richard Powers

The Overstory, a Pulitzer Prize winner, will make you think about the way we treat the planet. ((Arizona O’Neill))

This book follows the stories of a varied group of people who were each affected profoundly by a tree in their youths. Their paths meet when they protest the clear cutting of a forest later in life. The main characters of the book, however, are the trees themselves.

Powers explores the interconnectedness of trees and their modes of communication and desires. He captures the importance of trees in human life in both an ecological and spiritual manner.

The book argues that trees are sentient beings with a wisdom and sense of community which has so much to teach humans about happiness and fulfilment and survival.

The language and stories are gorgeously written, which lead to the book winning the Pulitzer Prize.

The trees are heartbreaking and so wonderful that the book makes you rethink the manner in which we treat the planet and the value of considering plants to be our equals here.",,"['world', 'trees', 'novel', 'climate', 'future', 'north', 'arizona', 'book', 'change', 'drowned']",,https://www.cbc.ca/books

The book provides a view of the climate change apocalypse through an Indigenous lens. It is another example of the rich explosion of stories that are coming from people of colour in this once exclusionary narrative genre.

The Overstory, by Richard Powers

The Overstory, a Pulitzer Prize winner, will make you think about the way we treat the planet. ((Arizona O’Neill))

This book follows the stories of a varied group of people who were each affected profoundly by a tree in their youths. Their paths meet when they protest the clear cutting of a forest later in life. The main characters of the book, however, are the trees themselves.

Powers explores the interconnectedness of trees and their modes of communication and desires. He captures the importance of trees in human life in both an ecological and spiritual manner.

The book argues that trees are sentient beings with a wisdom and sense of community which has so much to teach humans about happiness and fulfilment and survival.

The language and stories are gorgeously written, which lead to the book winning the Pulitzer Prize.

The trees are heartbreaking and so wonderful that the book makes you rethink the manner in which we treat the planet and the value of considering plants to be our equals here.",,"['world', 'trees', 'novel', 'climate', 'future', 'north', 'arizona', 'book', 'change', 'drowned']",,https://www.cbc.ca/books
1437,,Avid Reader Who Lives In Montreal. She Is Heather'S Daughter. Follow Them On Their Instagram,"In the past year, we noticed how often we came across novels from all over the world set against a backdrop of climate change and ecological disaster — from Fever Dream by Samanta Schweblin, to The Emissary by Yoko Tawada, to American War by Omar El Akkad.

This obviously reflects a profound concern over the state of the planet that is infiltrating fiction today.

In fact, so pervasive is the genre that it has come to be known as cli-fi. We decided to look closely at five recent books, and one 20th century classic, that delve into the possibilities and dangers of a world that is changing in threatening and alienating ways due to our negligent effects on the environment.

The Drowned World, by J.G. Ballard

The Drowned World, written in 1962, has influenced many climate-fiction writers. ((Arizona O'Neill))

The Drowned World, written in 1962, is considered one of the founding texts of climate fiction. It was a novel ahead of its time that has influenced many writers since.

It takes place in the year 2145 in a post-apocalyptic London where the city is completely flooded and has turned into a tropical swamp. Everyone has fled the city, but we follow a team of scientists who are studying the new world that is now overrun by wildlife.

One of the most striking images in the book is of the giant lizards that now occupy the new lagoon threatening human life. The scientists work on the top of buildings that peak out over the watery streets.

It is interesting to read a text about global warming from the 1960s that does not have all the facts we do today about the scary outcome we might all face. We read this speculative text very differently in the 21st century and I suggest giving this eerie book a read.

New York 2140, by Kim Stanley Robinson

In New York 2140, the city is flooded. It’s a nod to J.G. Ballard’s classic The Drowned World. ((Arizona O’Neill))

This novel follows many characters in New York City who live in an apartment building in Madison Square that is flooded by 50 feet of water. Each skyscraper has become an island with glass walking tubes interconnecting them.

The city has continued to build upwards to create more living spaces, and certain poorer people live illegally on boats that float through the streets below. It is clear from the title that Kim Stanley Robinson, who was named a 'Hero of the Environment' by Time Magazine, is referencing J.G. Ballard's classic The Drowned World.

Both books take place in nearly the same year, 2140, and the major cities near water have flooded. The book's cover copy, in a direct nod to Ballard, states, ""New York in the year 2140 is far from a drowned city.""

There is a reference to Ballard in the book as well: ""Scientists published their papers, and shouted and waved their arms, and a few canny and deeply thoughtful sci-fi writers wrote up lurid accounts of such an eventuality, and the rest of civilization went in torching the planet like a Burning Man pyromasterpiece.""

Robinson, however, has a different take Ballard's watery future, and I would venture to say a more realistic one. Robinson paints a vision of the future where New Yorkers have adapted to climate change, and its underwater-ness has become a tourist attraction. Whereas much of climate fiction stays in the realm of science-fiction and the metaphorical, Robinson brings us a very plausible future. As one of his characters puts it, New Yorkers are too stubborn to leave and their living conditions have never been ideal.

Although human life finds a way in this novel, it is profoundly changed.

The Grace Keepers, by Kristy Logan

In The Grace Keepers, the author paints an isolated future where we lose the connection to those around us. ((Arizona O’Neill))

When I first heard there was going to be a futuristic book about mermaids, I got very excited. But it turned out to be so much more than that.

In this future almost everyone, except for the rich, lives on boats. The boat the book follows is that of a travelling circus. A young girl, North, has a bear act in the circus. She has never known any other life and has had her bear since it was a cub. They travel from small island to small island to perform. And every time they arrive on shore, the stillness and firm ground upsets North, and she cannot wait to be back on the water.

Whereas most people on her boat dream of one day having enough money to live on land, North wants no part of it. As her connection to the sea grows, she starts to develop webbed feet and has dreams of breathing underwater.

It is foreshadowed that maybe North is part of the next generation of humans who will live under water like mermaids.

This novel is inspired by Scottish myths and fairy tales. But is also creates a future within the climate change narrative without ever pointing at it directly. There is barely any land left and to the reader it is clear why. Logan paints an isolated future where we lose the connection to those around us. Separated on boats, we aimlessly sail the waves, not clear what species we even are anymore.

Gold Fame Citrus, by Claire Vaye Watkins

In Gold Fame Citrus, a climate change disaster causes a national drought. ((Arizona O’Neill))

Watkins examines the emotional dearth that will come along with the predicted absence of fresh water.

Gold Fame Citrus is set in a California after a climate change disaster that has caused a national drought. The absence of fresh water has caused all societal structures to fall apart.

Watkins's imagined world is edgy, punk and reminiscent of Mad Max. People live in roving bands as a dune rapidly expands, turning the landscape into a desert.

In this parched backdrop, a couple named Luz and Ray kidnap a baby that is living with an absurd, vicious band of degenerates. They forge a family that is strangely beautiful and intimate, fraught with the dangers of commitment in a world without a future. When a perverse sex cult tries to tear the young family apart, Luz and Ray draw on the forgotten values of their luscious vanished pasts.

Watkins's writing is vivid, striking and somehow filled with tender wonder. The book also includes a bestiary of animals that have evolved into peculiar new species in the dune.

Moon of the Crusted Snow, by Waubgeshig Rice

In Moon of the Crusted Snow, everyone must learn how to return to their traditional Anishinaabe roots. ((Arizona O’Neill))

The climate change in this novel is played as a subtler note, coming to characters in dreams as a form of anxiety.

Moon of the Crusted Snow takes place at the beginning of winter on a Anishinaabe reservation in the North. One night, their power and phone lines go down, and they are disconnected from the North. They no longer have any shipment coming through for food and no one from Hydro has come to see them.

A brother comes home from college to tell everyone that the Western world has fallen into chaos. The community has to learn how to return to their traditional Anishinaabe roots.

Urban refugees start to arrive and the community struggles with the dilemma of allowing them to stay on their land and having to fight for control. The biggest struggle the characters face is the brutal winter ahead of them.

The main character, Evan, has nightmares about a snowfall that is too strong to walk through and a cold that will kill everyone around him. This is a nod to global warming in the North as the winters get longer and stronger.

The book provides a view of the climate change apocalypse through an Indigenous lens. It is another example of the rich explosion of stories that are coming from people of colour in this once exclusionary narrative genre.

1440,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"Few writers seem to embody literary Ireland more than Yeats or Joyce. But for many Irish writers and readers, there are none greater than Samuel Beckett.



Beckett did embody an Irish temperament — self-deprecating humour, sensitivity to language, a preoccupation with death, a sense of being a prisoner in his own home.

And yet his leitmotif was failure. His artistic triumphs took failure to be an inescapable part — the essence of the human condition.

But considering he was the poet laureate of failure, futility and the absurd, Beckett did all right for himself.

He revolutionized theatre and fiction. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. And he became one of those rare figures of the avant-garde, who is a mainstay of popular culture.

I can't go on, I'll go on. - Samuel Becket from his novel, The Unnamable

Beckett's, Waiting for Godot was first performed in Paris in 1953. It's arguably the most important and influential play of the 20th Century, and certainly the defining moment of the Theatre of the Absurd.

Two sad-sack old men, Vladimir and Estragon, pace back and forth and wander in circles across a barren set, bickering and getting lost in circular conversations — downtrodden tramps waiting for as long as they can remember for the mysterious Godot.

Godot gave Beckett a forbidding reputation for bleakness, absurdity and austerity. Confronted by the lack of plot, action or sense, a lot of people encountering Beckett come away as baffled, bored and frustrated as Vladimir and Estragon themselves.

The plays that followed became increasingly spare and difficult. Meanwhile, Beckett's fiction confounded the very nature of plot and character — even of sentences and paragraphs.

But Beckett's writing contains many more dimensions than despair and meaninglessness. It's full of humour, defiance, an exuberant love of language and humanity.

On this month's edition of The Enright Files, guests explore Irish literature with a special focus on Samuel Beckett.

Guests in this episode:

Declan Kiberd , cultural historian and author of After Ireland: Writing the Nation from Beckett to the Present

1451,Sports-no-CBC,Scott Russell Has Worked For The Cbc For More Than Years,"For the first time since I can remember, ominous clouds loomed upon our arrival for the National Show Jumping Tournament at the outset of June at Spruce Meadows.

The turf in the international ring showed off its' traditionally, resplendent, emerald green. The grounds were lush and teeming with activity. A new soccer stadium had suddenly appeared on ""Meadows on the Green"" and its occupants, Cavalry FC of the fledgling Canadian Premier League, boasted a perfect record in the early going of the ambitious loop.

But for Canadian horse sport, namely show jumping, times are changing.

The ageless, Ian Millar, ""Captain Canada"" as he's come to be known, wore jeans and a cowboy hat and not riding britches and a helmet as he surveyed the course.

For the first time in the 44-year history of this magnificent venue he is not scheduled to compete in one of his sports' biggest international gatherings.

At 72 years of age, the 10-time Olympian, two-time World Cup final winner, four-time Pan Am Games champion, and member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, has retired and now coaches the next generation of riders.

""For all things there comes a time,"" Millar mused, his feet firmly planted on the familiar playing field. ""I'm as good as one can be at this stage of my career. No one wants to see an elite athlete lose a step.""

And yet, for so many years they've come in droves to see him at this place, arguably the best facility of its kind on the face of the earth, and unquestionably a bona-fide national treasure.

There are 20 nations represented here at the National this year. It's the largest opening tournament to the summer season in Spruce Meadows history featuring 350 horses from around the globe as well as myriad Olympic and world championship medallists.

It is a competitive roster which has rarely been rivaled.

Lamaze focused on riding

Included is 51-year-old Canadian, Eric Lamaze, the most prolific rider in Spruce Meadows history. Not only has he won millions of dollars here, Lamaze is also the most decorated equestrian this country has ever produced.

There are three Olympic medals, including the individual title in 2008, as well as a world championship medal to his credit. That's not to mention Pan Am gold and a resumé which includes every major, professional, accolade his sport can offer.

But Lamaze is riding against the current. He recently revealed in an interview with a French broadcaster that he`s been battling cancer for a year and a half. But that won`t deter what he`s here at Spruce Meadows to do.

""I don't want people to look at me as anyone other than Eric Lamaze,"" he said after dismounting his horse, Chacco Kid, following a clear round performance on Thursday.

""I'm battling a brain tumour, but I have to deal with this by myself as best I can. I am going to ride as long as I can because this makes me happy. I can ride, I can teach and I do what I can.""

Indeed, Lamaze has steadfastly deflected attention from his personal struggle and in a press release prior to the National urged the fans of show jumping to cast their collective attention to what happens inside the ring and not beyond its borders.

""I want to be treated like everyone else and I appreciate everyone's thoughts,"" Lamaze said. ""But I've shared my story and now I want us all to move on and focus on sport.""

""I completely agree with that,"" the Canadian team leader, chef d'equipe, Mark Laskin said of Lamaze's mindset. ""It's absolutely natural. Now he wants to be focused on applying his craft. He is the consummate competitor.""

Uphill battle to Tokyo

That said, with the retirement from international competition of Millar and the formidable situation Eric Lamaze is confronting, the long standing foundation of Canadian show jumping has been somewhat shaken.

Canada faces an uphill battle to finish in the top four at the Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, next month in order to qualify a full team for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Not since the Athens Games in 2004, when Millar was the lone Canadian rider, has Canada failed to challenge for a team medal at the Olympics.

""It's a bit unsettling because for the first time in a long time there are a couple of people that we can't automatically count on,"" Laskin admitted.

""It's a bit unclear. There's a lot to be decided and we can't take any of our competition for granted.""

The same might be said of any sport. Nothing is a given and the tide can turn in the blink of an eye.

There are many things you can bank on in this place which is full of rich tradition. On the other hand things are often as capricious as the weather which more often than not plays its part in the narrative of horse jumping in southern Alberta.

The winds of change, it seems, are constantly swirling at Spruce Meadows.","For the first time since I can remember, ominous clouds loomed upon our arrival for the National Show Jumping Tournament at the outset of June at Spruce Meadows.

1453,Sports-no-CBC,Canadian Screen Award,"For the first time since I can remember, ominous clouds loomed upon our arrival for the National Show Jumping Tournament at the outset of June at Spruce Meadows.

The turf in the international ring showed off its' traditionally, resplendent, emerald green. The grounds were lush and teeming with activity. A new soccer stadium had suddenly appeared on ""Meadows on the Green"" and its occupants, Cavalry FC of the fledgling Canadian Premier League, boasted a perfect record in the early going of the ambitious loop.

But for Canadian horse sport, namely show jumping, times are changing.

The ageless, Ian Millar, ""Captain Canada"" as he's come to be known, wore jeans and a cowboy hat and not riding britches and a helmet as he surveyed the course.

For the first time in the 44-year history of this magnificent venue he is not scheduled to compete in one of his sports' biggest international gatherings.

At 72 years of age, the 10-time Olympian, two-time World Cup final winner, four-time Pan Am Games champion, and member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, has retired and now coaches the next generation of riders.

""For all things there comes a time,"" Millar mused, his feet firmly planted on the familiar playing field. ""I'm as good as one can be at this stage of my career. No one wants to see an elite athlete lose a step.""

And yet, for so many years they've come in droves to see him at this place, arguably the best facility of its kind on the face of the earth, and unquestionably a bona-fide national treasure.

There are 20 nations represented here at the National this year. It's the largest opening tournament to the summer season in Spruce Meadows history featuring 350 horses from around the globe as well as myriad Olympic and world championship medallists.

It is a competitive roster which has rarely been rivaled.

Lamaze focused on riding

Included is 51-year-old Canadian, Eric Lamaze, the most prolific rider in Spruce Meadows history. Not only has he won millions of dollars here, Lamaze is also the most decorated equestrian this country has ever produced.

There are three Olympic medals, including the individual title in 2008, as well as a world championship medal to his credit. That's not to mention Pan Am gold and a resumé which includes every major, professional, accolade his sport can offer.

But Lamaze is riding against the current. He recently revealed in an interview with a French broadcaster that he`s been battling cancer for a year and a half. But that won`t deter what he`s here at Spruce Meadows to do.

""I don't want people to look at me as anyone other than Eric Lamaze,"" he said after dismounting his horse, Chacco Kid, following a clear round performance on Thursday.

""I'm battling a brain tumour, but I have to deal with this by myself as best I can. I am going to ride as long as I can because this makes me happy. I can ride, I can teach and I do what I can.""

Indeed, Lamaze has steadfastly deflected attention from his personal struggle and in a press release prior to the National urged the fans of show jumping to cast their collective attention to what happens inside the ring and not beyond its borders.

""I want to be treated like everyone else and I appreciate everyone's thoughts,"" Lamaze said. ""But I've shared my story and now I want us all to move on and focus on sport.""

""I completely agree with that,"" the Canadian team leader, chef d'equipe, Mark Laskin said of Lamaze's mindset. ""It's absolutely natural. Now he wants to be focused on applying his craft. He is the consummate competitor.""

Uphill battle to Tokyo

That said, with the retirement from international competition of Millar and the formidable situation Eric Lamaze is confronting, the long standing foundation of Canadian show jumping has been somewhat shaken.

Canada faces an uphill battle to finish in the top four at the Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, next month in order to qualify a full team for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Not since the Athens Games in 2004, when Millar was the lone Canadian rider, has Canada failed to challenge for a team medal at the Olympics.

""It's a bit unsettling because for the first time in a long time there are a couple of people that we can't automatically count on,"" Laskin admitted.

""It's a bit unclear. There's a lot to be decided and we can't take any of our competition for granted.""

The Stanley Cup has seen and been through a lot since it was first awarded to the Montreal Hockey Club in 1893. If the Stanley Cup could talk, it would have some of the most interesting stories to tell.

The Cup has also had it's fair share of bumps and bruises. Rocket Richard dropped it in 1993. In 1994, a member of the NY Rangers ripped off its head.

Lowry scored 23 points and made several big shots in a 123-109 victory that gave the Raptors a 2-1 lead over Golden State. There was as much buzz about Lowry's dust-up with the fan as his offence.

Lowry ran down a loose ball and jumped in the air as it was going out of bounds, not far from where Warriors owner Joe Lacob was sitting. Lowry knocked the ball into a referee and landed in the lap of one male fan who appeared to grab Lowry's jersey with two hands.

Capuano has signed a three-year contract and will work under new Senators head coach D.J. Smith.

The 52-year-old Capuano spent the last two seasons as an associate coach with the Florida Panthers. Before that, he was head coach for parts of seven seasons with the Islanders from 2010 to 2017, going 227-192-64 with three playoff appearances.

A native of Cranston, R.I., Capuano began his coaching career in 1996-97 as an assistant coach in the ECHL. He was an assistant with the Islanders in 2006-07 before taking the reins of the American Hockey League affiliate in Bridgeport, Conn., from 2007 to 2010.

Capuano appeared in six NHL games as a defenceman for the Boston Bruins (1991-92), Vancouver Canucks (1990-91) and Toronto Maple Leafs (1989-90).

""Jack brings a wealth of coaching experience in the National Hockey League and is a great fit with our staff,"" Smith said in a statement.

1464,Sports-no-CBC,Thomson Reuters,"Brooks Koepka arrived at this week's Canadian Open as the star attraction but said he does not really care about his result as long as he leaves with his game sharp ahead of next week's U.S. Open.

Two-times defending U.S. Open champion Koepka has played the week before each of his four major championship victories, and is happy to use the preceding event as a tune-up for the bigger stakes that follow.

""It doesn't really matter about the result. I couldn't care less what happens,"" the American said on Wednesday at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ontario, a comment that will not win any prizes for diplomacy.

""It's just how I feel I've played, am I hitting enough good shots and really finding a rhythm?

""I just want to feel good going into next week.""

The U.S. Open runs from June 13-16 at Pebble Beach, where the 29-year-old has a chance to become the first player in over a century to win the tournament in three consecutive years.

Koepka had two weeks off after winning the PGA Championship at Bethpage last month, and says he did not touch a club during the fortnight, preferring to relax before hopefully playing his way back into form in Canada.

""As long as I can leave feeling confident, striking the ball very well, starting it where I want to, finishing where I want to, hit some good putts, it doesn't matter if they go in or not, I just want to feel confident leaving.""

The Canadian Open is the world's third oldest national championship, first played in 1904, and it has a bumper field this year after moving to an earlier timeslot in the schedule.

Defending champion Dustin Johnson is playing, Rory McIlroy makes his first appearance, while Justin Thomas is teeing up as he plays his way back from a wrist injury that caused him to miss the PGA Championship.

Officials have presented a Hamilton course with plenty of rough, which prompted a thumbs up from Koepka.

""I think it's actually a perfect set-up for next week,"" he said.

A couple of key changes have stacked the odds against Dustin Johnson as he tries to defend his Canadian Open title.

The No. 2 golfer in the world pulled away from the field after a nearly two-hour rain delay to win his first Canadian Open last year, firing 6-under 66 in last year's final round to finish at 23 under. But this year the only Canadian stop on the PGA Tour has moved from Glen Abbey Golf Club, a course Johnson is familiar with, to Hamilton Golf and Country Club.

More importantly, the tournament has moved up in the golf calendar, making it a lead-in event to the U.S. Open and drawing a significantly stronger group of competitors.

""I mean, it's a really good field. It's a golf course I haven't played. That definitely adds a little bit more difficulty to it,"" said defending champion Dustin Johnson on Wednesday. ""I don't know the golf course as well as I know Glen Abbey, where I played a lot of Opens.""

""This isn't just a preparation week. This is a very prestigious tournament, one of the oldest tournaments in the world that I would dearly love to be able to add my name to,"" said McIlroy, who has never played a competitive tournament in Canada. ""I'm fully focused on this week, but knowing that if I play well here, this week, and have good control of my ball and my distance control, that will serve me well going into next week. ""

One problem for Johnson, Koepka and McIlroy is that none of them had a chance to play a full practice round. Due to off-site sponsor obligations and a pro-am tournament on Monday, they were half-round as part of a pro-am on Wednesday.

""I like the front nine. It's the only nine I've seen, but yeah, I like the golf course,"" said Johnson, whose brother Austin serves as his caddy. ""(Austin) went out Tuesday and kind of looked at it. He's good enough now where he can got a pretty good beat on the course.""

That lack of familiarity may give the 26-player Canadian contingent a brief edge, at least for the first round.

MacKenzie Hughes, who has played Hamilton Golf and Country Club numerous times, says that familiarity will be an advantage during this week's Canadian Open. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)

Mackenzie Hughes of neighbouring Dundas, Ont., has played Hamilton dozens of times. Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., took in a practice round in May and Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., played in the Canadian Open when it was last in Hamilton in 2012.

""I think it's a huge advantage. There's an added comfort level, just knowing the course and knowing what to expect,"" said Conners. ""I'm really happy that I got the chance to play a few weeks ago. I got a plan together and to be familiar with the terrain, know what to expect and just definitely an added comfort level for the Canadians.""

A total of 26 Canadians will be competing for the national championship. No Canadian has won the event since Pat Fletcher in 1954.

On top of the 20 that were announced in the final field on Friday, James Allenby of Langley, B.C., Thomas DeMarco of LaSalle, Ont., Etienne Brault of Mercier, Que, and Toronto's JC Deacon all qualified on Monday at Heron Point Golf Links in Alberton, Ont.

Albin Choi and Richard Lee, both from Toronto, were also late additions to the field with exemptions.

""We all — I've been in here probably four, five, six years in a row now — and all we've talked about is 1954,"" said Hadwin. ""Until one of us does that, I think it's going to hold a lot of value for us.""","I couldn't care less what happens,"" the American said on Wednesday at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ontario, a comment that will not win any prizes for diplomacy.

That much had been obvious since the team had been named after a dinosaur.

1467,logo,Cbc Television,"X Company tells the heartbreaking and courageous story of what went on behind the scenes during World War II, leading up to D-Day. The invasion would not have been successful were it not for the combined efforts of allied agents who were responsible for deceiving the Germans as to when and where the invasion would take place.

THE WAR AT HOME

While the fighting raged along the front lines in Europe, the effort to stop the war was being fought in a different way in Canada. In factories, bases, and secret locations such as Casa Loma, Canadian women worked tirelessly to fabricate exact copies of enemy uniforms and currency, decipher enemy communications, monitor our coast for any signs of German U-Boats, and many other crucial tasks.

SPY TRAINING

On December 6, 1941, Camp X was established up in Whitby, Ontario. Run by Sir William Stephenson - Canada's top spymaster - the camp trained Allied agents in close combat, sabotage, intelligence, and forgery. Camp X was decommissioned at the end of 1944.

Espionage has always played a key role in war and politics, and World War II was no different. New technology meant new challenges and approaches, and Canada was a key player in training Allied agents to handle those challenges.

COMBAT COMMUNICATIONS

The need to quickly, effectively, and secretly communicate among Allied troops and agents was crucial. When an Enigma Device was finally captured, keeping that fact hidden - along with misleading the Nazis - became a a key factor in turning the tide of World War II.

SAVING PARIS

A month after the Allies took Normandy, their armoured divisions were advancing on Paris, a hotbed of resistance and spy activity. Hitler had sent directions to destroy the city, but Paris was spared by an unlikely saviour.

TRAINS AND TRANSPORTATION

Germany had an extensive rail system well before World War II, and with the occupation of France their network extended throughout Western Europe. After D-Day, the Allies sought a way to move their troops independently of the rail lines, and the result was the Red Ball Express: a truck convoy mostly staffed with African American soldiers.

We're used to the Toronto Raptors now, but nine other names were in the running in April 1994.

CBC ARCHIVES | The birth of the Toronto Raptors as a logo

The team's ownership held a media event for the shortlist of the possibilities they were considering.

""Beavers: that broad-tailed rodent,"" said CBC reporter Ken Daniels. ""Bobcats, known for keen sight.""

He continued, gamely summarizing the chief attribute of each of the name options.

Hogs? Really?

""Grizzlies"" and ""Hogs"" were just two of the ten possibilities for the team's name. (CBLT Newshour/CBC Archives)

They were, in alphabetical order:

Beavers

Bobcats

Dragons (""the mythical winged monster"")

Grizzlies

Hogs (""Toronto was once affectionately known as Hogtown"")

Raptors

Scorpions

T-Rex (""known as the king of the dinosaurs"")

Tarantulas

Terriers (""for dog lovers"")

""Raptors: short form for a family of dinosaurs, velociraptor if you're familiar with Jurassic Park,"" said Daniels.

The Grizzlies name, of course, was later adopted by the NBA franchise awarded to Vancouver.

The names would then go to a vote by members of the public and kids under 18 were especially encouraged to register their choice.

Claws got respect

""Mascots are a very important part of the whole thing,"" said John Bitove, one of the owners of Toronto's yet-unnamed NBA team. (CBLT Newshour/CBC News)

John Bitove, one of the owners of the new team, said there was a reason why all the choices were animal names: merchandise.

""The animal images, in terms of T-shirts and hats, have by far sold the most,"" he said, ""with the Sharks and the Hornets and the Bulls being the leaders.""

But he wasn't concerned he would regret it if a ""trendy"" name like Raptors won the contest.

""You have to go with what the people want,"" he said. ""Because it's trendy now ... means we want to be part of the trend.""

According to the Globe and Mail, three finalists — Bobcats, Dragons and Raptors — were named before the winner was revealed.

1469,,Cbc Archives,"In the summer of 1971, a lot of young people saw Canada by sticking out their thumbs. But one Ontario town wasn't about to roll out the welcome mat for them.

An unused school building on the edge of North Bay, Ont., was the proposed site for a youth hostel for young people passing through. (CBC News/CBC Archives)

Riverbend Public School, ""well out on the fringes"" of North Bay, Ont., was at the centre of a town controversy — ""a controversy that seems to be popping up coast to coast this June,"" said the CBC's Norman Depoe.

""It's not a very big building, but it's big enough to be a hostel for the wandering youth, with separate accommodations for boys and girls,"" said Depoe.

The local board of education had approved the idea to convert it to a shelter, and that's when the trouble began.

The city council, on the other hand, voted ""in solid majority"" to reconsider the whole proposal, and some members of the chamber of commerce tried to do the same.

The CBC camera caught images of young people walking along the town's main street, some of whom may have been among the 3,000 to 5,000 young people who were expected to pass through in 1971.

""A hundred residents of the school district turned out to protest last month,"" reported Depoe. ""Their complaints: drugs, sex, dirty hippies — and they didn't want people like that in a children's play area.""

There was also the perception that tax dollars were supporting a group that local businesses viewed as vagrants, and that local police would be overstretched by the need to check regularly on a building far out of town.

The hostel was to be run by a committee made of of representatives from local churches.

According to the Toronto Star, the committee apparently overcame the town's objection and was scheduled to open the hostel in July 1971 with a grant from the federal government.",,"['school', 'building', 'hostel', 'north', 'cbc', '1971', 'bay', 'ont', 'local', 'young']",,https://www.cbc.ca/television

Reviving an Indigenous language in Manitoulin Island, Ont.

(Rhiannon Johnson/CBC)

It may come as a surprise that a northern Ontario island town of 13,000 people is where technology is being used to revive a language, but that’s true of Manitoulin Island.

Residents have helped create an app that teaches the Anishinaabemowin language through lessons on common words and phrases in a gamified-style that lets users collect points and compete against others.

Indigenous language loss was highlighted in the final report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which said residential schooling along with physical abuse contributed to the decline of these languages. Experts say the majority of Indigenous languages in Canada are endangered.

The app is part of Challenge4Change, an initiative by members of the Wiikwemkoong Unceded Nation on Manitoulin Island to retain and grow Indigenous languages in Canada. It is free and can be found under “Challenge4Change - Languages” on Android and iPhone devices.

Promoting ethical consumerism in Selkirk, Man.

Knowing that global trade practices are often unfair, residents of Selkirk, Man., have made their town one of the best places in Canada to shop for ethical products. The town, home to 10,000 residents, is known for its support of fair trade.



Fair trade certification guarantees better work conditions and pay for the workers and farmers that produce the products — and everything from coffee to flowers can be fair trade. Companies that are certified must meet social, economic and environmental standards, such as investing in community projects and not participating in child labour.



Last year, Fair Trade Canada named Selkirk the Fair Trade Town of The Year because of the availability of fair trade certified products in the town and the commitment of the local municipality authority to source and purchase ethical products. In fact, the City of Selkirk became the first municipal government in Canada to be a Fair Trade Workplace.



With a number of local businesses stocking fair trade products, residents of Selkirk have ethical purchasing options when shopping at the liquor store, local café and more.

Saving birds in Antigonish, N.S.

Aerial insectivores (birds which feed on insects in flights) are on the decline in Canada, and one Nova Scotian town is doing something about it.

Residents of Antigonish, a town of 4,300 people, are building nest boxes that the Tree Swallows can use for nesting.

The group received a small community grant to build 100 boxes for Tree Swallows, and when local businesses and the mill operator heard about the project, they pitched in, contributing enough nails and wood to build almost double the target number of boxes.



The nest boxes were built by members of the local Boy Scouts and 4-H. The boxes have been going up over the last year and are being monitored by the kids who built them and their families.



Randy Lauff, an ornithologist, who spearheaded the project says, “We’re not quite sure why they’re declining [Tree Swallows], so providing nesting sites certainly helps them out.”

There have already been a number of nestings, and more boxes are set to go up prior to the next breeding season. Lauff hopes the kids will be monitoring the boxes for many years.

Welcoming refugees in North Dundas, Ont.

(Eric Duncan/Facebook)

Across the country, Canadians have been welcoming Syrian refugees who are making Canada their new home. In North Dundas, a community of about 2,400 people 50 kilometres from Ottawa, residents have made a commendable effort to support a Syrian family.

Twenty people in the community fundraised for two years to raise the money needed to bring the family to Canada. This summer, they warmly welcomed Dania Al Muazzen, Adel Al Ghorani and their three children to North Dundas.

When the family arrived, community members pitched in to ease their transition. A local dentist volunteered to provide free dental care for the family. One community member donated a vehicle to the family. Local retailers provided the parts needed to fix it up and students from the high school volunteered to do the repairs. Teachers pitched in to cover costs so the family’s teenage son could join the local soccer league and his team members provided cleats.

The town’s mayor, Eric Duncan even gave up his own home for the family. Duncan, 30, moved in with his mother for five months, allowing the newly-arrived family to save money before moving into their own accommodations.

Championing autistic-friendly communities in Channel-Port aux Basques, N.L.

At the southwestern tip of Newfoundland, lies Channel-Port aux Basques, home to 4,000 people who’ve made it Canada’s most autism-friendly town.

Six years ago, the town had no resources to support families with autistic children. In fact, parents had to drive over two hours to access basic resources for their children, making them feel isolated.

That changed when a retired special education teacher, Joan Chaisson, along with April Billard, a mother to a son with Autism Spectrum Disorder, started a group called Autism Involves Me. The group built a library of parenting books, provided sensory toys for their kids and became a support to parents in the community.

Soon, they began to think of ways to include others in their work. The duo trained everyone — from the local barber to waitresses — on how to interact with children with autism and what they could do to create more inclusive spaces.

One of the people they trained was Cathy Lomond, owner of Hotel Port aux Basques, who embraced the idea by creating a sensory room for kids and developing picture menus for the hotel restaurant so that non-verbal kids could place their order by pointing. National media called it “Canada’s first autism-friendly hotel” and they’ve been booked up with visitors who are flocking to the town for its inclusivity.

Tuna tartare has often been one of those appetizers we gravitate to when dining out, but feel too intimidated to try making it at home. Well, that’s all changing with this simple recipe by John Bil, the late, great seafood aficionado and Toronto restaurateur, from his posthumously-released cookbook Ship to Shore: Straight Talk from the Seafood Counter. Made with citrus, spices and raw tuna, then served ceviche-style for easy scooping and sharing, it’s just the kind of starter you need for summer — whether you’re spending yours hosting pals on the patio, or in the kitchen expanding your recipe repertoire.

Albacore Tartare

By John Bil

Tartare is a very simple way to prepare raw fish. Now widely used in restaurants, albacore tuna has replaced the less readily available and more expensive bluefin tuna, so it’s pretty easy to find. Ginger and lime provide a lovely fresh flavour, making this the ideal starter for a summer dinner.

Ingredients

¼ cup crystallized turbinado sugar

3 tbsp fish sauce

Juice from 2 limes

Juice from 1 small chunk of peeled ginger

1 cayenne pepper, seeded and diced

1 small bunch of fresh coriander, leaves, stems, and roots finely chopped

1 clove garlic, crushed and minced

Salt, to taste

300 to 400 g (10.5 to 14 oz) albacore tuna loin, cut into ½-cm (¼-inch) cubes

Preparation

In a bowl, combine sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, ginger juice, diced cayenne pepper, chopped coriander, and minced garlic. Mix together using a metal spoon, occasionally crushing mixture against the side of the bowl to release more flavour. Taste and add salt, if needed. Add cubed tuna and stir gently. Taste. If acidity is low, squeeze a bit more lime juice into the mixture. Serve with small toasts.

Yield: Serves 4-6 as an appetizer

This lion topper is made with cookie dough, which is much more forgiving than pastry, so it's a great project for bakers at every skill level — and a fun project to do with kids.

On dessert duty for your Pride celebration? This colourful and easy-to-make topper is the perfect centrepiece 6:47

Ingredients

Orange-infused Blueberry Pie Filling:

Fruit:

8 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)

Zest of 2 oranges

1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice

⅔ cup sugar

¼ tsp salt

Thickener:

⅔ cup sugar

6 tbsp cornstarch

⅓ cup water (or more orange juice if you have it)

Spices (optional):

1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg

1 tsp cardamom powder

For shine:

¼ cup unsalted butter

Pie Crust:

*Note: This makes enough for a double crust pie, you can halve the recipe below, or make the whole recipe and freeze the extra half, wrapped well in plastic for up to three months.

1 ½ cups cold butter

6 tbsp cold lard

5 ¾ cups of flour (divided) plus more for dusting surface

1 ½ tsp sugar

1 ½ tsp kosher salt

6 tbsp ice cold water (ice water is best)

6 tbsp cold vodka

Best Vanilla Cookie Dough:

1 ½ cup unsalted butter (room temperature)

1 ¾ cup white sugar

¾ tsp salt

3 large eggs

1 ½ tbsp vanilla extract

4 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

Special equipment:

9.5"" x 1.5"" deep pie plate

Printed and cut out stencil for the pie (in this case, a lion)

Large teardrop shaped cookie cutter

Gel food colouring

Paintbrushes

Preparation

For the orange-infused blueberry pie filling:

In a 4 litre saucepan, combine the blueberries, orange zest and juice, sugar and salt. Stir and cook over medium heat until the liquids begin to simmer.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, make the thickener. Combine the sugar and cornstarch well, then add ⅓ cup water and stir until smooth.

Once berry mixture begins to simmer, pour in the thickener and stir until glossy and thick. This happens pretty quickly — in about 3 minutes. Simmer the thickened filling for about a minute, then remove from heat. Add in the spices if you're using them, and then add in the butter. Stir until the butter melts and combine well. Remove from heat and allow the filling to cool at least to room temperature.

For the pie dough:

Cut butter and lard into ½ inch pieces and place in the fridge or freezer momentarily to keep it cold. Combine 2 cups of the flour with the sugar and salt in the bowl of your food processor (using a food processor helps keep the crust cold and therefore flaky). Add the cold butter and lard cubes, and pulse about 6 times for 2-3 seconds until the fats resemble coarse crumbs with some cottage cheese-sized pieces. Then add the rest of your flour and pulse again. Sprinkle the ice cold water and cold vodka over top, and pulse a few more times until the pastry dough comes together in a ball.

Turn out the dough onto a clean surface and use your hands to bring any loose pieces together, then divide it in half. Wrap each separately in plastic wrap, and flatten them into two 6-inch x 1-inch thick discs. Place one in the refrigerator (freeze the other for another use, see note above*) to chill for at least 45 minutes before rolling.

Generously flour your counter and pin, and roll out pastry to ¼ inch thickness, roll dough around a rolling pin and gently unroll over top of an empty pie plate. Press and form into pie plate. Trim off any excess dough that hangs over the edge of the pie plate and use a fork to make indentations along the crust.

Preheat the oven to 350F degrees.

Chill the pie crust for 30 minutes, while you work on your decorations. Place a piece of parchment paper in the chilled crust and fill it with dried beans, rice or pie weights. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until it is completely cooked through. Carefully remove the hot parchment paper and beans. Cool the crust to room temperature. Fill your pie shell with the cooled filling just before you are ready to decorate.

For the cookie dough:

Cream the butter, sugar and salt in a mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and whip until well combined. Add in the vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, add in the flour a bit at a time, until a firm dough forms. Pour out the dough onto a clean surface and knead until it all comes together. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

To make the lion:

Place the printed stencil on a baking sheet, and place a sheet of parchment paper on top; you will build your cookie shape right on top of this, using it as your template. Roll the sugar cookie dough between your hands to warm it a bit (reserve some for the leaves in the next section), and then press it into place on top of the parchment, following the stencil showing through underneath. Pinch and adjust the dough as needed to get the shapes right, and make sure you press all of the pieces together at the bottom so all of the pieces connect. Use the end of a paintbrush or a chopstick to help you make any small grooves and details. Once you are done, slide the pattern out from underneath and chill the dough on the parchment paper in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes. Then bake for 15-20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the dough. Do not brown.

For the cookies:

Roll the rest of the sugar cookie dough out to about a 3/16-inch thickness, dusting it with flour to ensure it won't stick. Using the large teardrop shaped cookie cutter, cut out enough shapes to go around the edge of the pie. Using spoons or a flat whisk, gently press some indentations into the round part of the teardrop. Chill for 30 minutes. Bake for 7-9 minutes; do not brown.

For the watercolours and painting:

In separate small bowls, mix one drop each food colouring paste with about 1 tablespoon of vodka. Mix together well. Paint the lion and the cookies, starting light and adding more colour if desired.

For assembly:

Place your cookies around the edge of your filled pie, and then place the lion right on top. Serve immediately.

1473,,Cbc News,"A B.C. university professor is trying to save bird populations by recruiting house cats to wear special collars designed to make hunting more difficult.

Ken Otter is asking pet owners in the Prince George area to keep a log of their cats comings and goings and report any prey they bring home.

""It's a sensitive issue because there's pros and cons around whether cats can be free roaming.""

The University of Northern B.C. biologist says domestic cats kill between 100 million and 350 million birds in Canada every year.

The statistic, estimated using the number of owned cats in Canada and the average prey they kill, represents between 2.5 and 7 per cent of the estimated bird population in Southern Canada, where cats are concentrated.

As well as logging their cat's prey, Otter's project with the City of Prince George and the Canadian Wildlife Service requires owners to put a high-visibility collar made of bright colours on their cats every other week and see whether they catch less prey.

""Birds have very good colour vision,"" said Otter. ""They're much more attuned to those colours than are other potential prey items like rodents, which are actually red-green colourblind for the most part.""

Ken Otter says one of the consequences of restricting cats' movements can be an increase in mouse and rodent population. (Ken Otter)

He says bells aren't effective at putting a stop to hunting because cats can learn to suppress their sound.

According to Otter, using the high-visibility collar should help limit feline hunting of birds without restricting their ability to catch house mice and rats, which are less of a wildlife concern.

""One of the reasons that cats were essentially domesticated has been around maintaining rodent populations,"" said Otter.

A survey linked to the project is also asking people about their opinions on overall cat biology and whether or not cats should be more closely monitored.

The research — funded by UNBC, the SPCA, veterinarians, and the Canadian Wildlife Service — may also help Prince George determine how it regulates cats.

""I would say it's a good idea to try and just from a responsible pet ownership to keep a handle on where your pets are at any given time.""

The pilot project will run over the course of the summer and could be extended, depending on the results. Anyone interested in participating can contact catstudy@unbc.ca.

1475,,Foreign Correspondent,"While Allied troops were still preparing for one of the largest military operations in history, a 20-year-old woman parachuted into occupied France under the cover of darkness — and injured her back and shoulder.

It was a flawed rendition of the four practice jumps Sonya d'Artois (originally Butt) had under her belt before undertaking the riskiest assignment of her life.

But given the rumours she'd heard about others being shot or captured the moment they landed, her jump on May 29, 1944 — nine days before D-Day — was still a success.

D'Artois's assignment as a secret agent behind those lines was never going to be easy: there were setbacks, mishaps and near misses that nearly cost her life.

But her subsequent accomplishments in helping the French resistance sabotage German efforts, along with the clandestine work of dozens of other female agents, helped the Allied forces make their the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, and ultimately win the Second World War.

CBC special live coverage:

""Never before had so many women been so closely involved in one of the great operations of a major war,"" said British historian Marcus Binney, author of The Women Who Lived For Danger: The Women Agents of S.O.E. in the Second World War.

""Their support for the D-Day landings, in advance of them and after them, was enormous, and was recognized by [Dwight] Eisenhower, by [Winston] Churchill — by everybody.""

'Set Europe ablaze'

D'Artois was one of 3,000 secret warrior women of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE), founded in 1940 at Churchill's request.

The organization, which also employed thousands of men, including many Canadians, was intended, in Churchill's words, to quietly ""set Europe ablaze.""

At 19, D'Artois was one of the youngest recruits, but she ticked many boxes: she was fluent in French, fit and willing to take risks.

D'Artois, shown at Versailles, would socialize with German soldiers at the same time she was co-ordinating ambushes against them while she worked with the French resistance. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

By evading capture and ultimately surviving the war — eventually growing into old age as a Canadian mother and then grandmother — d'Artois had displayed inordinate skill and determination.

They are traits that d'Artois displayed early in life.

After her parents separated, d'Artois lived with her mother in southern France.

When the war erupted, she was a teenager and alone at school while her mother happened to be visiting the U.K. She had no passport or money, and yet she made her way alone across an international border all the way to the U.K.

Reinventing her story

When she returned to France a few years later as a British agent, she once again had to improvise when the container carrying her clothing was discovered by a German patrol in the Le Mans area, likely alerting them to the arrival of a female agent.

She had to reinvent her story — which had her working in the couture business and visiting from Paris.

""We decided once they knew there was a woman there, she'd probably be hiding,"" she said in an interview for a documentary back in 2002.

""So we tried to fool them by not hiding.""

British historian Marcus Binney says the support d'Artois and other women working clandestinely was enormous for the D-Day landings. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

That meant she would frequent black market restaurants and socialize with German soldiers. All the while, the rest of the time, she was co-ordinating ambushes against them.

She was among several examples of women who proved that they were better suited than men for the task of clandestinely operating inside enemy territory.

""If you were in occupied France and you were a young man, they'd say, 'Why aren't you doing your military service, why aren't you doing work service in Germany?' "" said Binney.

""Women could travel more freely and they could be couriers. They could be radio officers or indeed weapons officers.

""They were very courageous.""

Effective instructor

At one time or another in 1944, D'Artois wore all those hats.

Trained at the SOE as an explosives expert, she would prove an effective instructor for French resistance fighters on the ins and outs of destroying rail lines and communications lines. She also covered countless kilometres on bicycle as a courier, recruiter, co-ordinator and intelligence gatherer.

""We knew the reason for it. It was to harass the Germans and break up their lines of communication and troop movement. Just obstruct them as much as possible.""

D'Artois was identified as Suzanne Bonvie in her fake papers. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

Her code name was Agent Blanche (or sometimes, Madeleine), but her fake papers identified her as Suzanne Bonvie.

More than once, she would have to run a gauntlet of German checkpoints, hoping they weren't on to her.

Once, she said in one interview, she narrowly escaped an assassination attempt meant specifically for her when she decided to avoid a resistance meeting — purely on instinct.

She also once dropped her purse, which contained a pistol, on the floor of one of the restaurants she frequented, risking blowing her cover.

'Perfectly calm'

In the chaos of liberation in 1944, she and a colleague, Sydney Hudson, were shot at, and while he was shot in the shoulder, she escaped unscathed — though her jacket was riddled with bullets.

""I never saw her not have a cool head,"" Hudson, who was her team leader in France, said in the 2002 documentary.

""Whatever the situation was, she remained perfectly calm.""

As a young woman, ""she was a rabble rouser,"" Nadya Murdoch, d'Artois's daughter, said in an interview in Montreal.

""She liked to get into trouble and she did all sorts of things with her brother that got her into trouble.""

She learned how to handle explosives. She learned how to make bombs. She learned how to blow up bridges. - Nadya Murdoch

But in extensive and arduous training in the U.K., where she was treated no differently than the men, she matured quickly, said Murdoch.

""She learned how to handle explosives. She learned how to make bombs. She learned how to blow up bridges. She learned how to pick a lock. She learned how to attack somebody. She learned how to do silent killing.…

""She learned a lot.""

Falling in love

It was also during training in early 1944 that she met Guy d'Artois, a French-Canadian member of the SOE.

Both had decided to specialize in explosives. They were then paired up to go on a mission together and soon became inseparable. They had fallen in love.

They decided to get married just before being deployed to France.

""Then they separated us, we couldn't go on the same mission,"" d'Artois said in that 2002 interview.

Superiors were concerned they would be liable to spill secrets if one of them was captured and tortured in front of the other. So they were deployed to different parts of France hundreds of kilometres apart.

They each did their part preparing for D-Day. In preparation for her mission, d'Artois was issued with a pistol and a suicide pill. She landed in France nine days before D-Day — exactly two weeks after her 20th birthday.

'Quite a lot of damage'

When the parachutes started raining down on Normandy, d'Artois stepped up her team's efforts to sabotage German efforts to move towards Allied troops.

""Because we knew the Allies had landed, we had a lot more confidence to do what we had to do. It was open warfare and we managed to do quite a lot of damage.""

D'Artois was lucky to avoid capture — unlike some of her colleagues who were imprisoned and killed.

When American soldiers came in as liberators in August 1944, she was taken away to have her head shaved to mark her as a collaborator — until her colleagues intervened and vouched for her identity as a British agent.

After the Second World War, d'Artois sailed to Canada, where she and her husband moved repeatedly to follow his military career before settling in Montreal. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

It would be several more months before she would be reunited with her husband Guy in France.

After the war, they moved to Canada and after relocating repeatedly to follow her husband's military career, they settled with their family in Montreal. She preferred to stay out of the limelight, out of deference for her husband, who served with the Royal 22nd Regiment, and was a decorated war hero in his own right.

Little did many know she had been made a member of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to the war effort.

Remembered today

Seventy-five years after she jumped into France, she's remembered on the beaches where all those young men landed in her footsteps.

Some of her belongings, including a compact and a cigarette case, are included in a special exhibition, Great Women During the War 1939-1945, at the Juno Beach Centre, developed by the Canadian War Museum, about women who participated in the war.

Both she and her husband Guy have passed away — Sonya d'Artois died in Montreal in 2014 at age of 90.

But members of their family, including Murdoch, have come to Juno Beach from Canada to revive their memory.

D'Artois is depicted as a daring, gutsy agent, but is known to her family only as a loving mother and grandmother.

She was ""very humble and just soft and gentle,"" said granddaughter Michaela d'Artois, 28. ""And I think that's really beautiful to be both: To be very strong and brave. But the most brave thing is to be gentle and soft""

Murdoch said of her parents: ""Their courage and their bravery was pretty incredible.""",,"['france', 'learned', 'dartois', 'dday', 'lines', 'submitted', 'war', 'women', '1944', 'german']",,https://www.cbc.ca/life

A Veteran Of Foreign Reportage,"While Allied troops were still preparing for one of the largest military operations in history, a 20-year-old woman parachuted into occupied France under the cover of darkness — and injured her back and shoulder.

It was a flawed rendition of the four practice jumps Sonya d'Artois (originally Butt) had under her belt before undertaking the riskiest assignment of her life.

But given the rumours she'd heard about others being shot or captured the moment they landed, her jump on May 29, 1944 — nine days before D-Day — was still a success.

D'Artois's assignment as a secret agent behind those lines was never going to be easy: there were setbacks, mishaps and near misses that nearly cost her life.

But her subsequent accomplishments in helping the French resistance sabotage German efforts, along with the clandestine work of dozens of other female agents, helped the Allied forces make their the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, and ultimately win the Second World War.

CBC special live coverage:

""Never before had so many women been so closely involved in one of the great operations of a major war,"" said British historian Marcus Binney, author of The Women Who Lived For Danger: The Women Agents of S.O.E. in the Second World War.

""Their support for the D-Day landings, in advance of them and after them, was enormous, and was recognized by [Dwight] Eisenhower, by [Winston] Churchill — by everybody.""

'Set Europe ablaze'

D'Artois was one of 3,000 secret warrior women of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE), founded in 1940 at Churchill's request.

The organization, which also employed thousands of men, including many Canadians, was intended, in Churchill's words, to quietly ""set Europe ablaze.""

At 19, D'Artois was one of the youngest recruits, but she ticked many boxes: she was fluent in French, fit and willing to take risks.

By evading capture and ultimately surviving the war — eventually growing into old age as a Canadian mother and then grandmother — d'Artois had displayed inordinate skill and determination.

They are traits that d'Artois displayed early in life.

After her parents separated, d'Artois lived with her mother in southern France.

When the war erupted, she was a teenager and alone at school while her mother happened to be visiting the U.K. She had no passport or money, and yet she made her way alone across an international border all the way to the U.K.

Reinventing her story

When she returned to France a few years later as a British agent, she once again had to improvise when the container carrying her clothing was discovered by a German patrol in the Le Mans area, likely alerting them to the arrival of a female agent.

She had to reinvent her story — which had her working in the couture business and visiting from Paris.

""We decided once they knew there was a woman there, she'd probably be hiding,"" she said in an interview for a documentary back in 2002.

""So we tried to fool them by not hiding.""

British historian Marcus Binney says the support d'Artois and other women working clandestinely was enormous for the D-Day landings. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

That meant she would frequent black market restaurants and socialize with German soldiers. All the while, the rest of the time, she was co-ordinating ambushes against them.

She was among several examples of women who proved that they were better suited than men for the task of clandestinely operating inside enemy territory.

""If you were in occupied France and you were a young man, they'd say, 'Why aren't you doing your military service, why aren't you doing work service in Germany?' "" said Binney.

""Women could travel more freely and they could be couriers. They could be radio officers or indeed weapons officers.

""They were very courageous.""

Effective instructor

At one time or another in 1944, D'Artois wore all those hats.

Trained at the SOE as an explosives expert, she would prove an effective instructor for French resistance fighters on the ins and outs of destroying rail lines and communications lines. She also covered countless kilometres on bicycle as a courier, recruiter, co-ordinator and intelligence gatherer.

""This was the job that we were there to do,"" she said in the 2002 documentary Behind Enemy Lines: The Real Charlotte Grays.

""We knew the reason for it. It was to harass the Germans and break up their lines of communication and troop movement. Just obstruct them as much as possible.""

It would be several more months before she would be reunited with her husband Guy in France.

After the war, they moved to Canada and after relocating repeatedly to follow her husband's military career, they settled with their family in Montreal. She preferred to stay out of the limelight, out of deference for her husband, who served with the Royal 22nd Regiment, and was a decorated war hero in his own right.

Little did many know she had been made a member of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to the war effort.

Remembered today

Seventy-five years after she jumped into France, she's remembered on the beaches where all those young men landed in her footsteps.

Some of her belongings, including a compact and a cigarette case, are included in a special exhibition, Great Women During the War 1939-1945, at the Juno Beach Centre, developed by the Canadian War Museum, about women who participated in the war.

Both she and her husband Guy have passed away — Sonya d'Artois died in Montreal in 2014 at age of 90.

But members of their family, including Murdoch, have come to Juno Beach from Canada to revive their memory.

D'Artois is depicted as a daring, gutsy agent, but is known to her family only as a loving mother and grandmother.

She was ""very humble and just soft and gentle,"" said granddaughter Michaela d'Artois, 28. ""And I think that's really beautiful to be both: To be very strong and brave. But the most brave thing is to be gentle and soft""

1479,,Covering Conflicts Across The Middle East. Earlier,"While Allied troops were still preparing for one of the largest military operations in history, a 20-year-old woman parachuted into occupied France under the cover of darkness — and injured her back and shoulder.

It was a flawed rendition of the four practice jumps Sonya d'Artois (originally Butt) had under her belt before undertaking the riskiest assignment of her life.

But given the rumours she'd heard about others being shot or captured the moment they landed, her jump on May 29, 1944 — nine days before D-Day — was still a success.

D'Artois's assignment as a secret agent behind those lines was never going to be easy: there were setbacks, mishaps and near misses that nearly cost her life.

But her subsequent accomplishments in helping the French resistance sabotage German efforts, along with the clandestine work of dozens of other female agents, helped the Allied forces make their the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, and ultimately win the Second World War.

CBC special live coverage:

""Never before had so many women been so closely involved in one of the great operations of a major war,"" said British historian Marcus Binney, author of The Women Who Lived For Danger: The Women Agents of S.O.E. in the Second World War.

""Their support for the D-Day landings, in advance of them and after them, was enormous, and was recognized by [Dwight] Eisenhower, by [Winston] Churchill — by everybody.""

'Set Europe ablaze'

D'Artois was one of 3,000 secret warrior women of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE), founded in 1940 at Churchill's request.

The organization, which also employed thousands of men, including many Canadians, was intended, in Churchill's words, to quietly ""set Europe ablaze.""

At 19, D'Artois was one of the youngest recruits, but she ticked many boxes: she was fluent in French, fit and willing to take risks.

D'Artois, shown at Versailles, would socialize with German soldiers at the same time she was co-ordinating ambushes against them while she worked with the French resistance. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

By evading capture and ultimately surviving the war — eventually growing into old age as a Canadian mother and then grandmother — d'Artois had displayed inordinate skill and determination.

They are traits that d'Artois displayed early in life.

After her parents separated, d'Artois lived with her mother in southern France.

When the war erupted, she was a teenager and alone at school while her mother happened to be visiting the U.K. She had no passport or money, and yet she made her way alone across an international border all the way to the U.K.

Reinventing her story

When she returned to France a few years later as a British agent, she once again had to improvise when the container carrying her clothing was discovered by a German patrol in the Le Mans area, likely alerting them to the arrival of a female agent.

She had to reinvent her story — which had her working in the couture business and visiting from Paris.

""We decided once they knew there was a woman there, she'd probably be hiding,"" she said in an interview for a documentary back in 2002.

""So we tried to fool them by not hiding.""

British historian Marcus Binney says the support d'Artois and other women working clandestinely was enormous for the D-Day landings. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

That meant she would frequent black market restaurants and socialize with German soldiers. All the while, the rest of the time, she was co-ordinating ambushes against them.

She was among several examples of women who proved that they were better suited than men for the task of clandestinely operating inside enemy territory.

""If you were in occupied France and you were a young man, they'd say, 'Why aren't you doing your military service, why aren't you doing work service in Germany?' "" said Binney.

""Women could travel more freely and they could be couriers. They could be radio officers or indeed weapons officers.

""They were very courageous.""

Effective instructor

At one time or another in 1944, D'Artois wore all those hats.

Trained at the SOE as an explosives expert, she would prove an effective instructor for French resistance fighters on the ins and outs of destroying rail lines and communications lines. She also covered countless kilometres on bicycle as a courier, recruiter, co-ordinator and intelligence gatherer.

""This was the job that we were there to do,"" she said in the 2002 documentary Behind Enemy Lines: The Real Charlotte Grays.

""We knew the reason for it. It was to harass the Germans and break up their lines of communication and troop movement. Just obstruct them as much as possible.""

D'Artois was identified as Suzanne Bonvie in her fake papers. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

Her code name was Agent Blanche (or sometimes, Madeleine), but her fake papers identified her as Suzanne Bonvie.

More than once, she would have to run a gauntlet of German checkpoints, hoping they weren't on to her.

Once, she said in one interview, she narrowly escaped an assassination attempt meant specifically for her when she decided to avoid a resistance meeting — purely on instinct.

She also once dropped her purse, which contained a pistol, on the floor of one of the restaurants she frequented, risking blowing her cover.

'Perfectly calm'

In the chaos of liberation in 1944, she and a colleague, Sydney Hudson, were shot at, and while he was shot in the shoulder, she escaped unscathed — though her jacket was riddled with bullets.

""I never saw her not have a cool head,"" Hudson, who was her team leader in France, said in the 2002 documentary.

""Whatever the situation was, she remained perfectly calm.""

As a young woman, ""she was a rabble rouser,"" Nadya Murdoch, d'Artois's daughter, said in an interview in Montreal.

""She liked to get into trouble and she did all sorts of things with her brother that got her into trouble.""

She learned how to handle explosives. She learned how to make bombs. She learned how to blow up bridges. - Nadya Murdoch

But in extensive and arduous training in the U.K., where she was treated no differently than the men, she matured quickly, said Murdoch.

""She learned how to handle explosives. She learned how to make bombs. She learned how to blow up bridges. She learned how to pick a lock. She learned how to attack somebody. She learned how to do silent killing.…

""She learned a lot.""

Falling in love

It was also during training in early 1944 that she met Guy d'Artois, a French-Canadian member of the SOE.

Both had decided to specialize in explosives. They were then paired up to go on a mission together and soon became inseparable. They had fallen in love.

They decided to get married just before being deployed to France.

""Then they separated us, we couldn't go on the same mission,"" d'Artois said in that 2002 interview.

Superiors were concerned they would be liable to spill secrets if one of them was captured and tortured in front of the other. So they were deployed to different parts of France hundreds of kilometres apart.

They each did their part preparing for D-Day. In preparation for her mission, d'Artois was issued with a pistol and a suicide pill. She landed in France nine days before D-Day — exactly two weeks after her 20th birthday.

'Quite a lot of damage'

When the parachutes started raining down on Normandy, d'Artois stepped up her team's efforts to sabotage German efforts to move towards Allied troops.

""Never before had so many women been so closely involved in one of the great operations of a major war,"" said British historian Marcus Binney, author of The Women Who Lived For Danger: The Women Agents of S.O.E. in the Second World War.

""Their support for the D-Day landings, in advance of them and after them, was enormous, and was recognized by [Dwight] Eisenhower, by [Winston] Churchill — by everybody.""

'Set Europe ablaze'

D'Artois was one of 3,000 secret warrior women of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE), founded in 1940 at Churchill's request.

The organization, which also employed thousands of men, including many Canadians, was intended, in Churchill's words, to quietly ""set Europe ablaze.""

At 19, D'Artois was one of the youngest recruits, but she ticked many boxes: she was fluent in French, fit and willing to take risks.

By evading capture and ultimately surviving the war — eventually growing into old age as a Canadian mother and then grandmother — d'Artois had displayed inordinate skill and determination.

They are traits that d'Artois displayed early in life.

After her parents separated, d'Artois lived with her mother in southern France.

When the war erupted, she was a teenager and alone at school while her mother happened to be visiting the U.K. She had no passport or money, and yet she made her way alone across an international border all the way to the U.K.

Reinventing her story

When she returned to France a few years later as a British agent, she once again had to improvise when the container carrying her clothing was discovered by a German patrol in the Le Mans area, likely alerting them to the arrival of a female agent.

She had to reinvent her story — which had her working in the couture business and visiting from Paris.

""We decided once they knew there was a woman there, she'd probably be hiding,"" she said in an interview for a documentary back in 2002.

""So we tried to fool them by not hiding.""

British historian Marcus Binney says the support d'Artois and other women working clandestinely was enormous for the D-Day landings. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)

That meant she would frequent black market restaurants and socialize with German soldiers. All the while, the rest of the time, she was co-ordinating ambushes against them.

She was among several examples of women who proved that they were better suited than men for the task of clandestinely operating inside enemy territory.

""If you were in occupied France and you were a young man, they'd say, 'Why aren't you doing your military service, why aren't you doing work service in Germany?' "" said Binney.

""Women could travel more freely and they could be couriers. They could be radio officers or indeed weapons officers.

""They were very courageous.""

Effective instructor

At one time or another in 1944, D'Artois wore all those hats.

Trained at the SOE as an explosives expert, she would prove an effective instructor for French resistance fighters on the ins and outs of destroying rail lines and communications lines. She also covered countless kilometres on bicycle as a courier, recruiter, co-ordinator and intelligence gatherer.

""This was the job that we were there to do,"" she said in the 2002 documentary Behind Enemy Lines: The Real Charlotte Grays.

""We knew the reason for it. It was to harass the Germans and break up their lines of communication and troop movement. Just obstruct them as much as possible.""

D'Artois was identified as Suzanne Bonvie in her fake papers. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

Her code name was Agent Blanche (or sometimes, Madeleine), but her fake papers identified her as Suzanne Bonvie.

More than once, she would have to run a gauntlet of German checkpoints, hoping they weren't on to her.

Once, she said in one interview, she narrowly escaped an assassination attempt meant specifically for her when she decided to avoid a resistance meeting — purely on instinct.

She also once dropped her purse, which contained a pistol, on the floor of one of the restaurants she frequented, risking blowing her cover.

'Perfectly calm'

In the chaos of liberation in 1944, she and a colleague, Sydney Hudson, were shot at, and while he was shot in the shoulder, she escaped unscathed — though her jacket was riddled with bullets.

""I never saw her not have a cool head,"" Hudson, who was her team leader in France, said in the 2002 documentary.

""Whatever the situation was, she remained perfectly calm.""

As a young woman, ""she was a rabble rouser,"" Nadya Murdoch, d'Artois's daughter, said in an interview in Montreal.

""She liked to get into trouble and she did all sorts of things with her brother that got her into trouble.""

She learned how to handle explosives. She learned how to make bombs. She learned how to blow up bridges. - Nadya Murdoch

But in extensive and arduous training in the U.K., where she was treated no differently than the men, she matured quickly, said Murdoch.

""She learned how to handle explosives. She learned how to make bombs. She learned how to blow up bridges. She learned how to pick a lock. She learned how to attack somebody. She learned how to do silent killing.…

""She learned a lot.""

Falling in love

It was also during training in early 1944 that she met Guy d'Artois, a French-Canadian member of the SOE.

Both had decided to specialize in explosives. They were then paired up to go on a mission together and soon became inseparable. They had fallen in love.

They decided to get married just before being deployed to France.

Sonya d'Artois met Guy d'Artois, a French-Canadian member of Britain's Special Operations Executive, during training in early 1944. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

""Then they separated us, we couldn't go on the same mission,"" d'Artois said in that 2002 interview.

Superiors were concerned they would be liable to spill secrets if one of them was captured and tortured in front of the other. So they were deployed to different parts of France hundreds of kilometres apart.

They each did their part preparing for D-Day. In preparation for her mission, d'Artois was issued with a pistol and a suicide pill. She landed in France nine days before D-Day — exactly two weeks after her 20th birthday.

'Quite a lot of damage'

When the parachutes started raining down on Normandy, d'Artois stepped up her team's efforts to sabotage German efforts to move towards Allied troops.

""Because we knew the Allies had landed, we had a lot more confidence to do what we had to do. It was open warfare and we managed to do quite a lot of damage.""

D'Artois was lucky to avoid capture — unlike some of her colleagues who were imprisoned and killed.

When American soldiers came in as liberators in August 1944, she was taken away to have her head shaved to mark her as a collaborator — until her colleagues intervened and vouched for her identity as a British agent.

After the Second World War, d'Artois sailed to Canada, where she and her husband moved repeatedly to follow his military career before settling in Montreal. (Submitted by the d'Artois family)

It would be several more months before she would be reunited with her husband Guy in France.

After the war, they moved to Canada and after relocating repeatedly to follow her husband's military career, they settled with their family in Montreal. She preferred to stay out of the limelight, out of deference for her husband, who served with the Royal 22nd Regiment, and was a decorated war hero in his own right.

Little did many know she had been made a member of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to the war effort.

Remembered today

Seventy-five years after she jumped into France, she's remembered on the beaches where all those young men landed in her footsteps.

Some of her belongings, including a compact and a cigarette case, are included in a special exhibition, Great Women During the War 1939-1945, at the Juno Beach Centre, developed by the Canadian War Museum, about women who participated in the war.

The d'Artois family gathers Tuesday in front of the exhibit honouring Sonya d'Artois at the Juno Beach Centre. (Nahlah Ayed/CBC)

Both she and her husband Guy have passed away — Sonya d'Artois died in Montreal in 2014 at age of 90.

But members of their family, including Murdoch, have come to Juno Beach from Canada to revive their memory.

D'Artois is depicted as a daring, gutsy agent, but is known to her family only as a loving mother and grandmother.

She was ""very humble and just soft and gentle,"" said granddaughter Michaela d'Artois, 28. ""And I think that's really beautiful to be both: To be very strong and brave. But the most brave thing is to be gentle and soft""

Murdoch said of her parents: ""Their courage and their bravery was pretty incredible.""",,"['france', 'learned', 'dartois', 'dday', 'lines', 'submitted', 'war', 'women', '1944', 'german']",,https://www.cbc.ca/life

Piri Piri Chicken, Dressed Potatoes, Rocket Salad and Quick Portuguese Tarts

By Jamie Oliver

Ingredients

Chicken:

4 large chicken thighs, skin on and bone in

1 red pepper

1 yellow pepper

6 sprigs of fresh thyme

Potatoes:

1 medium potato

2 sweet potatoes

½ a lemon

1 fresh red chilli

A bunch of fresh coriander

Piri Piri sauce:

1 red onion

4 cloves of garlic

1–2 bird’s-eye chillies

2 tbsp sweet smoked paprika

2 lemons

4 tbsp white wine vinegar

2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

A large bunch of fresh basil

Salad:

1 x 100g bag of prewashed wild rocket

½ a lemon

Seasonings:

Olive oil

Extra virgin olive oil

Sea salt & black pepper

Tarts:

Plain flour, for dusting

1 x 375g pack of pre-rolled puff pastry

Ground cinnamon

125g crème fraîche

1 egg

1 tsp vanilla paste or vanilla extract

5 tbsp golden caster sugar

1 orange

Preparation

To start: Get all your ingredients and equipment ready. Turn the oven on to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Put a large griddle pan on a high heat.

Chicken: Put the chicken thighs on a plastic chopping board, skin side down, and slash the meat on each one a few times. Drizzle with olive oil and season, then put on the griddle pan that is heating up, skin side down. Cook until golden underneath, then turn over. Wash your hands.

Tarts: Dust a clean surface with flour. Unroll the sheet of pastry, then cut it in half so you end up with two 20 x 20cm squares of pastry (put one in the fridge for another day). Sprinkle over a few good pinches of ground cinnamon, then roll the pastry into a Swiss roll shape and cut into 6 rounds. Put these into 6 of the holes in a muffin tin, and use your thumbs to stretch and mould the pastry into the holes (just like in the picture) so the bottom is flat and the pastry comes up to the top. Put on the top shelf of the oven and cook for around 8 to 10 minutes (set the timer), or until lightly golden.

Potatoes: Wash the potato and sweet potatoes and halve lengthways. Put them into a large microwave-safe bowl with ½ a lemon. Cover with clingfilm and put into the microwave on full power for 15 minutes.

Chicken: Turn the chicken over.

Tarts: Spoon the crème fraîche into a small bowl. Add the egg, vanilla paste or extract, 1 tablespoon of golden caster sugar and the zest of 1 orange. Mix well.

Piri Piri sauce: Peel and roughly chop the red onion and add to the liquidizer with 4 peeled cloves of garlic. Add the chilies (stalks removed), 2 tablespoons of paprika, the zest of 2 lemons and juice of 1 lemon. Add 4 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, a good pinch of salt & pepper, the bunch of basil and a swig of water. Blitz until smooth.

Chicken: Slice the peppers into strips and add to the griddle pan. Turn the heat down to medium and keep moving the peppers around.

Tarts: Take the muffin tin out of the oven, and use a teaspoon to press the puffed up pastry back to the sides and make room for the filling. Spoon the crème fraîche mixture into the tart cases, and return to the top shelf of the oven. Set the timer for 8 minutes.

Chicken: Pour the piri piri sauce into a snug-fitting roasting tray. Lay the peppers on top and put aside. Add the chicken to the roasting tray with the sauce. Scatter over the sprigs of thyme, then put the tray into the middle of the oven.

Tarts: Put a small saucepan on a high heat. Squeeze in the juice from the zested orange and add 4 tablespoons of golden caster sugar. Stir and keep a good eye on it, but remember caramel can burn badly so don’t touch or taste.

Potatoes: Finely chop the red chili and most of the coriander on a board, mixing as you go. Add the feta and keep chopping and mixing.

Chicken: Take the tarts out of the oven and move the chicken up to the top shelf to cook for around 10 minutes, or until cooked through.

Tarts: Pour some caramel over each tart (they’ll still be wobbly, but that’s good). Put aside to set.

Salad: Quickly dress the rocket, still in its bag, with extra virgin olive oil, a good pinch of salt & pepper and the juice of ½ a lemon. Tip into a bowl and take to the table.

Potatoes: Check the potatoes are cooked through, then use tongs to squeeze over the cooked lemon. Add the coriander mixture from the chopping board and mix everything together. Season, then take to the table.

To serve: Get the tray of chicken out of the oven, sprinkle over a few coriander leaves and take straight to the table.

Yield: Makes 4 servings (with 2 tarts left over)

While many of us would jump at the chance to have the heavenly scent of freshly baked bread fill our homes every Sunday morning, the thought of making it all on our own can feel intimidating to say the least. That’s why we love this primer from Holly Davis’ cookbook Ferment. Not only does she share a simple recipe for a rye sourdough starter, she breaks down every step in baking process that follows, from resting to rising to storing those finished loaves. See below for Davis’ notes on how to make and nurture your starter, then keep scrolling for the tips that’ll help bring you the best bread every time.

Making Rye Starter from Scratch

By Holly Davis

It takes 2–3 weeks of daily care to nurture flour and water into vibrant activity, but once you have done this, your starter could become a part of your legacy. I made mine in a class with Australia’s master baker John Downes in 1986 and I gift it freely and have introduced it to numerous other bakers’ starters since. If you forget to feed the mix for a day or two, the sourness will greatly increase. This is because you are favoring lactobacilli at the expense of yeasts.

Ingredients

2 ¾ oz (75 g) water

1 ¾ oz (50 g) biodynamic or organic whole-grain rye flour

Preparation

In a spotlessly clean, large nonreactive ceramic or glass bowl, combine the water and flour, and whisk to a smooth batter. Notice how the mix smells.

Cover with a clean dish towel or cheesecloth and let it stand at room temperature, ideally 73–82°F (23–28°C), for 24 hours.

The next day, stir, smell, and re-cover.

Each day for the next 10–14 days, discard all but 1 tablespoon of the mixture (see box on p. 170). Sniff the mixture and taste – it should start to smell and taste slightly sour and eventually quite fruity and effervescent as it becomes alive with yeast activity. Put the reserved tablespoon of starter in a clean bowl and feed the starter by adding 2½ oz (75 g) water and 1¾ oz (50 g) biodynamic or organic rye flour. Mix together well, making sure the flour is well incorporated. Cover and leave for 6–10 hours.

Repeat the process once or twice a day for 5–7 more days, or until the mix has a fruity, “yeasty” smell and it is filled with lots of large gas bubbles. Put in a glass jar (only ever half fill the jar), cover with a clean cloth or piece of cheesecloth, and secure.

After feeding the starter, note the level in the jar. At the next feeding, you should see a “tide mark” showing that the starter rose and then fell. The starter is ready to use when it reliably doubles in volume over a 6- to 10-hour period at room temperature.

When ready, your active starter can be used as it is or to create a larger volume of active leaven.

If you’re not baking regularly, keep your starter in a small, clean glass jar with a lid on in the fridge. A day or two before using your starter, take it out of the fridge and feed it every 6 hours until vibrant and active. A cold, sleepy starter that has not been used in over a week may need three or four feeds to return to a suitable activity level to leaven your recipes.

Yield: Makes 4 ½ oz (125 g), ready in 14-21 days

Sourdough know-how: Making bread

Now that you have an active starter/leaven, you can make your own bread whenever you like. This recipe is also versatile in another way: bakers refer to loaves by the amount of flour to water used – this is called the baker’s percentage. The total amount of flour is 100%, and the water is described as a percentage relative to that. My recipe is 70% hydration, which produces a very sticky dough. If you are new to bread baking, you can reduce the percentage of water to 60% hydration, which you will find easier to handle. To do this, reduce the total amount of water to 11½ oz (330 g). This gives you 10 oz (280 g) to add to the flour and leaven, and 1¾ oz (50 g) to dissolve the salt.

Resting dough

The baker’s term for the initial resting of a dough is “autolyse.” After the leaven has been mixed with flour and water to form a shaggy dough, and before any salt is added or kneading done (which could oxidize the dough), it is left to sit. During this time, the flour absorbs the water and becomes fully hydrated, helping all-important gluten formation during the next steps. Enzymes in the flour also break down the starches into simple sugars, which become food for the yeasts in the leaven during bulk fermentation, helping to make the bread lighter.

The autolyse step is frequently skipped, but it makes a huge difference in the structure, texture, and overall color, flavor, and digestibility of your bread, and it makes it easier to handle and shape.

The warmer the spot, the faster the rise and the more sour the loaf. Slow-rising develops a more complex flavor and a sweeter, more digestible loaf.

Slow-rising

Letting your dough rise very slowly in the fridge is a very handy option for fitting home-baked bread into a busy lifestyle. Simply put the dough in a clean, preferably glass container (with a tight-fitting lid) that is large enough for the dough to expand by about a third. Refrigerate for up to 2 days and bake when time permits. Keeping the dough in the fridge merely slows down fermentation, allowing it to gently proof and transform into a more digestible and delicious form. The dough will be cold when you retrieve it and the microbes will be sleepy. Bring the dough back to room temperature, then shape it as per the recipe, cover it in a clean, damp cloth, and let it rise for 1½–3 hours before baking.

Shaping and slashing dough

Creating structure in dough comes about through the development of the gluten when folding and turning or kneading and in the final shaping.

Proofing baskets give support and shape to loaves during their final rise before baking. You could also use a colander or mixing bowl. Either way, line with a clean linen dish towel and coat it generously with flour. Rub the flour into the towel to prevent the dough from sticking.

When properly leavened dough hits the intense heat of the oven, any remaining active yeasts make their last hurrah and cause the dough to rise further. Slashing the dough just before putting it in the oven directs the expansion and prevents it from bursting randomly.

When you make a cut in a leavened dough, the instrument needs to be razor sharp, otherwise the dough gets dragged and ugly lumps ensue. Use a special baker’s lame (pronounced “lahm”) or grignette, a one-edged razor blade, or a super-sharp tomato knife or pair of scissors. You can decorate dough by slashing it in a random or uniform pattern and, if you are baking several types at once, to tell them apart.

Baking in Dutch ovens

A round or oval cast-iron pot with a lid (Dutch oven) creates the perfect conditions for steam-baked loaves. In lieu of that, a clay pot does the trick. These vessels simulate the effects of a wood-fired oven by steaming the loaf during the first period of baking, which ensures a good rise from the dough and allows it to develop a well-caramelized thin, crisp crust. If you don’t have one, you can use any cast-iron pot with heatproof handles and a lid, which will effectively transfer the heat; at these temperatures a stainless-steel pot will burn your bread.

Storing bread

I find loaves keep best, for up to a week, wrapped in a cotton cloth or bag. To revitalize a loaf, spritz with water and bake at 400°F (200°C) for 10 minutes or slice and toast. Alternatively, make a large batch of bread and slice and freeze what you won’t use within a few days, storing it in freezer-safe plastic bags.

Essential equipment

a wide firm or flexible plastic or metal scraper

2–3 tightly woven linen cloths

9 in (23 cm) round or 13¼ in (33 cm) rectangular proofing baskets or deep bowls, each lined with a well-floured linen cloth

a razor blade, baker’s lame, or tomato knife, for slashing the dough

a spray bottle, for misting the oven

Tips

Before you start to make a loaf, gather everything you will need.

For ease of access, keep a little extra flour in a bowl to use for dusting.

Keep a jug of tepid water on hand in case you need extra.

Scrape any dough off your counter and utensils and give them a rinse in hot water before the dough has a chance to dry, making them easier to clean later.

1485,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"Legislators in Washington State just signed a new bill into law making it legal for people to compost their bodies upon death rather than choosing a more traditional funerary practice such as burial or cremation.

Advocates of the procedure suggest it could be a more environmentally benign way to dispose of human remains.

The driving force behind the human composting movement in the U.S. is Katrina Spade. She founded a company called Recompose to develop the idea.

Space said in a TED Talk the inspiration to develop the idea of human composting came when she got a call from a friend.

""She was like, 'Hey, have you heard about the farmers who are composting whole cows?' And I was like, 'Hmm…,'"" Spade said. ""[It] turns out that farmers and agricultural institutions have been practising something called livestock mortality composting for decades.""

This is a procedure used to dispose of the carcasses of animals that have died and can't be sold for human consumption.

Spade then turned to Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, professor of soil science and sustainable agriculture at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington. Carpenter-Boggs had been studying livestock mortality composting for about 20 years.

It was a very fine compost that was relatively stable, [and] it smelled good. - Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, Washington State University

""I had seen what this process is capable of doing with whole cows and horses,"" said Carpenter-Boggs — now also the scientific advisor for Recompose — in conversation with Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald. ""Anyone who's done this and seen how effective it can be has kind of had the inkling that this could have wider use.""

Carpenter-Boggs and her team conducted a pilot study with six human cadavers to test the conditions that would be required to turn a dead body into soil in a timely manner. They're calling this process for humans, ""natural organic reduction.""

How this works with animals

To compost a whole farm animal, the body is placed within layers of organic materials like hay, silage and even manure. Microbes present in the organic material release enzymes that break down organic materials like muscle and fat. The process produces heat, which accelerates the microbial action.

""In composting, it is quite different than other types of decomposition in that you need enough material and the right combination of materials that you are promoting extremely high levels of microbial activity,"" said Carpenter-Boggs.

This soil can then be used to grow new life. Eventually you could be a lemon tree. - Katrina Spade, Recompose

Within a few months, the microorganisms turn the dead animal and the organic material that was added to it into pathogen-free, fertile compost.

The process for humans

Spade said in her TED Talk that she imagines the process could be part of a ritual that would give back to the earth.

""When someone dies, their body is taken to a human composting facility,"" she said. ""After wrapping the deceased in a simple shroud, friends and family carry the body to the top of the core which contains the natural decomposition system""

Carpenter-Boggs said, compared to what they do for livestock, the procedure for composting human remains would have to be modified in order to speed the process up and reduce the cost.

It would be done in a contained vessel which would give them more control of the process. The vessel would be rotated to provide physical disruption so oxygen could access all parts of the composting material. This would also help control the moisture level.

What organic material they would add to the vessel to facilitate composting would depend on what's locally available.

""Some things that have been used in our trials, and in other material composting, would be things like wood chips, hay, grains — really any type of organic materials can be used,"" she said.

Katrina Spade, upper left, the founder and CEO of Recompose, a company that hopes to use composting as an alternative to burying or cremating human remains, looks on Tuesday, May 21, 2019, as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, centre, signs a bill into law at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash., that allows licensed facilities to offer ""natural organic reduction,"" which turns a body into soil in a span of several weeks. (Ted S. Warren/AP Photo)

Quality of compost from humans

Carpenter-Boggs said she was very pleased with the quality of compost that came out of her human cadaver studies.

""By the time we completed our trials, we were developing material that was very pleasant to handle, it was a very fine compost that was relatively stable, [and] it smelled good,"" she said.

One of the questions is how the compost might be used. Spade said in her TED Talk that ""this soil can then be used to grow new life. Eventually you could be a lemon tree.""

Carpenter-Boggs said that they were looking into using it in conservation areas or memorial gardens.

Regulators in Washington State are now sorting out the finer details of how this will work, but Recompose hopes this will be a service people will be able to access by late 2020.

Spade said this will just be the beginning: ""Our Seattle facility will function as a model for these places all over the world. We've heard from communities in South Africa, Australia, the UK, Canada and beyond.""

In Canada, there are services offering green burials where bodies are not embalmed, but are instead buried in a simple shroud or wooden box. Depending on the burial environment, however, parts of the body may never decompose. In two provinces — Ontario and Quebec — people can opt for a service called alkaline hydrolysis, which dissolves the soft tissues of the body leaving only bone and teeth.","The driving force behind the human composting movement in the U.S. is Katrina Spade.

Black Rice Pudding with Mango, Lime, Passion Fruit & Coconut

By Jamie Oliver

Ingredients

200g black rice

1 ripe mango

1 lime

1 tbsp blanched hazelnuts

1 tbsp coconut flakes

2 ripe bananas

1 tbsp vanilla extract

Manuka honey, optional

4 heaped tbsp natural yogurt

2 wrinkly passion fruit

Preparation

Cook the black rice according to the packet instructions, overcooking it slightly so it’s plump and sticky, then drain and cool. Meanwhile, peel and destone the mango, blitz the flesh in a blender with the lime juice until smooth, and pour into a bowl. Separately, toast the hazelnuts and coconut in a dry frying pan until lightly golden, then bash up in a pestle and mortar.

Peel the bananas and tear into the blender, then blitz with the hazelnut milk, vanilla extract and two-thirds of the black rice — depending on the sweetness of your bananas, you could also add a teaspoon of honey. Once smooth, stir that back through the rest of the rice — this will give you great texture and colour. Divide between four nice jars or bowls. Spoon over the blitzed mango, squeeze half a passion fruit over each one, then delicately spoon over the yogurt and sprinkle with the hazelnuts and coconut.

Yield: Makes 4 servings

No matter how busy you are, you'll find that healthy eating ‘the Jamie way’ is both simple and achievable, making it super-easy to choose exactly the kind of meals that suit you.

1488,The Caregivers’ Club: Caring For The Caregiver: How To Prevent Burnout,Nira Rittenberg,"By Nira Rittenberg

As Canada’s population ages, the number of caregivers who are involved in dementia care is on the rise. The latest statistics from the Alzheimer Society show that there are 25,000 new cases of dementia every year and by 2031, the number of cases will increase 66% from today.

Individuals with dementia often require quite a lot of care, and it's usually the family that provides it. CBC documentary, The Caregivers' Club profiles three Ontario families as they struggle to care for their loved ones.

Caregivers for People with Dementia Burnout More Often

Caregiving is challenging, and people with dementia often require long care hours. This type of caregiving is associated with higher levels of burnout than non-dementia caregiving. Research has shown that it is much more difficult to do than caring for someone with a physical disability.



For almost all carers there is the balancing act of family life, careers and other relationships. Some caregiver demographics, such as homosexual, Indigenous and caregivers of individuals with early onset dementia, may experience additional stressors in their roles. Each of these caregiver groups has challenges that are specific to their situation.

Early onset dementia caregivers are often in the phase of life where they are raising younger children and carry more of a financial burden. They may have not fully developed their caregiving skills and feel more unprepared for the task. Homosexual caregivers often have to deal with prejudice and lack of sensitivity in the healthcare system; while Indigenous populations may not have access to mental health services.

Stress Warning Signs

The stresses of caregiving can be insidious and often trace back to the caregiver neglecting their own mental and physical health. These triggers may happen slowly and make burnout hard to identify.



Some warning signs include:



• You are not enjoying social activities and friends

• You find it a chore to leave the house

• You are more irritable and have mood changes

• It is difficult to concentrate and get things done

• You are having trouble sleeping

• Your weight may be affected (up or down)

• You feel anxious or depressed

• You have physical complaints such as headaches, pains

• You get sick more often, with both minor and major ailments

Caregiving Will Not Change the Course of the Dementia

Some caregivers feel the self-imposed responsibility that their efforts can somehow change the course of the illness by keeping the individual with dementia “happy and healthy.” Many caregivers report that they end up feeling upset with the person they are caring for. Though they are aware that feeling this way is not rational, it makes them feel worse.



Many caregivers saddle themselves with unrealistic expectations of what they can handle on a daily or practical level. Money, resources and ability to manage may not be adequate and can make a caregiver feel impotent. The lack of ability to control this situation combined with a complex health care system can be difficult and frustrating.



Fortunately, not all symptoms occur for every caregiver, and there is no timeline on when they will feel that things are not working.

How to Access Support for Caregivers

The good news is research has shown that support can make things easier for caregivers.

Interventions can come in different forms like receiving help to get things done and assistance with housework, bathing or other tasks.



The caregiver also needs support to deal with the stress of watching someone they care about deteriorate to help them cope with the emotional struggles that are part of the journey.

These supports can come from both professionals as well as peer caregivers. Every situation is different and supports should be built around need. There are a variety of services and resources that can help. The key is to find one that suits your family.



Reach out to your doctor or your local health agency. Find someone who will help your family to find what it needs to get the care, education and support to be both effective and healthy.

1489,Bee Nation: How Does Learning to Spell Prepare Children for Life?,Christopher Dart,"By Christopher Dart

What’s the point of spelling bees? In an age where we have spell-checkers, apps like Grammarly, autocorrect and predictive spelling, why should we make children, such as those featured in the documentary Bee Nation, spend hours learning how to spell words? Wouldn’t they be better off learning to code?

According to Julie Spence, founder and director of the National Spelling Bee of Canada, children should learn to spell not just because it improves their literacy level, but because it helps grow their brains. It teaches them life skills, and has spin-off benefits for their families and communities.

The Story Behind Canada’s all-First Nations Spelling Bee

Spence founded the bee in 1987. She says she started the bee after hearing then-Ontario Education Minister Sean Conway asking parents to take a more active role in their children’s education. Spence had fond memories of taking part in spelling bees in her native Jamaica.

“I remember back home in Jamaica, how much it brought the community together,” she says. “How much you know, they’re rooting for you; they’re cheering you on. And then [adults] would tell you ‘Well, I could have never spelled that word.’”

A group effort

Thirty years later, she says, parents still form the backbone of Canadian spelling bees, from school bees, through regionals, right up to the national level. She adds that often an entire family will get involved in helping a student prepare for the bee.

“When you have a sibling that’s in a bee, everybody gets involved with the coaching,” she says. “Grandma, grandpa, sisters, brothers, everybody. Because they know you’re going up, it’s a competition. And here is one program that they all can get involved with. They’re going to throw words at you from different angles, just to prepare you. So we’re really seeing that at the dinner table, you know after supper, during supper, reading the newspaper, they’ll see a word and think ‘Hmm, maybe you’ll get that in the tiebreaker round.’”

We have the children write about their unsung hero. And the person that they most times write about is their teacher who helped them, their grandparent or their brother or their sister or a mum. It really brings the family together.”

Building confidence, asking questions

Beyond the benefits to the family, Spence also points out that learning to spell has huge benefits for students’ academic development.

“It improves their writing skills,” she says. “Their vocabulary. They’re able to think, not just memorize.”

Recently, one of her students had been asking for the words, definition and sentence to be repeated over and over. “I said to her, ‘What was that?’ And she said, ‘Well I had to think my way through.’ Because there are some words that sound so similar and I had to be absolutely sure.’ So that’s part of development. “

“We’re teaching them to be able to ask questions at some very early stage. For instance, if they have a word, they can ask questions about the word. It helps them to build confidence.”

And unlike spelling itself, no app can replace that.","By Christopher DartWhat’s the point of spelling bees?

1491,CBC Radio,Bob Mcdonald Is The Host Of Cbc Radio'S Award-Winning Weekly Science Program,"Scientists in Germany have applied machine learning to model the weakening of the jet stream that is partly responsible for extreme weather events, including the long cold winter of 2019 that held much of North America and Europe in an icy grip.

It's a strange irony that the warming of the Arctic has been bringing colder winters to regions farther south. This is partly due to a change in the jet stream, a river of air flowing at hundreds of km/h high up in the stratosphere that runs all the way around the northern hemisphere. It marks the boundary between the mass of cold Arctic air that caps the top of our planet and the warmer air around the middle.

Battleground between hot and cold air

The jet stream is the battleground between these two air masses as the warm air tries to move north and the colder pushes south. This boundary line is constantly moving, and like all rivers, the jet stream meanders, sometimes wandering south, allowing the cold air to drop down to the mid-latitudes, which happened last winter, or it can curve northwards, bringing warm air up from the tropics, producing hot, dry periods.

The winter of 2019 brought some colder-than-usual temperatures to North America, including Victoria, BC as seen in this photo, thanks to the weakening jet stream. (Chad Hipolito/THE CANADIAN PRESS)

The jet stream can also do the opposite, depending on when the meandering happens. If it flows north in January, we get a warmer winter. And if it dips south in July, we have a cool, wet summer.

Storm systems also tend to follow the jet stream, so it has a strong effect on the weather patterns for the entire continent.

A meandering jet stream

In recent years, the weakening of the jet stream has been in part due to increased warming in the Arctic, so there is less temperature difference between the northern and southern air masses.

This has also made the stream meander more north and south — producing extra-long cold snaps and hot summers to the mid-latitudes. The effect has been known for some time, but predicting how it will change in the future has been difficult.

Scientists at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany have developed a new computer model to understand the complex interactions in the atmosphere that are affecting the jet stream. The model incorporates the warming effect of ice loss in the Arctic, as well as chemical interactions with the ozone layer.

As white ice melts away, the exposed land and sea water absorb sunlight more easily, releasing heat into the air close to the ground. Meanwhile, at the top of the atmosphere, chemical reactions are taking place as sunlight breaks apart oxygen to produce ozone, our natural filter from the sun's ultraviolet light.

In recent times, there has been more mixing in the atmospheric layers so the ozone effect is amplifying the warming that occurs on the ground at higher altitudes. In other words, the atmosphere in the Arctic is being warmed from the top and the bottom, and that is somehow weakening the jet stream, affecting weather to the south.

Climate model that incorporates machine learning

Climate models in the past did not include the ozone amplifying effect, so the new system will provide a more accurate representation by using an artificial intelligence algorithm called SWIFT that takes into account the complex chemical and physical effects taking place in the ozone layer.

The goal is to better predict the movement of the jet stream and how it might evolve in the future. The shape of the jet stream has impacted many aspects of our weather, from forest fire seasons in the west to tornadoes in the south. These effects are predicted to continue into the future, so a better understanding of the behaviour of the invisible river of air flowing above our heads may help us adapt.","It marks the boundary between the mass of cold Arctic air that caps the top of our planet and the warmer air around the middle.

1496,CBC Radio,Bob Mcdonald Rss Feed,"Scientists in Germany have applied machine learning to model the weakening of the jet stream that is partly responsible for extreme weather events, including the long cold winter of 2019 that held much of North America and Europe in an icy grip.

It's a strange irony that the warming of the Arctic has been bringing colder winters to regions farther south. This is partly due to a change in the jet stream, a river of air flowing at hundreds of km/h high up in the stratosphere that runs all the way around the northern hemisphere. It marks the boundary between the mass of cold Arctic air that caps the top of our planet and the warmer air around the middle.

Battleground between hot and cold air

The jet stream is the battleground between these two air masses as the warm air tries to move north and the colder pushes south. This boundary line is constantly moving, and like all rivers, the jet stream meanders, sometimes wandering south, allowing the cold air to drop down to the mid-latitudes, which happened last winter, or it can curve northwards, bringing warm air up from the tropics, producing hot, dry periods.

The jet stream can also do the opposite, depending on when the meandering happens. If it flows north in January, we get a warmer winter. And if it dips south in July, we have a cool, wet summer.

Storm systems also tend to follow the jet stream, so it has a strong effect on the weather patterns for the entire continent.

A meandering jet stream

In recent years, the weakening of the jet stream has been in part due to increased warming in the Arctic, so there is less temperature difference between the northern and southern air masses.

This has also made the stream meander more north and south — producing extra-long cold snaps and hot summers to the mid-latitudes. The effect has been known for some time, but predicting how it will change in the future has been difficult.

Scientists at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany have developed a new computer model to understand the complex interactions in the atmosphere that are affecting the jet stream. The model incorporates the warming effect of ice loss in the Arctic, as well as chemical interactions with the ozone layer.

As white ice melts away, the exposed land and sea water absorb sunlight more easily, releasing heat into the air close to the ground. Meanwhile, at the top of the atmosphere, chemical reactions are taking place as sunlight breaks apart oxygen to produce ozone, our natural filter from the sun's ultraviolet light.

In recent times, there has been more mixing in the atmospheric layers so the ozone effect is amplifying the warming that occurs on the ground at higher altitudes. In other words, the atmosphere in the Arctic is being warmed from the top and the bottom, and that is somehow weakening the jet stream, affecting weather to the south.

1500,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"A Louisiana city councillor is working to repeal a law in her city that outlaws ""saggy pants"" — which almost exclusively targets young black men — after a fatal police chase.

On Feb. 5, Anthony Childs died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound during a police chase. It started after a police officer saw that he was in violation of the law.

Since 2007, the town of Shreveport has enforced an ordinance which prohibits wearing pants below the waist in public. It is punishable by a $100 US fine and eight hours of community service.

LeVette Fuller spoke with As It Happens host Carol Off about why she is working to repeal the law. Here is part of that conversation.

Why do you want to repeal this ""saggy pants"" law?

I'd completely forgotten that it was on the books until a group of people who were challenging ... findings of a police involved shooting that ended in the death of a civilian.

And they came to the city council meeting and said that this gentleman was originally detained by the police because he was in violation of a sagging pants ordinance.

What happened to Anthony Childs?

Anthony was in his neighborhood on one of the main streets and ... I believe he noticed that the police officer saw him and he took off running.

It seems that he manoeuvred toward a gun that he had on him, took the gun out. The police officer is said to have told him to put the gun down and they ended up engaging in gunfire.

LeVette Fuller, a Shreveport councilwoman, has moved to repeal the saggy pants ordinance, which almost exclusively targets young black men. (Submitted by Shannon Palmer)

And according to the reports, Anthony Childs's fatal wound was self-inflicted. But the police officer shot his gun about eight or nine times.

He was being pursued by the police officer because he had been stopped for having saggy pants. Is that right?

That is the report that was given to the citizens group that wants to have a citizens' review board in our city for police activity.

In February, after Mr. Childs was found out dead, the reason for the stop wasn't told. They kept it under lock for a while. So it's only been after a couple of months that they've come out and said that's a reason for the stop was that he was in violation of the sagging pants ordinance.

And what is that?

In hip hop culture, it became stylish to wear your pants low, sometimes with a baggy T-shirt.

It's distasteful mostly to older generations. I don't particularly care for it … but people found it so distasteful, they felt that the only way they can control it is through the legal system.

What did you discover about who has been stopped for a ""saggy pants"" ordinance?

I discovered that 96 per cent of the stops that ended with a citation were African-American and the majority of those were men. There might have been a couple of women and then the rest of the percentage would be Hispanic or white.

And then with juvenile cases, 100 per cent were African-American.

How often was this ordinance used as the pretext for stopping somebody in order to racially profile them?

Based on the narrative I've received from our police chief, I'm being led to believe that quite a few more where there was no citation for saggy pants … but then there was some other charge after that.

So they would be stopped for this ordinance, which carries with it a fine and community service. But somehow this ordinance would lead to a warrant and would lead to ending up doing time. How did that happen?

What's interesting is that there is an amendment on the original law in 2007 ... that this law should not be used as a pretext. So I don't know when this started.

But the original stop would happen, and then they would find usually guns, like a stop-and-frisk would occur, and that would be what the final warrant might be for.

What is now going to happen with this law in Shreveport?

Well, we have had our initial reading to put it on the agenda. And [soon] we will vote either in favour of the repeal or against the repeal.

I believe that I have the votes to repeal it. And our mayor supports the repeal as well.

What kind of response are you getting?

I'm getting mostly a positive response, but of course the things that stand out are the negative comments that you get. I've received voicemail messages from as far away as New York City, people asking how I would like it if they ran down my street or my mother's street in their underwear.

But for the most part I'm hearing a lot of positive feedback. People that don't like it, but they feel that this is potentially a violation of people's constitutional rights.

The theme from The Big Bang Theory was written by Ed Robertson of the Barenaked Ladies.

The band was performing in LA and Ed ad-libbed a song about the universe on stage that night, which was inspired by a book he had just read called The Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe by Simon Singh.

Unbeknownst to Ed Robertson, sitcom creator Chuck Lorre was in the audience. That's when he decided to ask The Barenaked Ladies to record the theme song to the new sitcom he was developing - called The Big Bang Theory.

Ed wrote it in the shower one day, exactly one-half hour before he was scheduled to play it over the phone to Chuck Lorre.

Big Bang Theory creator, Chuck Lorre.

Lorre loved it and the rest is sitcom history.

The Big Bang Theory will go down in history as one of the highest rated, most-loved sitcoms of all time. Nearly 18 million people tuned into the series finale.

Over its 12-year run, the show contained lots of little Easter eggs and ongoing gags that loyal fans loved. But one of the most interesting occurred at the end of every episode.

Right after the credits, a quick card with some writing on it would flash by. The card would only last one second - not nearly long enough to read it.

At first glance, it looked like fine print. Like a typical network disclaimer. But it wasn't. It was a message from Chuck Lorre. It simply said: ""The end.""

The cast of The Big Bang Theory. (Courtesy of CTV)

Lorre wrote a different message at the end of every single episode of The Big Bang Theory. As a matter of fact, he wrote those one-second cards at the end of all the sitcoms he created beginning in 1995 - including Grace Under Fire, Two and a Half Men, Mike & Molly and Dharma & Greg.

Here's the very first card Lorre wrote for the end of the first Dharma & Greg episode.

""Thanks for videotaping Dharma & Greg and for freeze framing on my video card."" Then he went on to muse that the Law of Karma didn't apply to people in Hollywood because good things happen to bad people all the time. He said Larry was the most underrated of the Three Stooges. He believed beer was a gateway drug that lead to vodka. He said what doesn't kill us, makes us bitter. And he said when the network reads this card, he was going to be in big trouble.

Card #412 at the end of Two and a Half Men said:

""Do not attempt to replicate what you saw in tonight's episode of Two and a Half Men. Despite the seeming lack of serious consequences and regardless of the hilarity that ensued, this is extremely dangerous behaviour that could result in injury or death. Please keep in mind that we employ a highly-paid Hollywood professional who has years of experience with putting his life at risk. And sadly, no, I'm not talking about our stunt man.""

Charlie Sheen in Two and a Half Men.

Clearly, he wasn't above taking a jab at his leading man, Charlie Sheen.

Another card just said: ""Nothing to read here. Move along.""

Still another listed the words that confuse the CBS censors. Like ""Cockamamie, kumquat, insertion, rectify, gherkin, titter, Dick Butkus and the always bewildering lickety-split.""

That one was actually censored by the network censors.

The cards contained Lorre's philosophy of life, his failings, his kids, his health and he even wrote his own 457-word eulogy. In a one-second card.

He eventually collected 333 of his split-second messages (including the censored ones) and compiled them into a big coffee-table book with a title stolen from his very first Dharma & Greg card: What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Bitter.

In the foreword of that book, Chuck Lorre explains his vanity-card mission.

It was to use prime-time television to chronicle an unraveling life and raveling career in subliminal, one-second, hard-to-read increments.

1502,CBC Radio,Out In The Open,"Growing up in Detroit, Mich., Rebecca Kiessling didn't feel an easy sense of belonging. She stuck out within her adoptive family ー a tall blond amid distinctly shorter, brunette parents.

""My mom would make us matching clothes just so people would know I belonged to her,"" Kiessling told Out in the Open host Piya Chattopadhyay.

Kiessling yearned for a sense of place that she felt would come from knowing her birth parents. So upon turning 18, she accessed her adoption record.

In it, she found her birth mother's name and other details. But the field marked ""Father"" only read, ""Caucasian of large build.""

Catapulted into chaos

Kiessling reached out to her birth mother and arranged an in-person meeting. It was then she discovered the disturbing story behind those mysterious four words.

""I learned that [my birth mother] had been abducted at knifepoint by a serial rapist,"" she said.

Kiessling was conceived as a result of that rape.

As a kid, Rebecca Kiessling often felt out of place, and as though she didn't belong with her adoptive family. (Submitted by Rebecca Kiessling)

Her birth mother also disclosed that she had twice tried to terminate the pregnancy, but wasn't able to access a safe abortion, which was illegal in her state at that time.

Kiessling was stunned. Instead of the roots she'd yearned for, she found her life catapulted into chaos.

""Now, all of a sudden, I had these genes, "" Kiessling said. ""I had to sort out: What does that mean about who I am? If I give birth to a son someday would he become a rapist?""

There was more to cope with.

Police had never located a suspect. No one had been charged for the crime. And with no chance of conviction and the statute of limitations up, police records had been destroyed.

So Kiessling believed there was no chance she'd ever know her biological father's identity. She'd never be able to look him in the eye, or allow a chance for him to explain himself.

Despite it all, she yearned to meet him

Rebecca Kiessling, left, seen here with one of her newfound genetic cousins, Nikki. (Submitted by Rebecca Kiessling)

Kiessling, who's now 49, says that over the years, people often asked if she would still want to meet her biological father, if possible.

Her answer was always: ""Well, yeah. I would want to know family history. I would want to know, is there anything I need to know genetics-wise?""

She wondered whether she had genetic half-siblings on her paternal side. But those curiosities remained hypothetical.

Kiessling struggled to make sense of it all. She forged connections with others who had been conceived as a result of rape. She became a lawyer and a committed Christian, leaning on her faith to help find her way.

She married, and had children. She also became an anti-abortion activist, arguing against laws that allow abortions in the case of rape.

The prospect of finding answers in DNA testing

Then, along came a game-changer ー cheap and easily accessible at-home DNA testing.

""I spit in a tube and sent it in,"" she recalled.

Within hours of getting her results, she says she was able to identify several paternal relatives including three men: two of her biological uncles, and the man she'd been seeking.

Time passed. She followed the men on social media. Cousin matches kept popping up in her family tree as more genetic relatives mailed away their saliva.

Eventually, Kiessling knocked on the front door of one of the three brothers. He was ""the one who was always smiling in his Facebook photos,"" Kiessling explained. ""He seemed nice.""

The man welcomed her. A DNA test confirmed he was Kiessling's biological uncle. From him, she learned more about the man who had raped her mother: he'd never been to jail, never been arrested; he had a wife and two children, one of whom had died a decade earlier.

Kiessling learned his wife had been newly pregnant at the time of her mother's rape.

After taking time to digest it all, she endeavoured to meet him. But the meeting never happened.

'I'll look in his casket someday'

In her pursuit of connection with paternal relatives, Kiessling has been welcomed by some and not by others. She and one cousin in particular have become close. And she says she's forging a new relationship with her genetic half-brother.

But Kiessling has decided she no longer wishes to meet her biological father, who's developed Alzheimer's disease and is still married to his wife.

""I don't want to be somebody who's going to cause anybody else who's innocent any kind of pain.""

Kiessling counts her birth mother, with whom she's become close, among those she wishes to protect.

As Kiessling describes it, discovering the man who raped her after all these years has been unsettling for her birth mother.

She'd hoped at the outset of her search to find that the man was dead or in prison. While the latter is deeply unlikely, as for us all, the former is inevitable.

Kiessling awaits that day.

They were the Canadians who made their way onto and across the sand — young men who fought their way ashore to take on the Germans as heavy machine guns fired on them.

""I shall never forget watching our infantry storm those beaches. Theirs is the glory, the power and the glory,"" Halton reported back to Canadians, in an early dispatch on CBC Radio about the dramatic events unfolding in France.

""The navy and the air force made it possible — this landing in France — but on the whole, the honours of D-Day go to the assault troops. I've never seen such zest for the attack.""

CBC war correspondent Matthew Halton describes what he saw and heard on D-Day. 4:31

Some 14,000 Canadians landed at Juno Beach on D-Day, joining the more than 150,000 Allied troops who arrived on five beaches in Normandy that day.

Halton described watching the Canadians disembark from the landing craft before ""scrambling ashore through the bursting shells.""

Allied planes and ships had done what they could to clear the way for these soldiers, but as Halton explained, it was up to the men heading onto the beaches to finish the job.

""Our ferocious supporting fire, as we came in from the sea … and the terrific bombing had stunned or neutralized some of the beach defences,"" Halton said.

""But some of them were untouched, and the assault troops had to jump from their landing craft in the heavy, rising tide and storm the positions with a bayonet, through minefields.""

Halton added: ""These were superb assault troops. Some of them, less than we expected, died on those Normandy sands. But the walls of Fortress Europe were breached.""

A U.S. government funded organization has accused an American reporter who spent 544 days in an Iranian prison for his journalism of being a mouthpiece for the regime.

The Iran Disinformation Project has come under fire for targeting journalists, analysts, and human rights organizations on Twitter who have been critical of U.S. policies such as the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries and sanctions against Iran.

The U.S. State Department on Friday said it has suspended funding for the organization ""until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work."" Many of the tweets have since been deleted.

The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian was among those in @IranDisinfo's crosshairs. He wrote a column about the experience called ""The State Department Has Been Funding Trolls. I'm One of Their Targets.""

Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Jason, first of all, what exactly is the Iran Disinformation Project?

It purports to be a State Department funded initiative that's designed to combat Iranian disinformation campaigns by the Islamic Republic and its proxies, whether by social media or state propaganda. But it's turned into something very different, apparently.

What did they say about you in those tweets?

They've scrubbed many of them, but essentially they claim that I'm a mouthpiece or a lobbyist for the Islamic Republic here in Washington, which on its face is obviously pretty ridiculous.

I spent a year and a half in prison in Iran at the hands of the Islamic Republic. I have an open case against Iran in U.S. federal court for their treatment or mistreatment of me. And I write regularly about the abuses of that regime against the people of that country.

I think that the beef that this particular Twitter account, and those who would intend to amplify it, is that I fall into a camp of people that believe that war with Iran and that massive maximum economic pressure in the form of sanctions against the country's entire economy that have a crippling effect on the people of that country is not the answer.

Another one of their targets is Iranian-American journalist at Washington Post <a href=""https://twitter.com/jrezaian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@jrezaian</a>.<br><br>Ironically Jason and his wife <a href=""https://twitter.com/YeganehSalehi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@YeganehSalehi</a> were arrested and jailed by the IRGC in Iran and fled the country through a prisoner swap. <a href=""https://t.co/u1a5fqLarW"">pic.twitter.com/u1a5fqLarW</a> —@NegarMortazavi

But you and the others seem to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. Is that not also the position of the State Department?

I want to draw a distinction here because I think it's still a bit unclear how much the State Department knew about what this particular grantee was doing with the funding that they received from the U.S. government. I think it still needs to be played out in a more public arena so that we have very clear answers about what the State Department did and did not know about their activities.

But, ultimately, I think the vast majority of people who comment on Iran, especially from outside of Iran's borders, realize that, you know, a 40-year-old theocracy that does not respect equality in terms of gender, religion, race is not something that has a bright future in this world.

So let's just clarify the relationship between the Iran Disinformation Campaign and the State Department. It is funded by the State Department, yes?

It is funded by what's called the Global Engagement Center, something that was started towards the end of the Obama administration designed specifically to combat disinformation campaigns from foreign sources, including most specifically Russia, but also China and Iran.

But what is unclear is what process the people who receive these funds went through and if there's any oversight or co-ordination at all with the State Department on this sort of messaging that they're doing. And my sources in the State Department have said off the record that they were caught a little bit off guard by this whole debacle.

So I think it'll become more clear in the days to come. If the State Department doesn't want to take a transparent line on this, I and others will call for some congressional oversight.

But they are. They have suspended funding to this particular outfit.

They have stated that they have suspended funding temporarily until the account can prove that they will maintain the agreed upon scope of work.

What that means is entirely unclear, and as somebody who's been targeted by this account, I don't think that that's necessarily enough. I mean, defunding, yes. That's the first step. But also, you know, a transparent accounting of who these folks are, why they got the money in the first place and how it's being spent needs to be made in a very public space.

You spent 544 days in jail in Iran. You were in solitary. You were threatened routinely with execution. This is when you had been the Tehran bureau chief for the Washington Post. And finally, after a great deal of negotiating, released. Doesn't that give you some credentials? I mean, to be charged with somehow being a mouthpiece for Iran when you take a moderate position on how Iran should be treated. Shouldn't that account for something?

There's a very small cadre of what we call regime changers, or those who are supporting the most maximalist attacks on the Iranian regime, who see me as as somehow complicit with that regime. I don't think their arguments hold any water and I don't think very many people would agree with them.

But as I've said many times, they have the right to criticize me. They have the right to question my credentials. They have the right to attack my positions. What they don't have the right to do is to label me with slanderous terms that have a detrimental effect on my public reputation if I can prove that those things are false.

What effect is this having on you to be targeted by a project in your own country, State Department funded, after everything you went through in that Evin Prison?

To be honest with you Carol, it's not keeping me up at night. It does upset me. It bothers me. But, ultimately, I've been through a lot worse, and the fact that we can have an open discussion and dialogue about this and that there is accountability and protection in our U.S. Constitution makes me feel a bit more comfortable.

But let's see how it plays out in the days to come. If there aren't consequences, I'll feel a lot worse about it than I do right now.

1505,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"The solutions to veteran homelessness have been clear for years, but an unclear focus has been the Achilles Heel for governments, says one advocate and former Canadian Armed Forces member.

""It's really been a lack of direction,"" Tim Richter, president of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, told The House.

In a rare show of unity on Parliament Hill, members of the Commons Veterans' Affairs Committee across all three major parties called on the federal government to get homeless veterans off the streets.

Estimates are there are over 3,000 former Forces members without a home across Canada.

""I have joked that often ending homelessness is like a high school dance,"" Richter said.

""Everybody is sort of standing on one edge of the wall one side of the hall and no one takes a first step. And I think it's taken someone to make that first step to say you know let's let's put this motion forward let's set a goal of ending veteran homelessness let's make a plan.""

Motion 225 is being brought by the the chair of the veterans' affairs committee, Liberal MP Neil Ellis.

It will be debated for the first time next week in the House of Commons. The two opposition parties support it and believe the motion should be passed before the next election.

The Trudeau Liberals faced calls to produce a concrete plan after their national housing strategy only made passing mention of veterans.

In the strategy, it said ""veteran homelessness is unacceptable,"" and that ""one homeless veteran is one too many,"" but the rest was vague about precisely how they planned to help those individuals.

It's a problem that various governments have lacked direction to solve, and Richter says he feels a personal responsibility to ensure those people are helped.

""When you join the Canadian Forces you become part of a family,"" he said.

""I left now 23 years ago, but you still feel connected to that family … and you still feel an obligation to other members of the family.""","The solutions to veteran homelessness have been clear for years, but an unclear focus has been the Achilles Heel for governments, says one advocate and former Canadian Armed Forces member.

Carmarion D. Anderson says she gets nervous leaving her house after three black transgender women were found murdered in Dallas in less than a year.

The Dallas Police Department has asked the FBI to assist in investigating after 26-year-old Chynal Lindsey's body was pulled from White Rock Lake in Dallas on June 1 with ""obvious signs of homicidal violence.""

Lindsey's death came two weeks after Muhlaysia Booker, 26, was shot to death in Valley Glen Drive, south of White Rock Lake.

Brittany White, 29, was fatally shot in the southeast of the city in October last year.

Anderson, the executive director of the non-profit advocacy organization Blacktrans Women Inc., met Booker in April after she was filmed being beaten by several men in broad daylight.

Here is part of Anderson's conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.

Carmarion, how concerned are you for the safety of black trans women in Dallas after these murders?

Very concerned. We're just all alarmed. I'm more concerned about the visibility — that we're empowered to show up, that we probably can't because we'll be targeted.

We're very concerned about our lives being in danger. It's so alarming right now, especially with these two deaths that just recently just showed up out of nowhere.

What do you know about [Chynal Lindsey]?

I know that she's a transplant here from the Chicago area.

She was a trans woman of colour, which alarms our black trans community here in the [Dallas/Fort Worth] area because it seems that all of the deaths that are happening of the transgender [women] being murdered happen to be black.

Lindsey, 26, moved to Dallas from the Chicago area. (Chynal Lindsey/Facebook )

The Dallas police chief said there's no evidence to suggest that there is a serial killer at work. Do you have reason to believe that trans women in Dallas are being targeted?

I can't say if it's a serial killer, but I can say there is certainly tragedy going on right now with these deaths, who happen to just be black trans women.

Have you changed your habits, have you changed your movements, your exposure to the public?

It's very difficult to do so when I lead an organization, a national organization, that focuses on black trans women, which is called Black Transwomen Inc.

But I do have the anxiety that when I do leave my house, what am I going to come across? And will I be in a position to defend myself if something does come that challenges me?

So, yeah, I think that's on all our minds. You know, yes, I may be a leader — but I'm also a black trans woman that's living in Dallas, and my safety is also No. 1.

Carmarion D. Anderson is the executive director of Black Transwomen Inc. (Submitted by Carmarion D. Anderson )

There's a very disturbing video of Muhlaysia Booker ... before she died, of her being attacked. Can you tell us about that?

It was just any typical day. She was riding with some friends. There happened to be a small fender-bender collision. And, you know, once they identified that she was trans-identified, then came the teasing and the homophobic slurs that escalated into a massive fight.

It certainly was a hate crime if you look at the video.

That's what we experience and it was very challenging to even watch and to still talk about it.

And after that attack, Muhlaysia Booker did not stay silent. She wanted to speak out. Why do you think she found that necessary?

Initially, Muhlaysia did not want to speak out. Muhlaysia was 22 years old. Muhlaysia just wanted to move on with her life, because I'm sure there was some fear and some anxiety.

But then Muhlaysia said something very incredible: ""No, I'm going to do this because this is going to help my community and also future individuals that may be in the same situation.""

So she had the courageousness to open up and actually to speak. I think she also wanted to use that moment to identify that whatever happened, I'm still empowered to show up and still live out my truth.

In this April 20, 2019, photo, Muhlaysia Booker speaks during a rally in Dallas. (Ryan Michalesko/the Dallas Morning News via A)

You got to know her, didn't you, at that rally [in Dallas after the attack] because you were the emcee? What did what did you make of her ... decision to raise her voice?

I was very proud of her. I wanted to let her know that I'm here. That's the reason why I showed up.

I've been doing this for well over 15 years and so I'm very well respected and so [what] I shared with her is that I want her to pull from my energy and I am certainly going to be here to take all of her hurt and her pain and her scares away, because I know that this is something that she wants to do to bring change to our community here in Dallas.

I was there to hug her, look her in her eyes. We cried together. She was a beautiful young lady. And she articulates very well but, you know, again, she just needed that level of support. And I'm just glad that I was actually there at that moment to offer that support to her.

Other women who are friends of Muhlaysia Booker have spoken out, haven't they, about what they think the police are failing to do. There's one woman, Mieko Hicks [who said on Facebook Live] she doesn't think it's a serial killer, but she does think that ... the police are contributing to this because she says, ""They've made it so desperately easy to kill us by not investigating the deaths of black trans women."" Do you think that there's a lack of investigation, lack of concern on the part of police about these deaths?

What I personally know is our Dallas Police Department is doing all that they can to give us answers.

From the outside look in, do I feel they could be doing more? Absolutely, from a community member.

From an institutional level, I feel that they have to cross all their Ts and dot their Is in order to be able to present something that's going to be valid and that will hold up in a court of law.

What can you do to educate and to bring the attention of what's happening to these women to people in Dallas?

For my community, I will always support safety first. You know, question the decisions that we make. If that means that just for us to go walk to the park, let's make a conscious decision and be very aware that we have to be aware of our surroundings.

From our allies ... be our eyes and ears as well. Be the extension to also assist us and protect us. You know, affirm who we are so we can feel comfortable knowing that we have allyship, because they are the ones that have the privilege versus us who are black and ... trans here in Dallas.

Putting those two together, we'll become a greater army and we can perhaps minimize some of the deaths that we're seeing here around Dallas, and allow it to be a blueprint that we can share around the world.

In the final days of Bob Blackwood's life, he knew two things — he wanted a medically assisted death and he wanted to donate his organs.

Thanks to his wife Heather Ross, both of his last wishes were fulfilled. But the process wasn't easy.

Almost 7,000 people have received medical assistance in dying (MAID) since it was legalized in 2016. But according to the Globe and Mail, only 30 of those people have donated organs.

For the first time, there are now national guidelines designed to help doctors navigate the ethical and practical questions that arise from organ donation in MAID. They were compiled by Canadian Blood Services, the Canadian Critical Care Society, the Canadian Society of Transplantation and the Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses.

As It Happens host Carol Off spoke to Ross about why she hopes the guidelines will make the process easier for patients and their families. Here is part of their conversation.

Heather, can you explain to us, first of all, why was it important for your husband to donate his organs?

He had always wanted to donate his organs if he had an unfortunate catastrophic accident. He actually had signed the donor card. I had as well and we also put it in both our wills.

He also has had friends that have had organ donation and knows just how wonderful that gift is.

How much more difficult or complicated was it to donate his organs after he had a medically assisted death?

I wouldn't call it difficult because it felt to him like a wish that he wanted to be able to help someone else live because he had no choice in dying earlier than he would have liked because of the nature of his disease.

And so the fact that he was able to donate his organs almost was a privilege. It actually gave him courage to get to the day when he could donate his organs.

His disease was neurological?

Correct. He originally was diagnosed with Parkinson's and then it took on a much more degenerative form and he was diagnosed with multiple systems atrophy.

And he was in excruciating pain?

Excruciating pain, yes. Intolerable and incurable, untreatable. And it was a difficult journey for him to get access to medically assisted dying because of the criteria for MAID in Quebec.

With the end-of-life criteria, he actually was denied when he first applied for it and then, fortunately, he got a third opinion, and was finally given access.

But by then, his suffering was even worse. He didn't even know whether he could make it to the day when he could have MAID so that he could also donate organs.

Ross holds a photo of her husband. (Kate McKenna/CBC)

I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. People imagine if they were going to have a medically assisted death that it's going to be at home, surrounded only by your loved ones. But in this case, your husband Bob had his death in an operating room. What was that environment like?

It wasn't that bad. It was actually still very supportive and reassuring.

My understanding is some people don't want to donate their organs because they can't do it in that environment. That's, I think, why these new rules are being put forward, so that we can do that in the future.

But I still think until that happens, it's very worthwhile and can be still a very loving, comfortable process. And just the fact that Bob could do this for someone, that took away all his anxiety and fear of the actual final day.

It actually, in some ways, turned a tragic day into a miraculous day that was potentially going to save the lives of other people.

That's wonderful.

Yeah, and that's actually what did happen. The two people that received his kidneys, last I heard, were doing very well.

The doctor who was administering the MAID — because you were in the hospital operating room, it's more impersonal — but how did he make it personal?

By thanking both Bob and I for helping set precedents and a protocol to help people in the future be able to do this.

It was an extraordinary experience for him as well and for everybody in the room.

And for you?

And for me as well. It was so respectful and really honoured Bob's choice and I just can't tell you how moving and amazing it was.

Blackwood's organs were donated after he received a medically assisted death almost two years ago. Ross hopes new guidelines will make the process easier for families considering similar options. (Submitted by Heather Ross)

Do you expect that perhaps part of your husband's legacy will also be that more people will be willing to do what Bob did?

Absolutely. And just being able to share this with you is making one of his wishes before he died come true.

He asked me to try and tell his story so that other people can benefit and maybe have an easier time of accessing MAID as well as organ donation.

I also feel very strongly that people with neurological conditions like Bob's should have easier access to medical assisted dying.

Bob's really made a difference, hasn't he?

He really has. His case brings out a lot of different issues regarding MAID and how it actually happens in real life and how we need to make changes to make it better for everybody.

1508,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"Is the customer always right? The biting nature of some online reviews can make you question that notion.

Joshua Sperber believes that amateur restaurant reviewers don't always have enough insight into why there are issues with the service.

""Maybe something that you chalk up to so-called bad service is really situational. Maybe the server had a horrible morning because their child is sick. So there's a distinct unfairness to these types of reviews,"" he told Spark host Nora Young.

Sperber researched the impact of online review sites on restaurants. For his book, he conducted interviews with wait staff, restaurant managers, and Yelp reviewers.

""We know that servers have been fired for reviews. We know that servers have been suspended for bad reviews. It adds stress, this knowledge that any customer is a potential Yelp reviewer,"" said Sperber.

He argues that while online reviews may seem on the surface to be a great way to empower patrons, those reviewers may unwittingly be putting restaurant workers under a kind of surveillance.

Sperber said that Yelp gives restaurant employees ""a reason to assume they're likely being watched by someone who is not just going to grumble and complain about a supposed bad experience but is actually going to write it up on a website read by millions of people including their manager.""

While he found Yelp reviewers to have a strong ""consumerist mentality,"" he said many were unaware of the direct impact negative reviews can have on restaurant employees.

""It gives [owners] a justification to increase worker productivity and to punish one worker, but more importantly sort of scares the rest of the workers into working harder because they know they could be punished based on a negative Yelp review,"" said Sperber.

Despite the impact of Yelp reviews, Sperber does not see them as a real example of consumer power.

""Structurally speaking, it's the equivalent of playing whack-a-mole. Yelp doesn't equip consumers acting on an individual level, or even collectively, to fundamentally transform business realities. Yelp is not going to do it for us, even if it can punish an individual business.""","The biting nature of some online reviews can make you question that notion.

Indigenous communities will need to see strong action from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau before ""they would even consider voting for this government again,"" according to a reporter with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN).

Kathleen Martens said that many Indigenous voters are upset at Trudeau's delay in using the word genocide to discuss the findings of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls inquiry.

""This report comes down. It has a very strong finding. It uses strong language,"" she told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

""And yet the government, you know, the prime minister doesn't even say the word or accept the report's finding in front of the audience that really needed to hear it.""

PM Justin Trudeau promises to work with Indigenous partners and turn the inquiry’s Calls for Justice into real, meaningful, Indigenous-led action. 1:02

The inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls released its final report Monday, calling the level of violence a "" Canadian genocide .""

Trudeau didn't use the term during his speech at the inquiry's closing ceremony on Monday — but did take the step a day later.

""We accept their findings, including that what happened amounts to genocide,"" he told a crowd in Vancouver Tuesday.

""There are many debates ongoing around words and use of words. Our focus as a country, as leaders, as citizens must be on the steps we take to put an end to this situation.""

A weighted word

J.P. Tasker, senior writer with CBC's parliamentary bureau, says the prime minister may have omitted the term to keep the focus on the 1,200-page report and its 231 ""calls for justice.""

Using the word genocide is ""a profound statement"" that could carry ""international implications,"" he explained.

""We could be hauled in front of the UN.""

1510,CBC Radio,Cbc News,"Researchers have discovered that endangered North Atlantic right whales might have moved into dangerous waters in the Gulf of St. Lawrence because climate shifts disrupted their food source.

North Atlantic right whales have historically summered in and around the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy. Special efforts including regulation of ship traffic and fishing have been made to accommodate the endangered whales, whose total population is just over 400 animals.

2017 a catastrophic year for the whales

In recent years, the whales began to move away from this summer habitat, and in 2017, a larger number of whales appeared in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This led to several ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, plus the deaths of 12 whales that was in addition to the six whales who died in US waters.

On top of that, 2017 and 2018 were terrible reproductive years for the whales, with only 5 calves born in 2017 and none in 2018.

Right whales are at risk of fishing gear entanglement throughout their range, but management authorities can restrict fishing in areas where they are expected to be foraging (Center for Coastal Studies/NOAA permit #932-1905)

Now a team of researchers that included Kimberley Davies from the University of New Brunswick has built a case that might explain why the whales abandoned their traditional feeding grounds.

Davies told Bob McDonald in an interview on Quirks & Quarks that her team found that warmer waters circulating in the Gulf of Maine starting around 2010 seem to have depressed the population of a small, shrimp-like copepod that is an important food source for the whales.

New habitat brought new risks

The whales were then forced to search other waters for a new food source. They found it in the colder waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where a related copepod currently thrives. However this new feeding habitat brought a new set of risks.

Since the whales' unexpected appearance in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2017, new regulations have been put in place to protect the whales in what appears to be their new feeding grounds. Shipping speeds have been limited, and areas where the whales have been predicted to appear have been closed or restricted to fishing.

Davis said she and her colleagues are continuing to work to understand the oceanographic conditions that drive the whales to move into different areas so they can better predict their movements and perhaps avoid a repeat of the disastrous year in 2017.","Researchers have discovered that endangered North Atlantic right whales might have moved into dangerous waters in the Gulf of St. Lawrence because climate shifts disrupted their food source.

Amidst a decades-long system of sexual abuse within the music room from the 1970s to the early 2000s, Ottawa's Bell High School band marched forward.

In the years since, several victims have come forward to share their story. A new CBC Podcast, The Band Played On, hears these stories and delves into the campaign of grooming and assault that took place on school grounds by three teachers: Don Greenham, Bob Clarke, and Tim Stanutz.

All three were charged within weeks of each other in 2016 with crimes including sexual assault, indecent assault and gross indecency.

CBC senior investigative reporter Julie Ireton and The Current's Kristin Nelson seek to answer how the abuse at Bell High School went on for so long and why initial reports were brushed off in the new seven-part podcast.

""It looks at the impact that sexual abuse can have over decades — abuse that took place in locker rooms, on band trips, and in music rooms. Warnings were ignored. Authorities failed to act. The band played on,"" Ireton told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

The Band Played On also explores the pervasiveness of the abuse of power within Canadian schools, and how what happened in Ottawa was not an isolated incident.

""I started to hear from survivors of sexual abuse from across the country ... [from] men and women sharing stories of similar experiences — unwanted sexual encounters with teachers — at their own schools in their own communities from British Columbia to Nova Scotia to the Yukon,"" said Ireton.

Doctors around the world are calling for an end to a flurry of hospital bombings in northwest Syria — in what they say are targeted attacks by Syrian and Russian forces.

Over the past month, 25 medical facilities in Idlib province have been bombed, the doctors say. At least nine of those facilities had shared their co-ordinates with the United Nations, who in turn passed them on to Syria and Russia in an effort to shield the hospitals from attacks.

Dozens of doctors have signed an open letter calling for the bombings to end. Dr. Zaher Sahloul, an exiled Syrian doctor now living in the U.S., is one of them.

Sahloul, who just returned from Idlib province, spoke with As It Happens host Carol Off about what he witnessed. Here is part of that conversation.

We have been watching, since this war began in Syria, watching and seeing hospitals and medical centres that are bombed. But in Idlib we're talking about 25 bombed in just one month. ... Why the high number?

In the Syrian context, this is actually a world record. Hospitals have been targeted in Syria from the beginning of the crisis, mostly by the Syrian regime and the Russians.

Why do you think that it's such a high number in this month?

It looks like it's an orchestrated … effort by the Syrian regime and the Russians to displace people from northern Hama and southern Idlib. This is the last province that is controlled by the opposition.

I would say that this is a very successful military campaign targeting hospitals because the 25 hospitals that were bombed led to displacement of about 250,000 people.

We've ... spoken with doctors as these hospitals have been bombed [who say] that it's just chaos. I mean, you're trying to get people out who are on IVs, you have women who have just given birth, who are in labour, you have children who are sick. ... This is what the hospitals have been dealing with right?

The impression or the perception is that these are hospitals that are treating injured fighters. It is not the case. These are the hospitals in town that are treating children who have fever or who have stomach pain.

It's crimes against humanity, but it's done systematically.

I've seen, in one of the hospitals, an elderly man who had two chest tubes because his village was bombed and he had injury to his chest and he was very depressed. He told me ""What did I do to deserve this?""

When Dr. Muhammad Waseem Maaz was killed in a 2016 airstrike in Aleppo, he was one of the last pediatricians still working inside the war-torn city. ""Who will treat those babies?"" his friend and colleague Dr. Abdul Aziz said in an interview with AIH host Carol Off. (Ben Shannon/CBC Radio) 2:38

This open letter that you and many other doctors have signed, you're demanding the United Nations investigate these most recent hospital attacks in Idlib. What specifically are you asking them to investigate?

They report on this bombing of hospitals as if it is normal and they are supposed to investigate these attacks on hospitals the same way they investigated chemical weapon attacks.

These medical centres and these hospitals shared their co-ordinates, their GPS co-ordinates, with United Nations. ... What did the United Nations do with that information that has made these medical centres so much more vulnerable?

The hospitals were convinced by the [the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs] … to share their co-ordinates with the United Nations Security Council for protection.

This is a process that is called de-conflicting. That means the location of the hospital will become public and that way they are spared from bombing.

Hospitals and NGOs started to share this information, but that did not prevent these hospitals from being targeted with smart bombs.

So clearly the Russians have taken this information, then used them to target hospitals.

How has the United Nations responded so far to this letter that all of you have written?

The typical response, which is condemnations ... There was a recent United Nations Security Council session where [Mark Lowcock], the chief of humanitarian affairs kind of condemned the bombing of hospitals without assigning responsibility.

And he even mentioned that he would not have a response to the hospitals that ask him: ""Should we share our GPS co-ordinates with the UN?""

So that UN chief of humanitarian affairs knows that the UN is guilty. He knows that they do not have a response to that. But in spite of that we're ... not seeing a movement within the UN to have investigation and assign accountability.

1513,CBC Radio,Cbc Radio,"Brendon Meister has tread a long, difficult road after overdosing on drugs three years ago.

The overdose struck at a time when Brendon was using crystal meth heavily, partying hard and sleeping little.

""I'd stay awake for a week at a time,"" Brendon said. ""Seriously.""

Then, after taking what's suspected to have been opioid-laced crystal meth, Brendon's life nearly ended.

The overdose led to a six-week coma. It caused a brain injury that knocked out his motor skills, leaving him unable to walk and impacted his memory, causing him to forget major events of his life.

Kevin Meister, right, dealt with addiction issues himself. He said he's trying to teach his son Brendon, left, everything he learned when it comes to leaving addiction behind. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)

But today, things are improving. Brendon has learned to walk again. He moved into a big household just outside Kentville, N.S., with his dad, his dad's partner, his stepsister and her fiance.

And critically, he found purpose in life again — purpose that comes from a group of goats.

""When I was feeling Coco's belly, petting her, you could clearly feel the bump in it. And it wasn't squishy like it was food. Like … there was a kid in there,"" said Brendon, looking down at a pregnant black and white doe named Coco, one of four goats under his care.

Brendon Meister says farming goats helped him feel a sense of purpose again. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)

The goats are part of an idea he hatched with Jasmine Lomond, his stepsister and caregiver, when they were looking for projects for Brendon — anything that might help him find purpose in life again.

""When he first got here, unless someone went in and woke him, he would stay in bed until suppertime,"" said Jasmine.

While Brendon struggled to find motivation, cognitive issues made things worse. He had trouble remembering the identities of his family members and Lomond would have to remind him who she was, multiple times an hour.

""Meeting someone and not knowing if you already met them before. It can really be frustrating, you know. Like, it troubles your mind,"" said Brendon.

With time, Brendon's motor skills improved, but he still lacked motivation. Eventually, he and Lomond struck on the idea they figured would get him up in the mornings.

They brought the plan to Brendon's dad and Lomond's mom.

""They came to me and Jasmine's mother and said, 'we have an idea. Can we get some goats?'"" said Brendon's dad, Kevin Meister.

Kevin was keenly aware how critical it was for his son to find motivation. A recovering addict himself, Kevin knows what it's like to lack goals.

""You start wondering, 'what's my purpose, what's going on?,'"" he said.

Now, not even two years into the goat project, Kevin said he's seen an ""amazing change"" in his son.

Brendon agreed.

""They help me a lot. They do give me something to talk about with people. Because before, I wasn't working, so I just slept for the most part. But now I'm actually doing stuff with them.""

On top of daily care for the goats, Brendon is in charge of milking them. He is also helping make the soap, bath bombs and scrubs that he and Jasmine sell at several local stores and online.

The business gives Brendon income and a sense of purpose.

The goats give him companionship and lots of laughs.

Liane Lee will never forget the boy she couldn't save.

It was June 4, 1989, and the 26-year-old woman was out in the streets of Beijing with her fellow university students demanding democratic reform, when hundreds of armed soldiers descended on Tiananmen Square to quell the urprising with deadly force.

The soldiers opened fire on the protesters and everything was blood and chaos. Then she spotted him — a young boy, maybe middle school aged.

""He was holding a rock and crying hysterically, 'They killed my brother! They killed my brother! I'm going to fight until I die,'"" Lee, vice-chair of the Toronto Association for Democracy in China, told As It Happens host Carol Off.

Rock in hand, the boy was about to confront the machine-gun toting soldiers and seek his revenge, she said.

""I grabbed him with all my strength and then told him, 'No, you can't go. It's dangerous,'"" she said. ""Then he laid his head on my shoulder and [was] crying like an old man.""

In that moment, an ambulance drove by and the boy wriggled free from her grasp.

""He chased after the ambulance, crying, 'Brother, brother, my brother!'"" she said. ""I thought he just disappeared. But about 30 minutes later, his bloody body was being carried back.""

'Tell the world what happened tonight'

It's not clear how many people were killed that night 30 years ago, when the Chinese government sent troops to crack down on protesters in Tiananmen Square.

No official death toll has ever been released, but witnesses and advocates estimate that thousands of people were killed — gunned down by assault rifles, assassinated by snipers and mowed over by tanks.

And Lee says she could easily have been one of them.

Photos of those who died in the Tiananmen Square massacre are displayed at a 'June 4 Memorial Museum' inside a university in Hong Kong. The exact death toll is unknown. ((Bobby Yip/Reuters))

She was a university student in Hong Kong who travelled to Beijing to join the pro-democracy movement in solidarity.

After she saw the child's body, she says she became so sick that her fellow protesters brought her to one of the makeshift first aid stations set up in the streets. That's when another ambulance pulled up.

""They [were] calling for Hong Kong students to get in the ambulance and then leave. We strongly refused,"" Lee said.

""There is a female doctor. She held my hand, looked into my eyes and talked to me: 'Listen, my child. Please get in the ambulance. You have to leave the square safely. We need you to go back to Hong Kong to tell the world what happened tonight, what our government did to us.'""

'No such thing'

She listened to the doctor, went to the emergency room, and from there, was able to escape Beijing on a flight chartered by the Hong Kong government.

She later moved to Toronto, and then West Virginia. Now she spends most of her time being an ""ordinary"" stay-at-home mom, she said.

But she's never forgotten the reason she survived — so she could tell the world what happened in Tiananmen Square, even if it means reliving her trauma again and again.

""I've been thinking of giving up many times."" she said. ""I just think I have no choice. I have to come out.""

Thirty years later, Liane Lee is still telling the world about what she experienced in Tiananmen Square as a student protester because she feels it's her duty. 3:38

As she watches Chinese and Hong Kong authorities denounce and punish the next generation of young activists, she worries that history will repeat itself.

She especially fears for the young people in China who are unaware of their own history, she said.

She remembers protesting against former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, when several young Chinese people branded her a ""liar"" and insisted there is ""no such thing"" as the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""They yelled at me and they even wanted to punch me,"" Lee said.

The Chinese government has worked vigilantly to scrub the massacre from its history books. It's not taught in school or memorialized in the square. Mentions of it are thoroughly censored from online searches and social media.

Only in Hong Kong — which retains a measure of independence from the Chinese government — is the anniversary marked with a candlelight vigil.

But for Lee's part, she says she will never forget.

""I remember everything,"" she said. ""I force myself to remember their faces, their voices, their crying, their tears, you know, even the last breath of their life.""

Melinda Gates says billionaires have a duty to be philanthropic, and for her that means seeking empowerment for women and girls around the world.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation co-founder has spent years advocating for the safety and equality of women, from pushing for access to contraception in impoverished regions to speaking out against the male-dominated tech and computing industry.

""These are systemic issues. These are societal issues that have existed for a very long time and so there is no silver bullet,"" the former general manager of Microsoft told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

""I've become determined to really look at equality in every type of society.""

Gates writes about this philanthropic philosophy in her book The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World, which she discussed with Tremonti. Here is part of their conversation.

Melinda Ann Gates is an American philanthropist and author. (Pan MacMillan)

You've met a lot of women who have challenged the way you think. And one of them is a woman named Meena. Can you tell us about her?

Meena lived in northern India and I met her and her husband just outside of her home. She'd recently delivered her second baby boy.

She'd had a fabulous birth; it had all gone well. But I was visiting her and at the very end of the discussion I asked her what her hopes and dreams were for this beautiful baby boy that she was holding in her arms, and her [firstborn] son who was standing next to her.

And she broke my heart.

After she looked down for a long time, she said: ""The truth is, I have no hope for these two boys. None. And, in fact, would you take them home with you?""

And all she knew was that I was a Western woman there in a pair of khaki pants and a t-shirt learning about how to help with poverty and make people's lives better.

And that is just a heart-breaking thing, to know that because of poverty, a woman would ask a stranger to take her children home because she knew they would be better off.

The need for contraception is a recurring message that you have received when you meet women as you travel in these countries and look at the ways that your foundation can help them. How much did that surprise you?

It surprised me when it kept coming up over and over and over again, quite honestly.

And then I came back and started to look at the global statistics [of contraceptive access] and that's when I learned that, you know, as a world we're not delivering contraceptives to the over 200 million women that are asking us for them. And to me that is a crisis. And that just shouldn't be.

I believe that we should value life and keep moms and babies alive. And so why would we not allow access to a tool that is a lifesaving tool for women? - Melinda Gates, on global contraceptive access

It is our greatest anti-poverty tool we have on this earth and we know that no low-income country has ever made it to middle income without first allowing voluntary access to contraceptives.

And so to me it was actually abhorrent that we're not actually delivering those tools at scale for women.

I've met women who have walked 12 miles in the heat with two children to get to a clinic where they've learned that contraceptives are available. That's the length they will go to.

Melinda Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundations and constant fixture in Forbes' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women, defends the value of billionaire philanthropy. 1:03

It's interesting because often the narrative coming out of North America, for those opposed to supplying women in developing countries with contraceptives, is that we're brainwashing them. But in fact they were asking you for them.

Absolutely. And so what I know to be true is that we have to educate women about their bodies and then allow them voluntary access to contraceptives.

But what I'm learning is that this is a cry for help. Women are asking us for this tool.

I believe that we should value life and keep moms and babies alive. And so why would we not allow access to a tool that is a lifesaving tool for women?

Women deserve to make decisions themselves about contraceptives and about their children's health and their own health.

1516,,Cbc News,"When Nina Segalowitz was growing up, she dreamed of singing like Bobby McFerrin.

But she never imagined singing on stage with him.

The Grammy Award-winning singer is probably most famous for his a cappella hit ""Don't Worry, Be Happy.""

""I always saw him as this incredible musician because he was able to do all these sounds using only his voice,"" said Segalowitz, who has studied cello since she was three years old, and is also a throat singer.

Segalowitz was in Calgary to prepare for a performance at the Feb. 22 Indspire Awards, which recognize Indigenous achievement. She was offered a ticket to McFerrin's Calgary performance on Tuesday night.

I was either gonna cry, or I was going to sing. - Nina Segalowitz, throat singer

Word got around that she was a throat singer, and that's how McFerrin ended up inviting her on stage at the Jack Singer Concert Hall.

""It was one of those out-of-body experiences. What you have to understand is that growing up, he was one of my idols.""

She said at one point she called on her ancestors for help.

""I was either gonna cry or I was going to sing. Like I had a split second there where I was, 'Okay, you come from a long line of strong women … and you cannot choke at this point.'""

She said she started out slow to help the audience and the musicians get accustomed to her sound.

""As I opened my eyes there was Bobby McFerrin … and then he just started singing with his style.""

Segalowitz said it was an intimate moment, in a huge performance space, but it felt like everyone in the room was with them.

""It blended so seamlessly. It was one of those amazing moments where two singers, two musicians of completely different style, completely different ability, were able to make magic.""

Segalowtiz said she's been honoured to sing for the Queen of Belgium, but this was something else entirely.

""There was more of a connection with Bobby McFerrin, simply because we share an ability to sing and use our throats as an instrument.""

1517,,Cbc News,"Growing up on a northern Manitoban reserve in the 1950s, Dr Marlyn Cook never imagined she would be one of the first Indigenous physicians in Canada.

Now, she's ready to transform the province's health system.

Cook is receiving a national Indspire Award for her 30-year record of service as a family physician on reserve lands. The awards recognize Indigenous professionals who have demonstrated outstanding career achievement.

""It means somebody acknowledged that I do that work of traditional healing with the Western practice, and that meant something to me,"" Cook said of the award.

Trailblazing doctor

The Indigenous Cree woman from Misipawistik Cree Nation became the first First Nations woman to graduate from the University of Manitoba's faculty of medicine in 1987.

As first, she says, she worked as ""a very frustrated nurse"" in Winnipeg in the late 1970s, where she saw first-hand the racism many Indigenous people experience in the healthcare system.

""So I wanted to be an advocate and I wanted to make some changes in the health system, but in the '70s I felt like I had very little voice as a woman, as an Indigenous person and also as a nurse,"" she said.

A doctor she worked with pushed her to go back to school and continue her education.

""She always would ask me questions and tell me to go look it up. And she'd say, 'You know, you're not finished learning yet. You need to continue.'""

Still, she says, she didn't seriously consider going to medical school until 1979, after she gave birth to her son. That's when a friend gave her some information about a new program for Indigenous students.

""It was like a light bulb came on and somebody gave me permission to think about becoming a physician,"" she said.

""And so I did do that. I applied and again, went through difficulties and went through failures but stuck to my guns.""

Her graduation in 1987 was bittersweet. Her mother had passed away a few months prior, after having to be airlifted out of her community due to a medical emergency.

""I was heartbroken, because it was like I graduated too late to help my mother,"" she said.

Blending Western medicine with traditional healing

At the end of her residency, she says, she felt frustrated again. Though she had learned a lot about Western medicine, she felt she didn't have the tools to help First Nations communities.

Though people would come to the city for care, they would return to the same poor social conditions in their communities, and not improve in the long term, she said.

She decided to turn to traditional Indigenous knowledge, blending it with her work as a medical doctor.

""In my 31 years as a physician working in our communities, I have seen those people who are in that pain from the effects of racism, cultural genocide and residential schools be able to get past that pain and let go of alcohol [and] drugs through the use of our ceremonies,"" she said.

""Those ceremonies give you back identity, give you back self-esteem and a sense of pride. And you know when you go into those ceremonies that you've come home, that you're doing what your ancestors did.""

Transforming Manitoba's healthcare

Now, she is working with Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) as part of clinical care transformation team to look at ways to incorporate traditional healing into Manitoba's healthcare system.

She said the Indspire Award gives her the chance to speak publicly about her goals.

""We're spending millions and billions of dollars trying to heal the body without identifying the needs and taking care of the mental well-being and spiritual well-being, which traditional healing does,"" she said.

1518,CBC Radio,Stephanie Cram,"An issue echoed by teachers across the country is the need for more Indigenous teachers in classrooms. A new program launched by the Winnipeg School Division, Indspire and the University of Winnipeg is doing just that, and recruiting students while they're still in high school.

""The Build From Within program is a teacher development program that [Indigenous] students will embark in a six year journey to become educators,"" said Stephanie Midford, a teacher at St. John's High School in Winnipeg where the program launched.

""It's super awesome and very intense, but you know our students are given this opportunity and they're just going to succeed.""

In its first year, the goal for the 30 students who were accepted, is to graduate with both their high school diploma, an an educational assistant diploma.

Once they graduate, they will go to the University of Winnipeg to complete their integrated Bachelor of Arts and Education.

Shane Bostrom, project manager of Build From Within, said the program is unique to the Winnipeg School Division, and was created with the help of local Indigenous elders.

""In talking with elders [they said], we need to find from within our division future Indigenous teachers, instead of trying to find them from everywhere else to come in,"" he explained.

The program was created with the goal of getting more Indigenous teachers into classrooms, which Midford said has the potential to positively impact the education experiences of students.

""The biggest thing is to see that reflection [in teachers], seeing an Indigenous person in front [of the class] who is this role model, mentor, that students can relate to,"" said Midford.

""I think the biggest thing though is [Indigenous teachers] will help decolonize our classrooms … if we have more Indigenous teachers in those roles of leadership, our classrooms will be decolonized.""

Ayla LaForte, a student from St. John's, joined the program and hopes to one day teach kindergarten.

""I personally didn't know how I was going to get into University, just because I didn't know what I wanted to be,"" said LaForte.

""This program [also allows me to] give back to my community, because it has given me so much.""

""The teachers they want us to succeed, it's just important to me personally to give back and be that person for somebody else.""","An issue echoed by teachers across the country is the need for more Indigenous teachers in classrooms.

1519,,Kyle Muzyka Is A Métis Journalist On Secondment For Cbc Unreserved. He'S Worked At Cbc Yellowknife,"James Lavallée, 20, got the call about winning an Indspire Award after finishing kayak practice.

The Métis man from Manitoba who has competed internationally in canoeing and kayaking had heard of the Indspire Awards but didn't think his work was inspiring enough to earn one.

Lavallée is one of 12 recipients of Indspire Awards this year, which honour the education and achievement of First Nations, Métis and Inuit in Canada.

Though he isn't on the Canadian national team currently, he still represents Canada internationally — he most recently raced at the World University Championships in Hungary.

""It's pretty humbling, knowing that the committee and the organization thinks my story is just as inspiring and impactful for the community,"" Lavallée said.

Lavallée, who has dyslexia and ADHD, fell into kayaking because his parents were trying to find some extra-curricular activities to help him with his school struggles.

They tried many sports, including basketball, baseball and Ukrainian dance (and he's not even Ukrainian). Lavallée liked water, but didn't like swimming. The only option remaining, he found, was the kayak.

He stuck with it. Focusing on kayaking also helped him stay focused in school and in a way, it helped him connect with his culture.

""The one thing I was doing is what my ancestors have been doing on the same river for thousands of years,"" Lavallée said.

""That piece really hit me later in life — that I was kind of acting out, in a way, a modern voyageur.""

He wants to start a program that helps Indigenous kids get involved in canoeing and kayaking.

""A lot of cultural aspects and Indigenous aspects have been stripped away from the sport. I'd like to bring a lot of that back — and not necessarily have a competitive club, but to get people to start paddling again and to get people using the river in a traditional way,"" he said.

""Paddling has been such a life-changer for me with school and everything. I want to be able to remove some of those barriers for other people so everyone has access to the sport.""

Traditional medicine

Dr. Marlyn Cook said she was stunned when she found out she was to receive an Indspire Award for her work as a family physician on reserve lands for 30 years.

Cook was on the board 25 years ago for the Indspire Awards, then called the Aboriginal Achievement Awards. Now it's full circle for the physician, who practises in her home community of Misipawistik Cree Nation in Manitoba.

Cook's work focuses on combining Western medicine with traditional Indigenous healing practices. After finishing medical school, she took a seven-day workshop on traditional healing practices and when she went to practise in Cross Lake, she looked to traditional healers for knowledge.

""When I met the old man that I started learning from, he told me, 'We've been waiting for you,'"" she said.

Cook continues to use both types of healing in her practice — with the traditional side new to many of her patients who may have had culture taken away through intergenerational trauma, she said.

""They try to take the Indian out of the child, but when you go back to ceremony, you're putting the Indian back in the being,"" she said.

'It's not about me'

Ronald Derrickson's success in the ranching business was a factor in earning him his Indspire nod, but it wasn't the only one.

His advocacy work for Indigenous communities in legal disputes as a Grand Chief of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs was also important to both him and his community, he said.

""I was surprised, a little bit delighted and wasn't going to come to the awards until my daughter pointed out to me the importance of this award for me to inspire other Natives,"" he said.

Given the opportunity to inspire Indigenous youth across the country, he said he couldn't pass it up.

""It's not about me,"" he said. ""It's about a lot of other people.""

1521,,Cbc News,"Teachers, students and families across Canada will now have access to a map of the country that doesn't include its modern boundaries.

There are no provinces, territories or capital cities on the Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada. Instead, it has information about land claim agreements, treaty areas, traditional lands, Indigenous languages and forced population movements of Canada's Indigenous peoples.

""It's so completely different from anything we've ever seen,"" said Charlene Bearhead, an Indigenous education advocate who worked on the project.

Although it's produced by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, more than 100 Indigenous storytellers, knowledge keepers and writers contributed to creation of the atlas, said Bearhead. She said all decisions for the atlas were made by Indigenous peoples.

The four-volume atlas is not only a map; it's an encyclopedia about the various Indigenous groups of Canada — from First Nations to Inuit.

These are the four volumes included in the atlas. They touch on truth and reconciliation, and include information about the different Indigenous groups in Canada. (Priscilla Hwang/CBC)

""And then there's a giant floor map which is the size of a gymnasium,"" said Bearhead.

The map is accompanied by a guide that's more than a hundred pages, and there are 17 lesson plans that go with it.

""This is so unique. There's not a political boundary on it,"" said Bearhead.

'She started to cry'

""I hope that the youth will feel proud of their people, of where they come from,"" said Karen Wright-Fraser, a Gwich'in contributor to the project. ""We don't have too much of that.""

Now they're going to see themselves. And they're going to feel like we matter. - Karen Wright-Fraser, Gwich'in contributor

She recalled a special moment when an Indigenous educator shared an emotional testimony in a sharing circle.

""She started to cry. And she said the youth that she works with in the school have never seen their name on a map,"" said Wright-Fraser. ""Now they're going to see themselves. And they're going to feel like we matter.""

Wright-Fraser holds the Inuit volume of the atlas. She says she hopes that youth will feel proud of their people after learning from these textbooks. (Priscilla Hwang/CBC)

Wright-Fraser pointed out the blurb that starts each of the volumes.

""'Indigenous perspectives much older than the nation itself,""' said Wright-Fraser, reading from the page. ""I love it.""

The project was produced in partnership with organizations like Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Assembly of First Nations, the Métis National Council, the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and Indspire.

The atlas isn't available in stores until Sept. 20, but people are flocking to pre-order it.

Bearhead said she believes every school district in the country should have at least one of these kits.

Kicknosway is the culture, heritage and spirituality recipient of the 2018 Indspire Awards which recognize the contributions Indigenous peoples are making across Canada. The Indspire Awards aired on CBC television, CBC Radio and CBC online on June 24, 2018.

""This book is based upon a young First Nations woman named Eva Gibson from the Birchbark Indian Reserve. Throughout the book, we get to witness the before and after lives of the Gibson siblings after loss and tragedy. This book touches on how they are rising from substance abuse with help from relatives while rediscovering their healing path and turning to ceremony.

""I can connect with this book because of what my relatives have shared with me and how I've had to deal with my own loss. One sentence in the book said, 'You had a chance to redefine that legacy.' I believe what they're trying to say to us is that if we get the chance to redefine a legacy, we should seize it. After reading this book, I am grateful that Waubgeshig shares his talents of creating through his storytelling. I look up to him and acknowledge his perseverance and determination for writing such a powerful book.""

1523,This entrepreneur is paving the way for other Indigenous women in Alberta’s energy industry,Abigail Murta,"(Photo courtesy of Nicole Bourque-Bouchier)

No two days are the same for Nicole Bourque-Bouchier.

Before our 11 a.m. interview, the co-owner and CEO of The Bouchier Group, one of Alberta’s largest Indigenous-owned oilsands contracting companies, had pushed through a full morning and was heading for a packed afternoon.

“I got my kids ready for school, I actually already had a meeting this morning, too,” said Bourque-Bouchier. “And right after this, I have to go on site to one of our oilsands and then head over to a community meeting at Fort McKay.”

Bourque-Bouchier is listed as one of Scotiabank’s 2015 Canada’s Top 100 Most Powerful Women, but she is also an active advocate for Indigenous women's economic empowerment. This year, the Mikisew Cree First Nation member received the 2018 Indspire Award for business and commerce.

“It really is validating,” said Bourque-Bouchier. “I feel like I’m paving a path for Indigenous women.”

Finding strength in tragedy

Born in the Northwest Territories, Bourque-Bouchier was raised in Fort McMurray, Alta., the eldest of four girls.

Growing up surrounded by the small community of First Nations and Métis people of Fort Chipewyan kept her rooted in her Indigenous identity. Among her many mentors was her father, who passed down the rich culture of the Mikisew Cree First Nation to her and her three younger sisters.

After the unexpected deaths of her siblings, she found the resilience to push forward, motivated to create a better future for her community.

“I was the last surviving, and instead of wallowing, I decided to keep going and do something better for myself,” said Bourque-Bouchier.

She decided that entrepreneurship held the key. Her time in Fort McMurray — the heart of Canada’s oilsands — inspired her to pave a foundation for women in the construction industry.

Along with her husband, she founded The Bouchier Group. The company has a construction arm, which does everything from building roads to steel fabrication, and a site services arm, which specializes in camp maintenance and logistics. As the Athabasca oilsands grew, The Bouchier Group did, too, ultimately growing from 35 to 1,000 employees.

""I was the only female in the room and I’d be addressed as my husband’s assistant.""

Bourque-Bouchier pointed out that this success didn’t happen overnight. It took her 14 years of patience and dedication to earn the respect of her industry, learning hands-on, working from the ground up. A novice in the field, she was also navigating the obstacles as an Indigenous woman in a predominantly white, male-dominated construction industry.

“In the early days, I was the silent person in the room,” she said. “People wouldn’t look at me. I was the only female in the room and I’d be addressed as my husband’s assistant.”

Bourque-Bouchier has made serious strides in breaking down gender barriers in the oilsands. But more importantly, she’s been instrumental in making The Bouchier Group a massive success. Under her leadership, the company has become one of Fort McMurray’s largest local contractors, while also maintaining a strong sense of social responsibility.

She is also helping build the next generation of Indigenous women entrepreneurs. Bourque-Bouchier has helped raise more that $3 million to fund local initiatives to empower Indigenous women in the workforce.

“I think that we have a sense of community and a priority to give back to these communities no matter how small or big we are,” said Bourque-Bouchier.

Abigail Murta is a Toronto-based journalist who writes human interest stories focusing on social change, arts and culture. She is a graduate from Ryerson University's School of Journalism, and you'll likely find her out and about listening to a podcast or scouring the city for the next best second-hand treasure.","Along with her husband, she founded The Bouchier Group.

Dennis is the 2018 co-host of the Indspire Awards, an event honouring Indigenous success and achievement in business, arts, sports, public service and more. The Indspire Awards aired on CBC television, CBC Radio and CBC online on June 24, 2018.

""This novel epitomizes the new voice of Indigenous writers that are using their platform to shed light on the past injustices of Indigenous peoples, not to dwell on our victimization, but to ask the question: 'How do we take control of our own destinies?'

""Tommy Orange provides a sympathetic voice to his assortment of marginalized Indigenous characters, while still providing critical examinations of the hypocrisies that exist in our communities, particularly in the self-imposed 'Native leaders' that take it upon themselves to speak on behalf of the entire Native experience.

""His writing is angry, graphic and poetic, delving into the imagery of Native spirituality without ever romanticizing it or falling into the stereotypical Native mystic trap. Most importantly, despite the violence and hardships depicted in the book, there is an overall sense of love and hope for the Indigenous experience; the book is filled with Indigenous characters that are nuanced, complex and extremely human. It is a depiction often lacking in Indigenous stories, programs and social media accounts, that have derived their success from the depiction of our people as pan-Indian, helpless victims and lacking free will.""

Darrell Dennis is a First Nations comedian, actor and screenwriter. He is from the Secwepemc Nation in the interior of British Columbia. He first starred in the CBC drama Northwood at age 17. Since then, Darrell's worked in classic theatre roles to film and television roles.

Canada does not have a women's entry, but the men open against Mongolia on Saturday at 4:40 a.m. ET, followed quickly by a game against Russia at 6:10 a.m. ET. The Canadians finish off pool play on Monday against the Philippines (4:50 a.m. ET) and Brazil (6:30 a.m. ET).

This is the fifth time the 3-on-3 World Cup is being held, with Serbia having won three of the previous four men's events.

Canada, ranked 14th in the world, will face two of the top six teams in the world in Russia (No. 3) and Brazil (No. 6). Only the top two teams in each of the four pools advance to the quarter-final knockout round.

""Being in this group is no surprise to us,"" Linklater said. ""We're used to being put in groups like this because of our ranking, but we're confident and coming home with a medal is the plan.""

'Childhood dream'

Linklater is considered one of the most savvy and skilled players in the 3-on-3 game and was voted the most spectacular player in the world league just a year ago.

Linklater is Nehiyaw, from Thunderchild First Nation in Saskatchewan (He'll be one of the award recipients at this year's Indspire Awards, which honour outstanding individuals in Indigenous communities and will be broadcast on June 24 at 8 p.m. ET on CBC, CBC Radio One and cbc.ca/watch.

He grew up in the inner city of Saskatoon and fell in love with basketball at the age of 11. The sport came naturally to him. Linklater spent a lot of time in those early days perfecting his dribble, drive and shot on streets and local outdoor courts.

He played high school basketball in the city, won a national university championship with the University of Saskatchewan Huskies and then went on to play professionally in the International Basketball League.

Now he finds himself back where it all began, playing street hoops, and he's having the time of his life as he prepares to represent his country at the World Cup.

""This is a childhood dream for me,"" Linklater said. ""It means a lot to all of us to represent our country. We earned the right to be here based on our past five years of play. And we're putting Saskatoon and Canada on the map in 3-on-3 basketball.""

'No place to hide'

It's only been a year since the International Olympic Committee announced 3-on-3 basketball would join the Olympic program in 2020 as part of the IOC's efforts to give the Games a more youthful and urban appeal.

The 3-on-3 game is pretty simple. It's typically played outdoors on a half court with one basket. Teams are allowed one sub on the bench. The shot clock starts at 12 seconds (half as much time as NBA players get). Shots made from inside the arc, as well as free throws, are worth one point. Shots made from beyond the arc are worth two. When the defensive team gains possession of the ball, they have to take it out beyond the arc. Games last 10 minutes, or until a team reaches 21 points.

""There's no place to hide in the 3-on-3 game,"" Linklater said. ""You have to be in better shape and have to excel in all aspects of the game.""

Only eight teams will qualify for each of the men's and women's tournaments at the Olympics, putting a lot of pressure on Canada to improve its ranking and earn a spot.

Linklater could have never imagined the opportunity that now presents itself, but is making it very clear he wants to be in Tokyo competing for Canada.

""I couldn't believe that I was there with everyone who is very important,"" said Theland Kicknosway, the 12-year-old traditional drummer and singer who led the procession into the ceremony with a drum song.

Justin Trudeau unveiled his new cabinet on Nov. 4, making history and breaking new ground. 50 per cent of the ministers are women, and for the first time ever, an indigenous woman is at the helm of justice.

The new prime minister made another significant addition to the day. He included indigenous culture in the ceremony.

""It was a surreal moment. I could not believe that I was right there,"" recalled Kicknosway, who is Pottawatami and Cree from Walpole Island, Ontario.

The traditional dancer, singer and drummer said at first he was nervous but soon got that out of the way and the song came naturally.

The significance of being a young drummer was not lost on him.

""I think it's important because if we have aboriginal youth and young leaders, like myself, we can bring them into a place that's humble with good spirituality.""

Theland Kicknosway, 12, leads the procession before swearing-in at Rideau Hall 2:52

Drumming to raise awareness

It wasn't the first time Kicknosway has been to Parliament Hill to play for politicians and dignitaries.

Kicknosway played his hand drum for survivors, commissioners and guests at the closing ceremonies of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission this past June.

In 2013, he walked 134 kilometres from Ottawa to Kitigan Zibi, Quebec, to raise awareness about the children of missing and murdered indigenous women who are left behind, an issue near to his heart.

Kicksnoway wore his Maisy and Shannon T-shirt under his ribbon shirt for the swearing-in ceremony, gifted to him during his trek. Maisy Odjick and Shannon Alexander were 15 when they vanished from Alexander's father's home in Kitigan Zibi in 2008. They have never been found.

""If I'm thinking of the murdered and missing indigenous women and all of the First Nations, Métis and Inuit women, and bring them into the Governor General's [residence] then they will be remembered. We got to keep talking about it.""

In the first 100 days of being in government, Trudeau has promised to hold an inquiry into the more than 1,200 indigenous women who have gone missing or have been murdered in our country since 1980.

As for any other expectations from the government, Kicknosway is not quite ready to dive into specifics.

""I don't know, like, I don't know what to expect. If they support our aboriginal/indigenous people I think that is enough but I don't think I'm really focused on that. I'm focused on school, I'm only 12.""","50 per cent of the ministers are women, and for the first time ever, an indigenous woman is at the helm of justice.

He was a Grade 10 student in a ""normal"" high school in Kelowna, B.C., who had been crowned the top academic student in his class.

""I'm much better at academics than ballet,"" Fraser-Monroe admits while sitting in a boardroom in the Royal Winnipeg Ballet building, having finished a class just minutes before — the first of many that day.

Cameron Fraser-Monroe, left, says he wants to be ""well-established"" with a dance company in five years. (Royal Winnipeg Ballet)

Originally, Fraser-Monroe had come to Winnipeg to see his father, a member of the Tla'amin First Nation in Powell River, B.C., receive an Indspire Award, which celebrates Indigenous successes and achievements. His dance teacher encouraged him to audition for the school during his trip. Before that summer, he says the idea of being a professional ballet dancer hadn't been ""realistic.""

'I was not talented enough to blow off my academics'

Now on his last of three years at the RWB school, he's getting ready to launch a career as a professional ballet dancer. However Fraser-Monroe is dubious of how easy that will be, which is why the dancer has always kept the academic door open.

""Our whole careers can be based on a little bone in your ankle snapping, and that's it,"" he explains.

While at the ballet school, the students take academic classes at the University of Winnipeg Collegiate, which allows more flexibility than a regular high school. Some dancers at the RWB may be inclined to neglect their classes, says Fraser-Monroe, but he doubled his course load at the collegiate.

""I was not talented enough to blow off my academics,"" he insists.

That's slightly hard to believe, since that fateful summer he auditioned for the RWB the teen was offered a scholarship on the spot. At that point he had only been dancing ballet a couple of hours a week.

'We're not being handed anything'

Although he says he wants to be ""well-established"" with a dance company in five years, he is refusing to close the door on a life outside of ballet. He has applied to the University of Waterloo and the University of British Columbia for mechanical engineering, and it's not surprising to find out the overachiever has been offered a scholarship to both schools, which he has deferred.

""I do know if I injure myself, or lose passion, I have that door open to me,"" he said, adding, ""We're not being handed anything. Graduating from the school doesn't mean we'll have a job when we get out.""

Cameron Fraser-Monroe was the top academic student in his Grade 10 class before joining the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. (Amie Roussel)

If he succeeds at a life in dance, Fraser-Monroe says he may still end up going to school later in life. The Tla'amin First Nations offers 30 post secondary scholarships to its members.

""Which means [because] I have that available to me, I don't have to save a ton of money dancing,"" he says, adding that most ballet dancers don't make very much money to begin with.

As well as finishing up his final year at RWB and receiving two university scholarships, Fraser-Monroe is also student council president and he has a part time job as a kitchen assistant.

When asked about the lessons he's learned in the past three years, and what he would tell his younger self, he says, ""make your level of achievement a habit.""

""Make it a habit that you are always disciplined, so you are always good at what you do so you're not turning it on and off for what you're passionate about,"" he says. ""And stretch more.""","He was a Grade 10 student in a ""normal"" high school in Kelowna, B.C., who had been crowned the top academic student in his class.

1532,,Cbc News,"How Canada's future lies in education and reconciliation — that is the topic of the University of Waterloo's 60th Convocation Lecture, which will be given by Roberta Jamieson Monday evening.

Jamieson was the first Indigenous woman to earn a law degree in Canada, is a member of Six Nations of the Grand River and a fierce advocate for Indigenous education.

Her lecture dives into how the original dream for Canada, developed by the early settlers and Indigenous people, was distorted.

She said the original dream started when Indigenous communities welcomed and shared their knowledge and resources with early settlers.

However, she said, things went wrong early on.

""There were many things done to disempower, legislate out of existence, the Indigenous peoples and I think, it's pretty clear, that things went terribly wrong from the original relationship,""Jamieson told CBC's Craig Norris, host of The Morning Edition​, on Monday.

She added many Canadians may not know that movements like the first Indian Act were put in place for the gradual civilization of Indigenous peoples, that they needed a permit to leave the reserve and those who earned a university degree would lose their status.

""I think a lot of Canadians don't know these things,"" she said.

Education is key

Jamieson, who is also CEO of Indspire, a national Indigenous-led charity, said she believes education plays a major role in achieving reconciliation.

She said that includes educating people about Canadian and Indigenous history. As well, Indigenous people should be encouraged to learn about their communities using their language and values.

""Reconciliation is not a noun, reconciliation is a verb,"" she said.

She said she hopes the government's initiative for reconciliation is not a phase. Jamieson said so far, she feels ""encouraged and optimistic"" based on some actions taken by provincial and federal governments, such as granting bursaries to students and a commitment to preserve and protect Indigenous languages.

""I think there is a role for Canadians, too. It's not just the government,"" she said. ""It's all of us working together. That's how we are going to shape this country.""",,"['reconciliation', 'things', 'original', 'wrong', 'went', 'indigenous', 'think', 'university', 'canadians', 'early']",,https://www.cbc.ca/indspire

""I've always had something in me, just a little bit of a fiery passion,"" said the 25-year-old Mi'kmaq youth from Nova Scotia.

""Injustices or something that didn't quite sit right with me, I would find a way to do something about it or I'd say something about it.""

Created in 1993, Indspire honours Indigenous professionals and youth who demonstrate outstanding career achievement. Thirteen Indigenous people were celebrated at a gala event this past Friday in Ottawa.

Dymond was among them, one of three youth award recipients. He is a first year medical student at Queen's University School of Medicine in Kingston, Ont. He earned both his undergraduate and Master of Science in Kinesiology at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

But it is his volunteer and advocacy work that really makes Dymond shine.

As well as being part of search and rescue with the Canadian Coast Guard Inshore Rescue Boat Program, Dymond is one of the founding members of the Wape'k Mui'n drum group; was a youth representative at the St. John's Native Friendship Centre; and the Aboriginal students' representative with the Memorial University Student Union.

His advocacy also extends to Sisters in Spirit, which aims to raise awareness surrounding violence toward Indigenous women and girls, and Education is a Right which promotes, in part, an increase in post-secondary funding for Indigenous students.

All this while maintaining a full academic course load and a part-time job.

He said he gets his fiery passion from his parents who instilled in him a good work ethic. Dymond said that while he did not grow up knowing much about his culture, when he did connect, it sparked another passion.

""In grade 8 I gave a speech about the Mi'kmaq language,"" he said. ""I know this is a part of me; I know bits and pieces; and I knew I had family who were Aboriginal.""

Dymond said he did some research and delivered a public speech asking 'why am I not learning my language?' He said with the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 calls to action, some of with focus on the loss of language during the Residential School era, the answers are becoming clear.

""I can't blame myself; I can't blame my grandfather for not knowing his language.""

It was in university where Thomas learned more about his culture and himself. That is where he became more engaged in student and Indigenous advocacy and where he came out as gay.

""It was a difficult time because I thought I had it all figured out. I could just be myself and this is what it was,"" he recalled.

He struggled with his sexuality, even spiraling into binge drinking and a negative relationship.

""There was always, I guess, some attraction for men but it wasn't something that I was like, I'm attracted to a person, it was just the physique or whatever so I thought maybe I'm just curious.""

Dymond eventually made peace with his sexuality, even coming out to his parents who were very welcoming and supportive.

""[Dad] said 'Thomas we're not stupid, we're just very nice people and we'll love you no matter what,'"" he said.

""They have been my sound board for when I call home and I'm upset, I'm crying, I don't know what to do, that I can just say I've got somebody who loves me and you know what, I'm very fortunate to have that because not everybody does.""","He's studying to become a doctor but it is Thomas Dymond's passion for advocacy that has been recognized with an Indspire Award.

1535,,Cbc News,"Elder Mae Louise Campbell is one of two recipients receiving a 2016 Indspire award for culture, heritage and spirituality, presented tonight in Vancouver.

The road to discovering her identity and spirituality wasn't easy, Campbell said.

""I didn't know who I was for many, many years and I had to go in search of my own identity as an aboriginal woman with great difficulty in those years,"" said Campbell.

Campbell is an elder-in-residence at Red River College in Winnipeg, as well as the keeper of Winnipeg's Grandmother Moon Lodge, which provides spiritual healing services to women in need.

""I'm a great believer in believing that until our women are healed, nothing will happen in our communities, no changes will be made,"" said Campbell.

""The men have to support that teaching and I know many of the men are saying now, 'The grandmothers need to teach us how to be warriors again.'""

Other Indspire Awards recipients include Carey Price for sports and Joseph Boyden for arts.

The award gala takes place in Vancouver at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre Friday night.",,"['know', 'award', 'identity', 'campbell', 'recipients', 'women', 'men', 'great', 'spirituality', 'indspire']",,https://www.cbc.ca/indspire
