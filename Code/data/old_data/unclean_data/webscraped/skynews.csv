0,World Oceans Day: UK joins fight against plastic pollution with nationwide events,Lucia Binding,"The UK is joining the global fight against plastic pollution by marking World Oceans Day in a bid to raise awareness about protecting and conserving the seas.

Events are held on 8 June in an annual observation to honour the world's oceans, which provide the earth with many resources including oxygen, climate regulation, food sources, medicine and more.

However the oceans and marine life, such as corals and important fisheries are under threat due to a number of challenges they face including plastic pollution and overfishing.

In London, the day is being marked in a variety of ways, with a full day of performances, workshops and talks focusing on the importance of saving the world's oceans at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.

There will be a pop-up exhibition in Soho, central London, by the Project O initiative as part of Soho Music Month, as well as an opportunity to dress up in blue at a Greenpeace ""human wave"" from Westminster Bridge to the Foreign Office.

Elsewhere, one of Scotland's most popular visitor attractions, Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling, is hosting a weekend of ocean-themed activities involving an opportunity to take part in a large-scale art project.

In Cardiff, Greenpeace are inviting the public to dress up as penguins on Queen Street in a campaign to help protect the oceans and Antarctica.

The United Nation's World Oceans Day designated theme this year is ""Gender and Oceans"", to highlight the significance of gender equality in the effectiveness of conserving the planet's oceans, seas and marine life.

The day is being used to publicise the progress of gender equality in ocean-related areas including marine scientific research and policy-making.

There has been a concerted effort to promote World Oceans Day since 2002 and is viewed as a special opportunity to celebrate the ocean and make a real difference in protecting it.

In 2009, on the first United Nations International Day for World Oceans Day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations said the day was an opportunity to ""recognise the considerable challenges we face in maintaining their capacity to regulate the global climate, supply essential ecosystem services and provide sustainable livelihoods and safe recreation"".

Ban Ki-moon went on to say that human activities are ""taking a terrible toll on the oceans and seas"" including unreported and unregulated fishing and increasing sea temperatures from climate change.

Last month, it was reported that climate change could be the reason why thousands of tufted puffins have starved to death in the Bering Sea.

Earlier this year, diver Rich Horner, who lives in Bali, sparked an international conversation about plastics in the ocean, after a video taken during a swim went viral.

He said the effect of plastics on marine life is ""horrific"", telling Sky News: ""The mixture of the stuff you see is just crazy. General household stuff is there, baskets and buckets, but always you get a lot of plastic bags and food wrappers, but not as many water bottles as you would think. They get picked up in Indonesia, because they get recycled.""

2,'60 years to save Venice': Crumbling city at 'point of no return',Mark Stone,"It's 6am in St Mark's Square, a time when this place is at its majestic best.

This is Canaletto's Venice. Beyond the palaces, the rising sun glistens on the water of St Mark's Basin.

And then the spell is broken. A massive cruise liner cuts across my view.

It's a week since the MSC Opera crashed into the jetty a few hundred metres from the square. It was an incident which locals here had predicted would happen.

Almost universally, the people of Venice have complained about the presence of cruise ships so close to their lagoon city.

""We knew it would happen,"" local Jane Da Mosto tells me. ""It's a massive smack in the face.""

Quite apart from the physical risks of having such huge vessels so close to a thousand-year-old crowded city, locals say their presence is damaging to the environment and brings the wrong type of tourism.

Jane is the founder of the charity We Are Here Venice, which campaigns to protect the city.

""Without considering the social and economic impact of bringing so many people into the city at the same time, all keen to spend as little money as possible, because the business model of the cruise ship encourages people to do all their spending on board,"" Jane tells me.

""If one considers the environmental and physical impacts of these ships, the first things to say is that their atmospheric emissions are incredibly damaging to air quality in Venice.""

Image: Jane Da Mosto says cruise ships are incredibly damaging to air quality in Venice

The cruise industry disputes this.

Francesco Galietti, Italy's director of the Cruise Lines International Association, says worse pollution is caused by smaller boats in the narrow canals. He dismisses the suggestions that the ships bring the wrong type of tourism.

""I believe this is a misleading representation of our tourism,"" he says.

""The economic impact in Venice is huge and our tourism is sustainable. Our tourism is not grab and run. Venice is a home port - that is the journey starts or ends in Venice - and most passengers spend at least a night in Venice at the beginning or at the end of their journey.

This isn't a new argument. The debate over whether to allow these ships here has yoyoed for years.

Image: Venetians say waves caused by heavy traffic on canals are damaging the city's buildings

In 2014, the Port of Venice proposed a ban and suggested dredging a new canal to re-route the ships. The regional government then overturned that decision.

Then Italy's central government overturned that ruling, announcing that by 2015 all cruise ships would be banned.

But work on an alternative route - which itself raised significant environmental questions - never started. And so the argument went on, and the ships are still here.

The issue puts a focus on a much broader challenge: the survival of Venice.

This is a story of chronic mismanagement and a crumbling city of failed engineering projects and huge environmental challenges.

It's more than that though. Encapsulated on one lagoon city are so many of the challenges we are all facing.

Image: Vittorio Da Mosto (left) says the incessant waterborne traffic is damaging the city's buildings

Jane Da Mosto's son Vittorio is 22. He's a student and increasingly active in trying to help preserve his city.

He's taking us on the alternative canal tour. We pass stunning old buildings, crumbling at their base.

""This is a big problem of Venice - the traffic and the waves that they all make. Taxis aren't controlled as much and they make damage,"" Vittorio tells me.

Some experts reckon there we only have a few decades to save Venice.

""Sixty years is what they say,"" Vittorio confirms.

""We have already gone to the no return point when we are 60 years until real drastic problems will start to, shall we say, invade Venice.""

We head out into the lagoon on which Venice sits to an engineering project that's become a tragic joke for locals.

The Mose is a massive flood barrier. Or at least it should be.

Image: Construction of the Mose flood barrier has been marred with allegations of corruption

""What it's supposed to do is to come up when you have an extreme high tide. That's usually over 1.30 metres,"" Vittorio says.

""What it's supposed to do is decrease the water coming into Venice to decrease the high tide. It was supposed to be finished in 2011 but right now its been postponed until 2022.""

Throughout, the Mose project has been plagued with allegations of corruption and mis-management, and environmentalists claim its design is flawed anyway.

We move from the Mose to the natural beauty of the lagoon.

""Here on the right you can see the salt marshes that are a vital part of the ecosystem of the lagoon and slowly with the dredging of the canals, the rising of the water level, these are slowly getting lost,"" Vittorio says.

""As you lose the marshes you lose the ecosystem,"" he says.

""In a strange way, the more people that come to Venice, the harder it is for the ecosystem to survive,"" he adds.

Image: Salt marshes are slowly being lost due to rising water levels

We drive back past a sand bank, which Vittorio and his friends cleared of plastic a few weeks ago, and another that needs to be done.

Very high tides are more and more frequent here now. The city floods far more than it used to and the erosion is devastating. It is especially bad because of the salt in the water.

Jane Da Mosto is from London originally but a Venetian for 25 years and an environment scientist who now depressingly finds her subject all around her.

""I do think that Venice could be an important example to other places around the world,"" she tells me.

""Venice is a unique city but the single critical issues that are challenging Venice are very common to other places, but its true we have benefit here in Venice of seeing things close up and magnified and also having an impact on the scale of this city because its relatively small and tightly packed.""

""I do think Venice is kind of the canary in the mine because it has so much international attention on what happens to Venice everybody thinks of Venice, most people love Venice so we really are at the coal face of showing that the future is possible.""

Back in St Mark's Square the crowds have gathered. On a daily basis now there are double the number of tourists as they are residents. Regularly, 100,000 visit on a single day.

On the corner of the square is Gelateria Al Todaro. It was opened in 1948 by Giovanni Barbalich and brought ice cream to to the city for the first time.

It's run now by Giovanni's great grandson Claudio Vernier.

Image: Claudio Vernier wants to protect Venice from overcrowding and pollution

""I am here because I want to do something for this city. I try and I think that a lot of persons - not only Venetians but everyone in the world who love Venice - want to do it. In my opinion we have to think about the city against the pollution, against the over-tourism so we have do decide how many person every day,"" Claudio says.

He is also the president of the St Mark's Square Traders Association and spends much time these days worrying about flooding.

""There are a lot of studies and yes it's always more frequent. Yes it is,"" he says.

""But now we have not only the problem of the high tide but it's also the waves because a lot of water enter from the sea and its really strong and the pressure on the buildings that is terrible.

""It's not like a lake, its like a river so really really strong water against the buildings, the palaces.""

Back on the canal with Vittorio, I ask how much he worries about his city.

""Quite a bit, yes. Recently more than I used to. It's because I have become more active and I get to see all of the problems with a sense of being here.""

What's encouraging is that he and his young friends are increasingly active in trying to help campaign for the protection and preservation of the city. He and his friends run a grass roots association called Venice Calls.

Image: Venetian protesters are calling for an end to large ships travelling through the city

But up against that is the realisation that fewer and fewer people actually live in the city. The population is in decline.

Vittorio says: ""I definitely think it's important to invest in the young community of Venice and to help them find a place to live in Venice to keep them within the community so that they can help prevent these problems.

""If the motive is instead to fill it up with tourism and get more and more people from outside coming to live here that will lead to Venetians leaving the city and it becomes Disneyland.""

His mother Jane agrees.

""If you save Venice as a living city with its resident population who know how to care for it, Venice is a better place to visit and also Venice is a microcosm of how to save a place that is relevant to the future of the world,"" she says.

Jane lives in a sinking city surrounded by a rising sea and unsustainable unregulated growth in tourists but she is not despondent.

""All the problems of Venice can be broken down into the component parts and analysed objectively and solutions can be found,"" she adds.

""We are not trying to inhabit Mars; we are trying to fix things in a city that's been here for 1,000 years and I don't want to be part of the population that lets it all just slip away.""","Pic: Venice Fire ServiceAlmost universally, the people of Venice have complained about the presence of cruise ships so close to their lagoon city.

Decade of corruption leaves former South African City of Saints in the dumps

Few places in Africa are blessed like Grahamstown, a community of 70,000, nestled amid the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape in South Africa.

It boasts a fine university called Rhodes and several prestigious private schools. The country's largest arts festival takes over the community's auditoria and public spaces during June and July and the locale's 40-odd churches have earned it the nickname City of Saints.

However, there is nothing holy about Grahamstown's current situation. After a decade of corruption and blinding incompetence at the hands of local, provincial and national politicians, this saintly city is in the veritable dumps.

The charge sheet is lengthy. For one, the near-total neglect of the municipal water system has created a health and sanitation crisis. Untreated sewage runs freely in parts of town and the supply of drinking water has nearly collapsed.

Image: The people of Makhana have even carried out their own road works

""This is a man-made disaster created by members of a municipal council who have no idea or experience of how to manage it,"" says businessman and activist Ron Weissenberg.

The local government cannot pay its electricity bills and the national utility ESKOM has threatened to cut the city off. Nor can it afford to administer to the potholes or the piles of rubbish which dot the community. Locals told us that patients in Grahamstown's hospital routinely sleep on the floor.

The flailing municipality did get a name change however - last year, the Minister for Arts and Culture changed Grahamstown to Makhanda - the name of a Xhosa warrior who fought against land dispossession at the hands of British settlers.

Image: The city had worked hard for its glowing reputation

It took two centuries for Grahamstown - or Makhanda - to establish itself as an orderly and picturesque locale. Yet it has fallen fast and it shares this decline with dozens of other communities across the country.

In 2018, the government admitted that only 7% of the country's 257 municipalities could be considered ""well-functioning"". At least 87, including Grahamstown, were classed as ""distressed or dysfunctional.""

The co-operative governance minister, Zweli Mkhize, blamed ""political instability, interference, corruption and incompetence"".

This extraordinary failure to govern - to provide for basic needs and services - is the responsibility of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). It may have liberated the nation when former leader Nelson Mandela swept the apartheid regime aside, but as a party of sound administration it has failed.

A couple of weeks ago, South Africans gave the ANC's new leader, 66-year-old Cyril Ramaphosa, a chance to clean up the mess when he won a reduced majority of 57% in the national election. Without the respected activist-turned businessman in charge, analysts think the ANC would have been lucky to scrape 40%.

Mr Ramaphosa has promised to fight for a country where ""public servants faithfully serve no other cause than that of the public"", yet he is now struggling to balance this commitment with the need to reward party allies who backed his leadership bid.

ANC realpolitik has already intervened. Powerful party figures like former provincial premier David Mabuza expect payback for their support and Mr Ramaphosa has just appointed him deputy president - despite the fact that Mr Mabuza has been implicated in a litany of crimes, including conspiracy to murder, money laundering and fraud.

The rot has spread so extensively in South Africa that few think Mr Ramaphosa can fix it on his own - something the residents of Grahamstown know instinctively.

""You can't leave politics to the politicians,"" says Philip Machanick, a computer science professor at Rhodes who also heads the residents' association.

""We have to be involved. We have to help them do their job.""

Image: Residents have taken matters into their own hands. Pic: Grahamstown Residents Association

This rallying cry for a form of total-community politics has been embraced by a diverse group of people in Grahamstown.

City estate agents joined forces with members of the Unemployed Peoples' Movement and created a petition calling for the removal of the local council. Within weeks 22,000 people had signed up.

In response, the ruling-ANC replaced the mayor - but it has not touched the council members. In frustration, the activists filed a court motion to have the municipality dissolved for failing to provide a safe living environment for residents. The matter is still before the court.

Image: Cyril Ramaphosa has an idea of the South Africa he wants

""Here's the question,"" says Ayanda Kota of the Unemployed People's Movement. ""Do we allow this town to sink into a black hole or do we do something to get it out? If we are going to save it, we have to do it together.

""Everyone has got to part of the conversation - poor people from the townships on the eastern side of town and the better-off from the west.""

Frustrated by the potholes and piles of rubbish, Mr Weissenberg's Makana Revive organisation has raised funds and carried out basic community works - including running their own refuse collection service.

Image: David Mabuza has been implicated in a litany of crimes

The city's business federation has taken the electricity utility, ESKOM to court. Their initiative has kept the lights on - at least for the time being.

""Lots of people have made contributions. Some chip in money. Others donate labour. We can't rely of government to solve all our problems,"" says Mr Weissenberg.

There are limits to what the residents can do. The cost of replacing the water and sewage system is beyond the means of ordinary residents but they can pressure their elected representatives do it for them.

Decade of corruption leaves former South African City of Saints in the dumps

Few places in Africa are blessed like Grahamstown, a community of 70,000, nestled amid the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape in South Africa.

It boasts a fine university called Rhodes and several prestigious private schools. The country's largest arts festival takes over the community's auditoria and public spaces during June and July and the locale's 40-odd churches have earned it the nickname City of Saints.

However, there is nothing holy about Grahamstown's current situation. After a decade of corruption and blinding incompetence at the hands of local, provincial and national politicians, this saintly city is in the veritable dumps.

The charge sheet is lengthy. For one, the near-total neglect of the municipal water system has created a health and sanitation crisis. Untreated sewage runs freely in parts of town and the supply of drinking water has nearly collapsed.

""This is a man-made disaster created by members of a municipal council who have no idea or experience of how to manage it,"" says businessman and activist Ron Weissenberg.

The local government cannot pay its electricity bills and the national utility ESKOM has threatened to cut the city off. Nor can it afford to administer to the potholes or the piles of rubbish which dot the community. Locals told us that patients in Grahamstown's hospital routinely sleep on the floor.

The flailing municipality did get a name change however - last year, the Minister for Arts and Culture changed Grahamstown to Makhanda - the name of a Xhosa warrior who fought against land dispossession at the hands of British settlers.

Image: The city had worked hard for its glowing reputation

It took two centuries for Grahamstown - or Makhanda - to establish itself as an orderly and picturesque locale. Yet it has fallen fast and it shares this decline with dozens of other communities across the country.

In 2018, the government admitted that only 7% of the country's 257 municipalities could be considered ""well-functioning"". At least 87, including Grahamstown, were classed as ""distressed or dysfunctional.""

The co-operative governance minister, Zweli Mkhize, blamed ""political instability, interference, corruption and incompetence"".

This extraordinary failure to govern - to provide for basic needs and services - is the responsibility of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). It may have liberated the nation when former leader Nelson Mandela swept the apartheid regime aside, but as a party of sound administration it has failed.

A couple of weeks ago, South Africans gave the ANC's new leader, 66-year-old Cyril Ramaphosa, a chance to clean up the mess when he won a reduced majority of 57% in the national election. Without the respected activist-turned businessman in charge, analysts think the ANC would have been lucky to scrape 40%.

Mr Ramaphosa has promised to fight for a country where ""public servants faithfully serve no other cause than that of the public"", yet he is now struggling to balance this commitment with the need to reward party allies who backed his leadership bid.

ANC realpolitik has already intervened. Powerful party figures like former provincial premier David Mabuza expect payback for their support and Mr Ramaphosa has just appointed him deputy president - despite the fact that Mr Mabuza has been implicated in a litany of crimes, including conspiracy to murder, money laundering and fraud.

The rot has spread so extensively in South Africa that few think Mr Ramaphosa can fix it on his own - something the residents of Grahamstown know instinctively.

""You can't leave politics to the politicians,"" says Philip Machanick, a computer science professor at Rhodes who also heads the residents' association.

""We have to be involved. We have to help them do their job.""

This rallying cry for a form of total-community politics has been embraced by a diverse group of people in Grahamstown.

City estate agents joined forces with members of the Unemployed Peoples' Movement and created a petition calling for the removal of the local council. Within weeks 22,000 people had signed up.

In response, the ruling-ANC replaced the mayor - but it has not touched the council members. In frustration, the activists filed a court motion to have the municipality dissolved for failing to provide a safe living environment for residents. The matter is still before the court.

Image: Cyril Ramaphosa has an idea of the South Africa he wants

""Here's the question,"" says Ayanda Kota of the Unemployed People's Movement. ""Do we allow this town to sink into a black hole or do we do something to get it out? If we are going to save it, we have to do it together.

""Everyone has got to part of the conversation - poor people from the townships on the eastern side of town and the better-off from the west.""

Frustrated by the potholes and piles of rubbish, Mr Weissenberg's Makana Revive organisation has raised funds and carried out basic community works - including running their own refuse collection service.

Image: David Mabuza has been implicated in a litany of crimes

The city's business federation has taken the electricity utility, ESKOM to court. Their initiative has kept the lights on - at least for the time being.

""Lots of people have made contributions. Some chip in money. Others donate labour. We can't rely of government to solve all our problems,"" says Mr Weissenberg.

There are limits to what the residents can do. The cost of replacing the water and sewage system is beyond the means of ordinary residents but they can pressure their elected representatives do it for them.

6,Nord Stream 2: The Russian gas pipeline 'salami slicing' through NATO,Diana Magnay,"Huddled around a skidoo, the group of locals selling frozen fish to Gazprom employees in northern Russia makes for a forlorn picture.

What were once pastures for their reindeer are now a criss-cross of pipes and the paraphernalia of big energy.

Gas production and transportation firm Gazprom has built reindeer crossings covered with a special geotextile fabric, so that the herders' sledges can pass through.

It is small consolation for the loss of your ancestral homelands on the Yamal peninsula, 400km north of the Arctic Circle.

It is winter here for three quarters of the year. It is sparsely populated - average density is just one person per nine square kilometres.

Image: The Yamal peninsula is the source of gas that will use the Nord Stream 2 pipeline

What there is a lot of, deep beneath the permafrost, is natural gas.

The Bovanenkovo gas field alone, the largest of several on the Yamal peninsula, has reserves of 4.9 trillion cubic metres of natural gas.

That's more than the whole of Europe, Norway and the North Sea combined. And Gazprom has just made another windfall discovery of two more gas fields just off the Yamal shelf.

Bovanenkovo is also the source of gas for one of the most politically heated infrastructure projects of all time.

Nord Stream 2 is the £9.5bn off-shore pipeline which will bring Russian gas through the Baltic Sea, directly to Germany.

Image: The yellow line marks the route of Nord Stream 2

It is due for completion by the end of this year, exactly when Gazprom's supply and transit deal with Ukraine comes up for renewal. Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller admitted earlier this month there could be minor delays.

The US is mulling sanctions on companies involved with Nord Stream 2. Denmark is prevaricating about allowing the pipeline to pass through its waters.

Eastern European transit countries fear it is a way of bypassing their pipelines and strengthening Russia's hand in contract negotiations. The EU is looking to regulate it with a new gas directive, called Lex Nord Stream.

'Minor delays' could be putting a rosy spin on it.

Image: How Nord Stream 2 will avoid Ukraine

Donald Trump has called it a ""horrible project"".

At Chequers, last year, on his last trip to the UK, the US president described Nord Stream 2 as ""a tragedy and a horrific thing being done, feeding billions of dollars from Germany and other countries into the coffers of Russia when we're trying to do something to have peace in the world"".

World peace aside, the US also wants to sell its liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe so he has additional incentives, but Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was quick to agree with Mr Trump on the grounds that he considers Nord Stream 2 a threat to European energy security.

Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee told Sky News: ""It is not really an energy project. The truth is that if you want gas from Russia to get to Western Europe the existing pipelines exist.

Image: Chair of the Commons foreign affairs select committee Tom Tugendhat

""What Nord Stream 2 does is salami slice NATO by cutting some of the Eastern European countries away from the Western ones and particularly Germany.

""What that means is it allows Russia to circumvent and take action against countries like Ukraine whilst at the same time maintaining gas supply to Germany so it has still has money coming in.""

It wasn't so long ago that Russia did turn off the gas taps to Europe in the pricing dispute gas wars with Ukraine in 2006 and 2009.

That was before Russia's annexation of Crimea and the waging of a proxy war in Ukraine's east, so expect Ukraine's upcoming contract negotiations with Gazprom to be especially fraught - just one of new President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's myriad challenges.

Image: The gas refinery at the Bovanenkovo gas field

If no deal is done by 31 December and Nord Stream 2 isn't completed, European consumers could find themselves short of gas over winter, so the clock is ticking.

The company behind Nord Stream 2 argues the pipeline adds much needed supply capacity at a time when European gas reserves are diminishing and insists it will supplement, not replace, Ukrainian transit.

They reject the suggestion the pipeline furthers the Kremlin's geopolitical interests in Europe.

""You are talking to a project developer representing Western investors who spent approximately a billion euros each, not a spokesperson for the Kremlin"", Nord Stream 2 spokesman Jens Mueller told Sky News.

""Those investors should be able to rely on the rule of law and on certainty for a huge infrastructure project.""

Gazprom currently exports 65% of its gas supplies to Europe and only 9% to other export markets.

Image: Tundra dwellers in the Bovanenkovo gas field

But just as Europe is looking to diversify its supply and energy mix, in part to wean itself off a historic dependence on Russian gas, so Russia is trying to diversify its export markets and is in the process of building another gigantic pipeline through Siberia to China as well as the South Stream pipeline to Turkey

What are the Nord Stream pipelines?

Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 are two off-shore pipeline routes which will bring natural gas directly from Russia's coast through the Baltic Sea to Germany. Nord Stream was completed in 2012. Nord Stream 2 is due for completion by the end of 2019.

Who's behind it?

Gazprom and a consortium of European investors. ENGIE, OMV, Royal Dutch Shell, Uniper and Wintershall. Each company will fund up to €950m.

Why does Russia want to build it?

For Gazprom, pipelines carrying gas directly to the end consumer are quicker and more cost effective than relying on transit countries like Ukraine, Belarus and Poland. The company has to pay less in transit fees. It also increases its commercial leverage over countries along transit routes.

Image: Diggers working on one of Russia's international gas pipelines

What about the transit countries?

There are two major transit pipelines bringing Russian gas to Europe. The Brotherhood pipeline goes through Ukraine, Slovakia and the Czech Republic; the Yamal-Europe pipeline goes through Belarus and Poland. Both need substantial investment. Arguably, the former Soviet states should diversify their energy mix if they want to rely less on heavily subsidised gas from a neighbour they consider hostile.

What's it got to do with the US?

The US wants to sell LNG to Europe. Geopolitically, the US is a more reliable energy partner than Russia with a strong commitment to European security through NATO (of which energy security is a component). The US feels that while it stumps up huge sums for NATO, Germany is allowing Russia in through the back door with a huge commercial deal like Nord Stream 2.

What's the UK's view on it?

The UK does not import Russian gas but it does have companies involved in Nord Stream 2 especially in the offshore gas contractor sector. Plus Anglo-Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell is one of the Nord Stream 2 main investors. The UK's foreign policy establishment consider the pipeline a political project and a threat to European energy security. The business community aren't so sure.

Image: The Bovanenkovo gas field

Who benefits?

German businesses get cheaper, readier supply of Russian gas. In theory, so should the European consumer too. EU domestic gas production is set to fall 50% over the next 20 years while gas demand is expected to remain stable. Europe needs to fill its import gap somehow - either through LNG or pipeline gas.

What about the environment?

Nord Stream 2 argues a modern pipeline is more carbon efficient than the old transit pipelines and more environmentally friendly than LNG (no fracking or liquefaction energy expenditure). But fossil fuels are fossil fuels, no matter how you cut it. If Europe invested more in renewables, they would not have to depend so heavily on Russia for their energy needs at a time when relations with Russia are strained.","Nord Stream 2 is the £9.5bn off-shore pipeline which will bring Russian gas through the Baltic Sea, directly to Germany.

8,Trump's threatened Mexico tariffs may never happen,Greg Milam,"Donald Trump's threatened sliding scale of escalating tariffs on imports from Mexico may never become reality.

Remember his threat to close the US-Mexico border? It came to nothing.

But the mere threat of punitive action by the United States against its neighbour to the south is enough to move markets and spook the business community.

The trading relationship between the two countries is worth billions and Americans rely on imports from Mexico for everything from cheap fruit and vegetables to cars, tractors and beer.

Whatever Mr Trump says or believes about who actually pays for the tariffs, most economists agree that ultimately it is the consumer who feels it in the wallet. His own economic adviser has admitted as much on television.

The farmers of the Midwest can attest to the financial impact of the tariffs imposed as part of the trade war with China. The US government has had to bail them out.

The latest move poses two questions: Are trade tariffs a legitimate tool in a dispute over immigration? And do they work?

Mr Trump is the man who said that trade wars were good things and that they were easy to win. He has yet to prove this in office.

In fact, the new trade deal agreed with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA has not been ratified by Congress, much to Mr Trump's irritation. This will stymie any efforts to move things along.

'Our country is full', Trump claims emergency during border visit

Finding a solution to the trade dispute with China has been more difficult. And Beijing may now wonder about doing a deal with a country prone to imposing new tariffs seemingly on a whim.

The US had only just lifted tariffs on Mexican steam and aluminium before this week's renewed threat.

Mr Trump's base support seems to like his tough talk on trade and immigration. They may well cheer his new tariffs, whatever the personal cost to them.

But even some in his own party have made it clear they believe tariffs are a mistake, a costly one for Americans. These are the people not prone to defying Mr Trump usually.

The president believes the action is merited because of what he sees as a national emergency on the border. But economic retribution towards a friendly neighbour makes those schooled in diplomacy uneasy.

Mr Trump will hope the threat alone will prompt the action he wants from the Mexican authorities.

If not, millions will feel the economic pain.","Donald Trump's threatened sliding scale of escalating tariffs on imports from Mexico may never become reality.

10,EU patience wearing thin over Italy's finances,Ian King,"Matteo Salvini says he will use 'all my energy to change [the EU's] old and outdated rules'

It feels as if the Eurozone could be on the point of one of its periodic bouts of turbulence.

A simmering row between the European Commission and Italy's populist coalition government over the latter's budget proposals finally looks to be coming to a head.

Brussels formally warned Italy today that it is in breach of EU budget rules, set in the Maastricht Treaty 27 years ago, which govern how much member states may spend or borrow.

The rules require member states to keep their budget deficit within 3% of GDP and their overall national debt within 60% of GDP.

The latter point is, to an extent, somewhat irrelevant as most EU members broke that particular rule some time ago, including France, the UK, Spain and Germany - although Italy, whose national debt now stands at 132.2% of the country's GDP, has broken it more spectacularly than any country other than Greece.

It is, though, a problem for Italy if the Commission decides that its government has not done enough to try to reduce its debts.

That certainly appears to be the case.

In its report on Italy's public finances, published today, the Commission said: ""The Commission expects the debt ratio to rise in both 2019 and 2020, up to over 135% [of GDP], due to a large debt-increasing 'snowball' effect, a declining primary surplus, and underachieved privatisation proceeds.

While refinancing risks remain limited in the short term, the high public debt remains a source of vulnerability for Italy's economy.""

Equally worrying for the Commission is Italy's breach of the 3% rule.

In its report today it said that, while it expects Italy's budget deficit to be 2.5% of GDP in 2019, it expects this to rise to 3.5% in 2020.

Both Brussels and Rome have been here before.

The Commission looked set to launch disciplinary proceedings against Italy late last year until Rome committed in December to lowering the deficit this year.

This time, Rome appears to be in no mood to back down, not least because deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini's far-right League put in a strong showing in the recent elections for the European Parliament.

Mr Salvini, who wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, gave a strident interview to Italian radio on Tuesday in which he said the EU's fiscal rules were obsolete.

He added: ""I'll use all my energy to change these old and outdated rules.""

The next step will be for the EU's Economic and Financial Committee, a group of senior finance ministry officials and central bankers from member states, to decide whether they support the Commission's assessment.

There has to be a fair chance that this happens because the committee is currently headed by Hans Vijlbrief, a senior official from the Netherlands, a country which has continually called for firmer action against those who flout the EU's fiscal rules.

If the committee does support the Commission, the latter could at any time formally open disciplinary proceedings against Italy, which, if found guilty, could be required to post a deposit worth 0.2% of Italian GDP - around €3.5bn (£3.1bn) - with the Commission.

This would be dramatic stuff indeed.

Ever since the EU's fiscal rules were set, it has never punished a member state for breaking the rule on excessive debt.

Nor has it fined any country for breaking the deficit rules partly, critics say, because France has been one of the most persistent offenders.

But its patience with Italy is clearly running thin.

Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice-president responsible for the Eurozone, said today: ""Italy pays as much in [servicing its debts] as it does for the entire education system.

""In 2018, Italy's debt represented an average burden of €38,400 (£34,000) per inhabitant, and in addition the average debt servicing cost was around €1,000 (£884).

""We know there is a path to recovery and growth to Italy.

""This path follows a renewed reform effort, not spending more where there is no fiscal space to do so.""

His comments drew an immediate response from Luigi Di Maio, Italy's other deputy prime minister, whose populist Five Star Movement is in coalition with the League.

The pair have not agreed on much recently, raising concerns the coalition may fall apart, but today Mr Di Maio said: ""For years we've been giving without receiving [from the Commission], or we receive less than what we were due, we've been completely ignored for years on the matter of migrants, for instance.

""We bear all the weight, and as if that were not enough, they're lecturing us.

""We will go to Europe and discuss responsibly, so we can construct and not destroy.

""But it's tough, when you see that every day they find another reason to say bad things about Italy and this government.""

Making the differences of opinion with Brussels even more explosive has been news that members of Mr Salvini's party have revived the idea of Italy's government launching a 'parallel currency'.

The idea would see Italy's Treasury issue small-denomination mini-bills of treasury (mini-bots), of around €100 a time, that could be used by the government to settle accounts with businesses or by citizens to pay their taxes.

The proposal resembles an idea floated by Yanis Varoufakis, the hard-left former finance minister of Greece, during his country's debt crisis in 2015.

And that it is even being discussed in Rome suggests the Italian government will use it in forthcoming talks with Brussels to threaten a possible 'Italexit' from the Eurozone.

The row is already unsettling investors.

The Italian stock index, the MIB, was the only major European stock index to fall today as Italian banking stocks wobbled.

And the yield - the implied cost of borrowing - on Italian 10-year government bonds briefly jumped from 2.525% to 2.631% on a day in which bond yields were falling elsewhere in Europe.

When Italy's populist government was elected last year, markets initially took it in their stride, before realisation dawned that it was being heavily influenced by some long-standing opponents of Italy's membership of the euro.

Last year, utilising the EU's time-honoured skill of applying gallons of fudge, a clash between Brussels and Rome was averted.

11,EU patience wearing thin over Italy's finances,Business Presenter,"Matteo Salvini says he will use 'all my energy to change [the EU's] old and outdated rules'

It feels as if the Eurozone could be on the point of one of its periodic bouts of turbulence.

A simmering row between the European Commission and Italy's populist coalition government over the latter's budget proposals finally looks to be coming to a head.

Brussels formally warned Italy today that it is in breach of EU budget rules, set in the Maastricht Treaty 27 years ago, which govern how much member states may spend or borrow.

The rules require member states to keep their budget deficit within 3% of GDP and their overall national debt within 60% of GDP.

The latter point is, to an extent, somewhat irrelevant as most EU members broke that particular rule some time ago, including France, the UK, Spain and Germany - although Italy, whose national debt now stands at 132.2% of the country's GDP, has broken it more spectacularly than any country other than Greece.

It is, though, a problem for Italy if the Commission decides that its government has not done enough to try to reduce its debts.

That certainly appears to be the case.

In its report on Italy's public finances, published today, the Commission said: ""The Commission expects the debt ratio to rise in both 2019 and 2020, up to over 135% [of GDP], due to a large debt-increasing 'snowball' effect, a declining primary surplus, and underachieved privatisation proceeds.

While refinancing risks remain limited in the short term, the high public debt remains a source of vulnerability for Italy's economy.""

Equally worrying for the Commission is Italy's breach of the 3% rule.

In its report today it said that, while it expects Italy's budget deficit to be 2.5% of GDP in 2019, it expects this to rise to 3.5% in 2020.

Both Brussels and Rome have been here before.

The Commission looked set to launch disciplinary proceedings against Italy late last year until Rome committed in December to lowering the deficit this year.

This time, Rome appears to be in no mood to back down, not least because deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini's far-right League put in a strong showing in the recent elections for the European Parliament.

Mr Salvini, who wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, gave a strident interview to Italian radio on Tuesday in which he said the EU's fiscal rules were obsolete.

He added: ""I'll use all my energy to change these old and outdated rules.""

The next step will be for the EU's Economic and Financial Committee, a group of senior finance ministry officials and central bankers from member states, to decide whether they support the Commission's assessment.

There has to be a fair chance that this happens because the committee is currently headed by Hans Vijlbrief, a senior official from the Netherlands, a country which has continually called for firmer action against those who flout the EU's fiscal rules.

Neymar questioned after posting images and messages from his rape accuser on social media

Brazilian footballer Neymar has given testimony at a Rio de Janeiro police station in an investigation linked to a woman's rape allegation against him.

He was questioned by detectives for almost two hours after he posted images and messages from his accuser on social media without her permission - a potential violation of her online privacy.

Najila Trindade, a 26-year-old woman also from Brazil, has alleged that Neymar raped her in a Paris hotel room and became aggressive after she refused to have unprotected sex.

Neymar rape accuser speaks out

The footballer denies the allegation and says he is the victim of attempted blackmail - and his lawyer said she ""fully trusted"" he would be found innocent.

Using crutches because of an injured right ankle, Neymar told reporters after his testimony: ""I only want to thank the support and messages that everybody sent.""

The social media posts he shared were meant to show that Ms Trindade had spoken to him on friendly terms following the alleged incident.

Image: Neymar is one of football's biggest stars

On Instagram last weekend, the Paris Saint-Germain forward posted a seven-minute video in which he insisted the accusation was a ""setup"".

The video included intimate images and WhatsApp messages he says he exchanged with Ms Trindade.

Neymar said: ""There was a relationship between a man and a woman between four walls.

""Anyone who knows me, knows of my behaviour, knows that I would never do something like that.""

Image: Neymar plays for French champions Paris Saint-Germain

Ms Trindade's lawyer, Danilo Garcia de Andrade, said Neymar ""exposed (posted) the body of a woman, he exposed (posted) the intimacy of a woman in the social media, and that is pornography"".

The rape allegation against Neymar is being investigated separately in Sao Paulo, where Ms Trindade filed a formal complaint with police last Friday.

Neymar is expected to speak to authorities concerning that allegation in the next few days - and she is expected to testify later on Friday.

Speaking to the Brazilian TV station SBT, Ms Trindade said she was the victim of ""aggression together with rape"".

""I said: 'Stop it, stop it, stop it.' He did not communicate, he just acted,"" she claimed.

Image: Neymar was questioned by police for two hours for posting images of the woman on social media

On Thursday, a video emerged on social media which appears to show the pair in a physical altercation in a hotel room.

The footage was shot from a partially hidden location by Ms Trindade, and shows the pair fighting each other.

Ms Trindade's lawyer said the video was filmed to prove Neymar can be aggressive and the footage is much longer than the short clip published, according to local media.","Neymar questioned after posting images and messages from his rape accuser on social mediaNeymar questioned after posting images and messages from his rape accuser on social mediaBrazilian footballer Neymar has given testimony at a Rio de Janeiro police station in an investigation linked to a woman's rape allegation against him.

MPs to question Huawei over the security risks to 5G networks

Huawei is set to appear before a committee of MPs over security risks

MPs will question Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on Monday as part of a parliamentary inquiry into security risks around 5G.

The science and technology committee is investigating what dangers the next generation of mobile networking equipment could pose to the UK.

American officials have warned that Huawei equipment could be exploited by Beijing for espionage or sabotage purposes - and have called for it to be banned in the face of such risks.

A leak from a National Security Council meeting in April suggested that Theresa May had approved Huawei's bid to help build Britain's 5G network.

But the government has since said no decision has been taken on whether the Chinese company, which is facing significant sanctions in the US, can play a role in UK networks.

Also appearing before the committee on Monday are a number of academics and representatives from four of the largest telecoms companies in the UK.

The chief technology officers of O2, Three and Vodafone will be joined by the director of policy and public affairs for BT Group.

British-owned Vodafone, Spanish-owned O2 and Chinese-owned Three have significant exposure to Huawei equipment in their networks, as does BT although it has not installed any in its core network ahead of its 5G roll-out.

A UK government ban on including any Huawei kit in telecoms infrastructure is expected to delay the rollout of 5G considerably, potentially leaving the country at a competitive disadvantage.

The sanctions in the US have also had a huge impact on American companies which provide software and other technology as part of Huawei's consumer business.

Google said it is revoking Huawei's access to its Android mobile operating system to comply with the White House sanctions, leaving the company's new phones without any software to power them.

Microsoft, Facebook and chip-designing firm Arm have also suggested they would no longer work with Huawei due to the sanctions.

Image: NCSC's Ian Levy described Huawei's security as 'shoddy'

The announcement follows criticism of Huawei from Ian Levy, the technical director of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre.

Mr Levy told a conference in London that Huawei's security standards were ""shoddy"" according to Reuters, just months after writing an official report which criticised the company and called on it to improve.

It is understood that a government decision on Huawei will not be made until Mrs May's successor as prime minister has been appointed.","MPs to question Huawei over the security risks to 5G networksMPs to question Huawei over the security risks to 5G networksHuawei is set to appear before a committee of MPs over security risksMPs will question Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on Monday as part of a parliamentary inquiry into security risks around 5G.

Columbine High School could be demolished to stop it inspiring massacre fanatics

The 1999 Columbine shootings left 12 students and one teacher dead

Columbine High School, the scene of one of America's most notorious mass shootings, could be demolished.

Authorities in Colorado are assessing support for the school to be knocked down and rebuilt elsewhere, saying the building has remained a ""source of inspiration"" for those with a morbid fascination with the shooting.

Students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher in the 1999 massacre.

Image: Columbine High School could be rebuilt if authorities find there is enough support

After going on a killing spree in the school, the teenagers exchanged fire with police and then turned their guns on themselves.

The number of people trespassing on the school's grounds has reached a high this year - the 20th anniversary of the tragedy, said Jefferson County schools superintendent Jason Glass.

The 1999 massacre has sparked a number of attempted copycat attacks.

In April, the FBI began tracking down a teenager who was ""infatuated"" with the mass shooting and appeared to be planning an attack.

Sol Pais, 18, had travelled to Colorado from Miami and bought weapons from a store, but was later found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

In the UK, two schoolboys were found guilty of conspiracy to murder after plotting a Columbine-style attack on a North Yorkshire school.

The boys were said to have ""hero-worshipped"" the attackers and had put together a ""hit list"" of people they wanted to kill.

The former girlfriend of one of the boys claimed he described her as his ""Dylan Klebold"".

The district of Colorado has now released a survey to gauge support for a Columbine construction project up to the value of $70m (£55m).

One idea is to preserve the library built after the massacre and incorporate it into a new school building.

Earlier this year, a ceremony commemorating the 20th anniversary of the attack was held in a park near the school.

18,Bamburgh: Village with population of 400 ranked Britain's favourite seaside resort,Lucia Binding,"The village of Bamburgh has been ranked Britain's best coastal destination

A Northumberland village with a population of just 400 people has been ranked Britain's best coastal destination.

A poll of nearly 3,000 holidaymakers suggested Bamburgh in North East England is the country's most highly-rated seaside resort.

The village, notable for the nearby Bamburgh Castle, triumphed over better known and pricier locations, earning a customer score of 89% due to the quality of its beach, seafront, food and value for money.

In second place was the Italian Riviera-inspired Portmeirion in North Wales with a score of 88%.

At the bottom of the table were Bognor Regis, West Sussex and Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, which both earned a score of just 47%.

Bognor Regis, a seaside resort in West Sussex, received low points for its scenery and attractions.

Meanwhile Clacton in Essex, which has an average hotel room cost of £116, was rated poor for value for money in the poll, commissioned by consumer group Which?

20,Michael Gove: Tory leadership candidate 'deeply regrets' taking cocaine,Lucia Binding,"Michael Gove has admitted he used cocaine in the past

Michael Gove, one of the frontrunners in the Tory leadership race, has said he ""deeply regrets"" taking cocaine ""on several occasions"".

The Environment Secretary said he used the drug 20 years ago and called it ""a mistake"", the Daily Mail reported.

""I took drugs on several occasions at social events more than 20 years ago,"" Mr Gove told the newspaper.

""At the time I was a young journalist. It was a mistake. I look back and think 'I wish I hadn't done that'.""

Image: Mr Gove said he was a young journalist when he took the drug

He added: ""It was 20 years ago and yes, it was a mistake. But I don't believe that past mistakes disqualify you.""

Mr Gove, MP for Surrey Heath and former justice secretary, insisted his past mistakes should not be held against him as he battles the likes of Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab to replace Theresa May as prime minister - who stepped down as Tory leader yesterday.

He said it would be up to his colleagues whether he should be leader, but added that he did not ""act with an eye"" on going into politics when he was younger.

""The question now is that people should look at my record as a politician and ask themselves 'is this person we see ready to lead now?',"" he said.

Mr Raab, who has admitted taking cannabis as a student, has defended Mr Gove's actions saying he ""admires his honesty"".

He told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think Michael has set out that he made a mistake.

""It was a long time ago, people will judge it as it is but I do believe in a second chance society.""

Mr Raab added: ""I certainly don't feel it's barred him from this race in any way.

""I rather admire his honesty.""

Mr Gove reportedly admitted to taking drugs ahead of the publication of a book about him by journalist Owen Bennett.

The alleged admission comes after fellow Conservative contender Rory Stewart apologised for smoking opium at a wedding in Iran.

Speaking to Sky News last week, Mr Stewart admitted to making a ""very stupid mistake"" in relation to taking drugs.

The International Development Secretary told Sky News: ""I think it was a very stupid mistake and I did it 15 years ago, and I actually went on in Iran to see the damage that opium was doing to communities.""

He added: ""I've seen it as a prisons minister. It was something that was very wrong, I made a stupid mistake.

""I was at a wedding in a large community meeting and somebody passed this pipe around the room and I smoked it - I shouldn't have done, I was wrong.""

22,President Trump's tariff tactics could be bad news for China and EU,Greg Milam,"Mexican goods in Mexico City which are destined for the US

Business leaders, financial markets, the American consumer, even many Republican politicians - plenty will be breathing a sigh of relief that a trade war between the US and Mexico has been averted.

The alarm bells were ringing increasingly loudly as Monday's deadline loomed, when the first of a sliding scale of tariffs were due to be imposed by Washington.

For a relationship worth billions, economic catastrophe was predicted.

But Donald Trump can now claim that the threat - one that emerged out of the blue and against the advice of many in his administration - not only brought Mexico to the negotiating table but forced them to take urgent action to stem the flow of migrants from Central America up to the US border.

Image: Thousands of Mexican troops will be sent to the southern border with Guatemala

The numbers arriving have increased sharply in recent weeks, a situation Trump has described as a national emergency.

For a president who campaigned on controlling the border - but who has not been able to deliver that wall he promised - it called for drastic action.

And whatever anyone thinks of the Trump tactic of threatening economic punishment in exchange for diplomatic action, Trump will see this as a big win.

He will point to the thousands of Mexican troops heading to the country's southern border and tell critics: ""There, I told you so."" His loyal following will lap it up.

His claim that it might eliminate illegal migration from Mexico into the US altogether might be premature but Trump will feed emboldened by this.

Mexico may also have a different reading of what has been agreed - it has been known with this White House administration's diplomacy - and we must watch closely what happens next.

6 April: 'Our country is full' - Trump claims emergency during border visit

How will he respond, for example, if the flow of migrants from Central America does not slow immediately? It is certain to take time for Mexico's moves to take effect.

In a global sense, this could be bad news for China and, potentially, the European Union too.

If Trump feels that ramping up the talk of tariffs gets him what he wants, he is certain to resort it to more often.

He once said that trade wars were easy to win. There are few, even in his own administration, who agree.

We should expect to hear the threat of tariffs again in the future. The relief right now might be short-lived.

For all of those who fear their impact, it could be a rollercoaster of a few months.

As if we'd expect anything else from the president who loves to be unpredictable.","Image: Thousands of Mexican troops will be sent to the southern border with GuatemalaThe numbers arriving have increased sharply in recent weeks, a situation Trump has described as a national emergency.

24,Thomas Cook break-up looms as Fosun plots tour operator bid,Mark Kleinman,"The Chinese owner of Club Med is in secret talks to buy Thomas Cook's‎ tour operating business, paving the way for the potential break-up of the 178 year-old British travel company.

Sky News can exclusively reveal that Fosun Tourism Group - which is listed in Hong Kong and is already ‎Thomas Cook's biggest shareholder with an 18% stake - has indicated in recent days that it is preparing to make an offer for the bulk of the business.

Fosun is working with bankers at JP Morgan on an offer for ‎Britain's best-known tour operator.

Sources cautioned this weekend that a formal bid from Fosun was not yet guaranteed to emerge, and that discussions were at an early stage.

If successfully completed, it would rank among the most significant and prominent acquisitions of a British business by a Chinese rival to date.

It would hand control to Fosun of a business boasting almost £7.4bn in revenues last year, serving 11m customers and employing the majority of its 21,000-strong workforce.

A formal bid, w‎hich could come within weeks, would not include Thomas Cook's airline business, since Fosun would not be allowed to buy it under EU aviation ownership rules.

Thomas Cook, which has been enduring a torrid time as it battles to shore up its finances, has already launched an auction of its airline operations, which analysts believe could fetch around £1bn.

The terms of a potential offer from Fosun - an arm of which owns the Premier League football club Wolverhampton Wanderers - were unclear this weekend.

While Fosun knows Thomas Cook's business and management extremely well, a deal could be complex to execute and was likely to take months, even after any agreement with Thomas Cook's board.

Nevertheless, the approach by Fosun, which is likely to prohibit it from adding to its 18% stake while talks are ongoing, means the independence of one of Britain's best-known companies is likely to be nearing an end.

Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32 year-old cabinet-maker and former Baptist preacher who began offering one-day rail excursions from Leicester to loughborough for a shilling.

From there, it went on to become one of the world's largest holiday companies, marking its 175th anniversay three years ago.

The Chinese group has been a shareholder in Thomas Cook since April 2015, doubling its stake to 10% by the beginning of 2017.

It listed the entity which owns Club Med‎ in Hong Kong last year, and has continued to build its stake in the London-listed company ever since.

Thomas Cook and Fosun have a joint venture in China which is showing strong growth, with an eightfold increase in customers last year.

The introduction of own-brand resorts in the world's second-largest economy has also opened up the domestic Chinese market to Thomas Cook.

One source said the approach from Fosun underlined the range of options open to Thomas Cook's board as it seeks to resolve questions about its future.

Nevertheless, agreeing a transaction with its Chinese investor will be complicated by separate interest from Triton, a private equity firm, in acquiring Thomas Cook's airline and tour operating assets in northern Europe - revealed by Sky News last month.

‎Triton, which bought the travel company Sunweb Group last December, is seeking to buy a portion of Thomas Cook that collectively employs roughly 20% of Thomas Cook's workforce.



If a deal is struck between those parties, it would have a bearing on both Fosun's interest in the tour operating division and other talks that are taking place between Thomas Cook and suitors for its remaining airline operations.



The company's shares have fluctuated wildly in the past month amid severe turbulence prompted by a £1.5bn half-year loss.



Credit rating agencies have downgraded Thomas Cook, warning that the company's current debt structure is unsustainable as it seeks to expand its higher-margin own-hotel concepts and its online business‎.



Thomas Cook's travails have been exacerbated by demands from payment firms to hold onto millions of pounds of customers' money owed to Thomas Cook.



Its recent loss largely stemmed from a £1.1bn goodwill writedown relating to its 2007 merger with MyTravel.



Shares in the travel group have slumped by more than 85% during the last 12 months, and faced a further battering last month when analysts at Citi ascribed zero value to its equity.



EY, Thomas Cook's auditor, provided a going concern opinion on its accounts but warned that it faced ""material uncertainty"" without a deal to sell its airline business.



A new £300m winter debt facility - aimed at providing liquidity through the period when Thomas Cook's cash generation is at its annual low-point - has been offered by lenders, but only on the basis that it demonstrates progress selling the airline.



The company insists that that extra headroom will protect it in ""a worst-case scenario"".



Thomas Cook has become embroiled in an increasingly frantic bid to shore up confidence among consumers and lenders as it pointed to the absence of a Brexit deal's impact on customers' willingness to book overseas holidays during the crucial summer period.



Peter Fankhauser, chief executive, said the trading environment was ""weak"", and that ""continued competitive pressure resulting from consumer uncertainty is putting further pressure on margins"".



""This, combined with higher fuel and hotel costs, is creating further headwinds to our progress over the remainder of the year,"" he added.



Shares in Thomas Cook stand at just 16.11p, giving its equity a value of only £247m.



Prospective bidders, including Virgin Atlantic Airways, Lufthansa and Indigo Partners, a prominent aviation investor, are among those to have submitted non-binding offers for parts of its airline business.



Talks about the airline sale are complicated by the need to strike a deal for Thomas Cook's holiday customers to travel on its planes.



The company is working with advisers from AlixPartners on its balance sheet and cost reduction plans, while its syndicate of more than a dozen lenders is being advised by FTI Consulting.



Thomas Cook recently said it would close 21 high street shops and pare back its retail workforce as part of an attempt to exert a tighter grip on costs.



A much larger proportion of its 566-strong chain is likely to disappear in the coming years.



The entire sector is being ravaged by a brutal price war, while industry executives say uncertainty about the timing and nature of Brexit is prompting consumers to delay booking overseas holidays.

26,Peterborough by-election: Labour and Conservatives survive near miss,Sam Coates,"The two establishment parties both looked today like survivors from a near miss in Peterborough last night.

Labour defied the predictions of a Brexit Party win, holding on by 683 votes - just 2% of the electorate - after a solid get out the vote campaign building on months of work.

This will keep a lid, for now, on simmering tensions over Brexit, avoiding an immediate clash over whether the party should fully endorse a second referendum.

During a morning visit by Jeremy Corbyn to Peterborough, he made clear the party would continue with its policy to face both ways for now, having won in a seat which voted 61% for Brexit in 2016.

The lack of a pro-Remain and Liberal Democrat surge - they were on 12% of the vote - will reinforce this view in his office, as will the Green Party's performance on just 3% of the vote.

Perhaps oddly, the Conservatives were also quietly relieved.

The party came third, not the fifth place they saw a fortnight back in the EU elections.

One senior Tory told Sky News the 21% vote share represented a ""bloody lucky escape"" with the party's core vote - which helped elect a Conservative MP in 2010 and 2015 - holding up, even though the party lost more than half of the voters who supported them in 2017.

The result allowed the 11 leadership contenders to variously blame Brexit or the party's failure to occupy the centre ground for their defeat, depending on their pitch for the leadership.

They would be unwise, however, to be too complacent.

28,Theresa May's last day as Conservative leader: PM's highs and lows,Alan Mcguinness,"Theresa May's time in Downing Street is coming to an end

It started with a pledge on the steps of Downing Street to tackle ""burning injustices"", but Brexit sapped her energy and her time in office ended with an emotional goodbye.

On the day Theresa May resigns as Tory leader, here are the highs and lows of her time as prime minister.

'Submarine May' sinks her rivals

Image: Theresa May and her husband Philip celebrate after Andrea Leadsom's withdrawal leaves her as PM-in-waiting

As British politics reeled from the Brexit vote in the June 2016 referendum, the race to succeed David Cameron in Number 10 got under way.

Mrs May, who had been home secretary for six years under Mr Cameron, was not seen as the early favourite.

She had kept her head down during the campaign, save for one nuanced speech making a qualified case for Remain.

According to a book by Mr Cameron's spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver, his allies branded her ""Submarine May"" for disappearing when the PM needed her.

She surfaced with a well-received leadership pitch in which she declared: ""I'm Theresa May and I'm the best person to be prime minister.""

The path to power became a little clearer for Mrs May when presumed front-runner Boris Johnson stunned Westminster by revealing he would not be standing.

:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

She then emerged as the clear choice of Tory MPs in a series of ballots in Westminster, setting the stage for Mrs May to face off against then-junior minister Andrea Leadsom in a vote among party members.

But before this could happen, Mrs Leadsom quit the race over a controversial newspaper interview in which she suggested being a mother made her a better candidate than the childless Mrs May.

And that was that.

Mr Cameron brought forward his resignation and handed over power to Mrs May on 13 July 2016.

The woman who had wanted to be Britain's first female leader had made it to Downing Street, following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher.

May promises to build a 'better Britain'

Image: Mrs May said her government would be 'driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours'

Given Brexit came to dominate her premiership, it is ironic that Mrs May did not mention the word once in her first speech after becoming PM.

Instead, the focus was on building a ""better Britain"" and making it a ""country that works for everyone"".

Addressing those who were ""just managing"" to get by, she said: ""I know you're working around the clock, I know you're doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle.

""The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours.""

Strong PMQs debut evokes Thatcher comparisons

Image: Mrs May was compared to Margaret Thatcher after her PMQs debut

A week after becoming PM, Mrs May faced off against Jeremy Corbyn at the despatch box in the weekly clash between prime minister and leader of the opposition.

Facing a new opponent, the Labour leader sought to land a few blows by raising employment figures and unscrupulous bosses.

But Mrs May capitalised on disquiet with her opponent's leadership with a well-delivered jibe.

""I suspect that many Members on the Opposition Benches might be familiar with an unscrupulous boss,"" she began.

""A boss who does not listen to his workers, a boss who requires some of his workers to double their workload and maybe even a boss who exploits the rules to further his own career.

""Remind him of anybody?""

This delighted those on the Conservative benches and prompted a slew of favourable newspaper headlines comparing Mrs May with Mrs Thatcher.

'No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal'

Image: Theresa May's Lancaster House speech saw her set out her Brexit vision

This phrase, uttered in the first of many set piece Brexit speeches at Lancaster House in January 2017, was one of a few that came to define Mrs May's premiership.

Supporters saw it as evidence of her determination to fight for Britain and not give in to any outrageous demands from Brussels.

The front page of the following day's Daily Mail declared: ""Steel of the new Iron Lady"".

But critics saw it as an unrealistic negotiating gambit that did not stand up to scrutiny.

Downing Street stood by the claim for more than two years, despite most in Westminster deeming it highly unlikely that Mrs May would walk away from the talks and take Britain out of the EU without a deal.

Holds hands with Donald Trump

Image: Donald Trump and Theresa May hold hands during the PM's visit to Washington

Mrs May was the first foreign leader to meet the US president after his inauguration in January 2017.

The PM got Mr Trump to reaffirm his commitment to the NATO alliance and there were warm words from the president on the prospect of a post-Brexit free trade deal.

But one particular image came to define the trip.

As they walked in the grounds of the White House, the pair briefly held hands.

Some saw it as a good thing, an example of a new PM forging a close relationship with a valued ally.

But others said it sent the wrong message amid criticism of the president over a range of misogynistic comments.

The Brexit countdown begins

Image: Mrs May signs the letter triggering Article 50

After fleshing out her negotiating aims for Brexit in her first few months in office, including confirming she wanted to leave the EU's single market and customs union, Mrs May formally set the clock ticking on Britain's exit.

Mrs May had insisted it was up to the government to trigger Article 50, but campaigner Gina Miller launched a successful High Court challenge which required a vote from MPs.

This was a minor setback, given MPs approved triggering Article 50 by an overwhelming majority.

Formally invoking the clause on 29 March 2017 was a significant moment in her premiership and British history.

In her letter to Brussels, Mrs May said she was giving effect ""to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom"" and wanted to strike a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU.

""The task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us,"" the PM declared.

Addressing MPs in the Commons, she told them: ""This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.""

Snap election gamble backfires

Image: Mrs May shocked Westminster by calling a snap election

Despite Downing Street insisting for months that a general election was not on the cards, Mrs May announced her intention to go back to the people in April 2017.

The PM framed it as a chance for voters to strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations.

Initially, it looked like the decision would be a high point for Mrs May, with predictions of a landslide win come polling day on 8 June.

But as the campaign went on, such heady expectations were brought crashing back down to earth.

Image: A stony-faced Mrs May on election night

Oddly, Mrs May ran a presidential-style campaign, making herself the focus rather than sharing the limelight with her party and top team of ministers.

The PM seemed ill-suited to this (her harshest critics had dubbed her the Maybot for what they saw as her lack of emotion) - while a controversial manifesto appeared to alienate traditional supporters.

When the results came in, it was devastating for Mrs May.

She had lost her majority and found herself leading the largest party in a hung parliament.

Some argue that her authority never really recovered from this setback and it marked the beginning of the end.

'Nothing has changed'

Image: Mrs May faced the media after performing a u-turn on her social care reforms

One moment during the campaign has gone down in infamy, and it became totemic for Mrs May's critics.

She had decided to perform a U-turn on plans to get the elderly to pay for their social care, following a backlash.

Facing questions from journalists, she declared: ""Nothing has changed, nothing has changed.""

The phrase came to embody the criticism that she was ""robotic"" and unable to display the political agility of a good leader.

Weakened PM strikes a deal

Image: Mrs May with DUP leader Arlene Foster in Downing Street

Having been reduced to a minority government, Mrs May opted to do a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.

A confidence and supply deal - in which the DUP would back the Tories in key votes - seemed like a relatively prudent move to shore up her grip on power.

But it stored up future problems on Brexit and the thorny issue of the Irish border.

And the fact that Northern Ireland was given billions in extra funding blew a hole in the assertion that there was not any money to spend on other things (like pay rises for public sector workers).

Tragedy raises more questions

Image: Mrs May saw firefighters and other emergency service personnel

With Westminster still digesting the implications of the election, the country was left stunned by the Grenfell tragedy.

A fire at the west London tower block left more than 70 people dead.

Mrs May visited the site in the aftermath of the fire, but did not meet those affected.

Instead, she saw firefighters and other emergency service personnel.

This was in contrast to Mr Corbyn, who was pictured hugging those affected.

Again, this spoke to the criticism of Mrs May as somehow robotic and uncaring, that she just did not get it.

The PM later admitted her response was ""not good enough"" and said she would ""always regret"" not meeting residents first off.

May's Thick Of It Moment

Image: A comedian handed Mrs May a mock P45

Mrs May managed to steady the ship following the election disaster, with the threat of an immediate challenge to her receding.

But then came her speech at the 2017 conference. It is hard to overstate just how badly it went:

:: A comedian handed her a fake P45, saying ""Boris asked me to give you this"";

:: A bad cough left the PM unable to speak at times, with the chancellor at one point handing her a cough sweet;

:: The backdrop to the podium started to fall apart as she was speaking.

It reads like a rejected script for an episode of The Thick Of It. But it actually happened.

Scandal raises questions about immigration stance

Image: The 'Windrush' generation were named after the ship that brought one of the first large groups of West Indians to Britain

In 2018, stories began to emerge of British residents who were part of the ""Windrush"" generation facing immigration problems.

Named after the cruise ship that brought one of the first large groups of West Indians to Britain, anyone who entered the UK before 1973 is legally entitled to live in the country.

But some of those who moved to Britain from the Caribbean after the Second World War began to experience issues as a result of recently tightened UK immigration requirements.

In some instances, this even included being deported.

The scandal raised questions about Mrs May's hardline approach to immigration when she was home secretary, particularly her ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants.

The PM also lost a valuable ally as a result of the scandal, then-home secretary Amber Rudd.

Brexit tensions erupt

Image: Mrs May speaking to her Cabinet during crunch Brexit talks at Chequers

By the summer of 2018, Brexit was reaching a crunch point.

After months and months of debate, the time had come for Mrs May to nail her colours to the mast and set out exactly what kind of relationship she wanted Britain to have with the EU after Brexit.

In July 2018, she got her Cabinet to sign up to an agreement colloquially known as the Chequers Plan.

This proposed maintaining a ""common rulebook"" on goods trade with the EU, as well as ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules.

Parliament would have the ability to diverge from EU rules, but for many in her party this kind of relationship was too close.

They saw it as a betrayal of the referendum result.

This is when the Tory tensions over Brexit began to burst into the open.

Boris Johnson quit as foreign secretary, saying the PM's plan would reduce Britain to the ""status of a colony"".

David Davis also resigned from his role as Brexit secretary.

Dancing Queen

Image: Mrs May's dancing went down well in the conference hall

At the 2018 party conference, the pressure was on Mrs May.

She needed the speech of her life to shore up her position and convince her MPs that she could recover from a shaky few months.

In an unexpected turn of events, the PM strutted on stage to the ABBA hit Dancing Queen, a light-hearted nod to footage of her dancing during a recent trip to Africa that had gone viral.

Mrs May bought herself some breathing space with an assured address to the party faithful, even making light of her difficulties 12 months previously.

A deal is struck, but Brexit recriminations continue

Image: Mrs May leaving Downing Street

But as was the case throughout much of her time in Downing Street, trouble was not far away.

Mrs May managed to survive the bombshell resignations of Messrs Johnson and Davis, with a Brexit deal finally being struck with Brussels in November 2018.

Her Cabinet signed off on it, but there was not unanimous backing and more resignations soon followed.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Mr Davis' successor Dominic Raab went, as did Esther McVey, who quit her job as work and pensions secretary.

It quickly became clear that what should have been a triumph for Mrs May actually had the potential to be her undoing.

The DUP made clear they could not support the deal because of the controversial Irish border backstop, which they feared would imperil Northern Ireland's place in the union, a stance that dozens of Tory MPs agreed with.

Things were looking ominous.

Fed up MPs lose patience

Image: The 1922 Committee announces the result of the no confidence vote in Mrs May

As the clock ticked towards Christmas, there was no festive cheer for Mrs May.

Early in December she accepted political reality and delayed the first vote on her Brexit deal.

But this was the final straw for many of her MPs.

Dozens submitted letters calling for a vote of no confidence, and the threshold was to hold such a contest was reached.

In a quickly-arranged ballot, Mrs May came out on top by 200 votes to 117.

She was victorious but wounded.

The party was clearly unhappy with her, but they baulked at doing anything that could usher in a Corbyn government.

Under party rules, Mrs May was now safe from another challenge for a year.

Nothing had changed, to reprise an old phrase.

An unwanted place in history

Image: Mrs May takes in the first defeat on her Brexit deal

Mrs May made it to Christmas, but it was a case of new year, same problems.

Everyone in Westminster knew she was going to lose the first vote, it was just a question of how much.

When the result came, it was brutal.

The biggest defeat in modern British political history, 432 votes to 202.

In a tenure marked by low points, this was a nadir.

Mrs May had her place in political history, but not in the way she would have wanted.

Mr Corbyn attempted to get rid of the PM through a vote of confidence, but Tory MPs and the DUP rallied round to see off this threat.

Deadlock leads to delay

Image: Mrs May in Brussels after asking for a delay to Brexit

With Plan A out of the window, the last few months of Mrs May's premiership saw a number of different attempts to break the impasse.

Her deal was defeated a further two times, an attempt to change the backstop backfired and even a promise to quit if her deal was passed fail to sway her critics.

After the second defeat, MPs voted to rule out both no deal and to delay Brexit.

So with it clear that she could not take Britain out of the EU without a deal, Mrs May was forced to go back to Brussels and ask for a delay.

Having insisted for months that Britain would leave on 29 March 2019, this was something of profound regret for a PM who had staked her premiership on delivering Brexit.

To compound matters, Mrs May had to ask for a second delay, pushing Brexit day all the way back to October.

A further ignominy was heaped on her when MPs took control of parliamentary business and held a series of ""indicative votes"" on potential Brexit alternatives.

This ultimately went nowhere, but it was viewed as a further example of a PM who was in office but seemingly not in power.

She also stoked anger in her party by reaching out to Mr Corbyn and offering cross-party talks in an effort to break the impasse.

A tearful end

Image: Mrs May broke down as she said it had been 'the honour of my life' to be PM

The pressure finally told in May 2019, with the catalyst a last-ditch effort to pass a key piece of Brexit legislation. Included in this was a promise to offer MPs a vote on a second referendum if the bill passed.

Tories were mutinous.

Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom quit, while other ministers sought out Mrs May to make their feelings known.

She had run out of road and the game was up.

The PM emerged from Downing Street on Friday 24 May and announced that she would resign as party leader on 7 June, allowing the process of choosing her successor to begin.

Image: Mrs May sets out the timetable for her departure

Mrs May said he had ""done my best"" to sort out Brexit, but acknowledged she had failed.

Fighting back tears, she said she was leaving ""with no ill will"", adding that she was ""the second female prime minister but certainly not the last"".

Concluding her statement, Mrs May broke down as she said it had been ""the honour of my life"" to serve ""the country that I love"".

Having faced accusations of being emotionless and robotic, there was a rich irony in the fact that Mrs May displayed such vulnerability only at the end of her time in Downing Street.","Theresa May's time in Downing Street is coming to an endIt started with a pledge on the steps of Downing Street to tackle ""burning injustices"", but Brexit sapped her energy and her time in office ended with an emotional goodbye.

Mrs May visited the site in the aftermath of the fire, but did not meet those affected.

Instead, she saw firefighters and other emergency service personnel.

This was in contrast to Mr Corbyn, who was pictured hugging those affected.

Again, this spoke to the criticism of Mrs May as somehow robotic and uncaring, that she just did not get it.

The PM later admitted her response was ""not good enough"" and said she would ""always regret"" not meeting residents first off.

May's Thick Of It Moment

Image: A comedian handed Mrs May a mock P45

Mrs May managed to steady the ship following the election disaster, with the threat of an immediate challenge to her receding.

But then came her speech at the 2017 conference. It is hard to overstate just how badly it went:

:: A comedian handed her a fake P45, saying ""Boris asked me to give you this"";

:: A bad cough left the PM unable to speak at times, with the chancellor at one point handing her a cough sweet;

:: The backdrop to the podium started to fall apart as she was speaking.

It reads like a rejected script for an episode of The Thick Of It. But it actually happened.

Scandal raises questions about immigration stance

In 2018, stories began to emerge of British residents who were part of the ""Windrush"" generation facing immigration problems.

Named after the cruise ship that brought one of the first large groups of West Indians to Britain, anyone who entered the UK before 1973 is legally entitled to live in the country.

But some of those who moved to Britain from the Caribbean after the Second World War began to experience issues as a result of recently tightened UK immigration requirements.

In some instances, this even included being deported.

The scandal raised questions about Mrs May's hardline approach to immigration when she was home secretary, particularly her ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants.

The PM also lost a valuable ally as a result of the scandal, then-home secretary Amber Rudd.

Brexit tensions erupt

Image: Mrs May speaking to her Cabinet during crunch Brexit talks at Chequers

By the summer of 2018, Brexit was reaching a crunch point.

After months and months of debate, the time had come for Mrs May to nail her colours to the mast and set out exactly what kind of relationship she wanted Britain to have with the EU after Brexit.

In July 2018, she got her Cabinet to sign up to an agreement colloquially known as the Chequers Plan.

This proposed maintaining a ""common rulebook"" on goods trade with the EU, as well as ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules.

Parliament would have the ability to diverge from EU rules, but for many in her party this kind of relationship was too close.

They saw it as a betrayal of the referendum result.

This is when the Tory tensions over Brexit began to burst into the open.

Boris Johnson quit as foreign secretary, saying the PM's plan would reduce Britain to the ""status of a colony"".

David Davis also resigned from his role as Brexit secretary.

Dancing Queen

Image: Mrs May's dancing went down well in the conference hall

At the 2018 party conference, the pressure was on Mrs May.

She needed the speech of her life to shore up her position and convince her MPs that she could recover from a shaky few months.

In an unexpected turn of events, the PM strutted on stage to the ABBA hit Dancing Queen, a light-hearted nod to footage of her dancing during a recent trip to Africa that had gone viral.

Mrs May bought herself some breathing space with an assured address to the party faithful, even making light of her difficulties 12 months previously.

A deal is struck, but Brexit recriminations continue

Image: Mrs May leaving Downing Street

But as was the case throughout much of her time in Downing Street, trouble was not far away.

Mrs May managed to survive the bombshell resignations of Messrs Johnson and Davis, with a Brexit deal finally being struck with Brussels in November 2018.

Her Cabinet signed off on it, but there was not unanimous backing and more resignations soon followed.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Mr Davis' successor Dominic Raab went, as did Esther McVey, who quit her job as work and pensions secretary.

It quickly became clear that what should have been a triumph for Mrs May actually had the potential to be her undoing.

The DUP made clear they could not support the deal because of the controversial Irish border backstop, which they feared would imperil Northern Ireland's place in the union, a stance that dozens of Tory MPs agreed with.

Things were looking ominous.

Fed up MPs lose patience

As the clock ticked towards Christmas, there was no festive cheer for Mrs May.

Early in December she accepted political reality and delayed the first vote on her Brexit deal.

But this was the final straw for many of her MPs.

Dozens submitted letters calling for a vote of no confidence, and the threshold was to hold such a contest was reached.

In a quickly-arranged ballot, Mrs May came out on top by 200 votes to 117.

She was victorious but wounded.

The party was clearly unhappy with her, but they baulked at doing anything that could usher in a Corbyn government.

Under party rules, Mrs May was now safe from another challenge for a year.

Nothing had changed, to reprise an old phrase.

An unwanted place in history

Image: Mrs May takes in the first defeat on her Brexit deal

Mrs May made it to Christmas, but it was a case of new year, same problems.

Everyone in Westminster knew she was going to lose the first vote, it was just a question of how much.

When the result came, it was brutal.

The biggest defeat in modern British political history, 432 votes to 202.

In a tenure marked by low points, this was a nadir.

Mrs May had her place in political history, but not in the way she would have wanted.

Mr Corbyn attempted to get rid of the PM through a vote of confidence, but Tory MPs and the DUP rallied round to see off this threat.

Deadlock leads to delay

Image: Mrs May in Brussels after asking for a delay to Brexit

With Plan A out of the window, the last few months of Mrs May's premiership saw a number of different attempts to break the impasse.

Her deal was defeated a further two times, an attempt to change the backstop backfired and even a promise to quit if her deal was passed fail to sway her critics.

After the second defeat, MPs voted to rule out both no deal and to delay Brexit.

So with it clear that she could not take Britain out of the EU without a deal, Mrs May was forced to go back to Brussels and ask for a delay.

Having insisted for months that Britain would leave on 29 March 2019, this was something of profound regret for a PM who had staked her premiership on delivering Brexit.

To compound matters, Mrs May had to ask for a second delay, pushing Brexit day all the way back to October.

A further ignominy was heaped on her when MPs took control of parliamentary business and held a series of ""indicative votes"" on potential Brexit alternatives.

This ultimately went nowhere, but it was viewed as a further example of a PM who was in office but seemingly not in power.

She also stoked anger in her party by reaching out to Mr Corbyn and offering cross-party talks in an effort to break the impasse.

A tearful end

Image: Mrs May broke down as she said it had been 'the honour of my life' to be PM

The pressure finally told in May 2019, with the catalyst a last-ditch effort to pass a key piece of Brexit legislation. Included in this was a promise to offer MPs a vote on a second referendum if the bill passed.

Tories were mutinous.

Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom quit, while other ministers sought out Mrs May to make their feelings known.

She had run out of road and the game was up.

The PM emerged from Downing Street on Friday 24 May and announced that she would resign as party leader on 7 June, allowing the process of choosing her successor to begin.

Image: Mrs May sets out the timetable for her departure

Mrs May said he had ""done my best"" to sort out Brexit, but acknowledged she had failed.

Fighting back tears, she said she was leaving ""with no ill will"", adding that she was ""the second female prime minister but certainly not the last"".

Concluding her statement, Mrs May broke down as she said it had been ""the honour of my life"" to serve ""the country that I love"".

Having faced accusations of being emotionless and robotic, there was a rich irony in the fact that Mrs May displayed such vulnerability only at the end of her time in Downing Street.","Theresa May's time in Downing Street is coming to an endIt started with a pledge on the steps of Downing Street to tackle ""burning injustices"", but Brexit sapped her energy and her time in office ended with an emotional goodbye.
On the day Theresa May resigns as Tory leader, here are the highs and lows of her time as prime minister.
The woman who had wanted to be Britain's first female leader had made it to Downing Street, following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher.
This delighted those on the Conservative benches and prompted a slew of favourable newspaper headlines comparing Mrs May with Mrs Thatcher.

Women's World Cup: Eleve stars to watch from Houghton to Miedema

Some of the stars of the Women's World Cup

If Phil Neville’s England can match or better the team’s 2015 Women’s World Cup showing over the next few weeks in France, interest levels at home will be unprecedented.

Other nations have already had their breakthrough tournaments. For the USA it was as long ago as 1999.

Plenty did follow England's progress to the semi-finals four years ago, but middle-of-the-night kick-off times dented the viewing figures.

This time everything is set fair, from England's opening match against World Cup debutantes Scotland, through the proximity of the host nation, to the unpredictability of the winners.

Top four picks by world rankings and bookies' odds are the USA, Germany, England and France.

If you're watching, here are eleven names to look out for.

Steph Houghton

No apologies for starting with the England captain, a position the Manchester City defender has had for five years.

Forthright and eloquent off the pitch, a rock on it - and a goalscorer in England's run to the semis four years ago.

Expect extra attention on her role as carer for husband Stephen Darby, who retired last year as a Bolton Wanderers defender because of motor neurone disease.

Image: Steph Houghton

Marta

Brazil's captain has been world player of the year six times and has scored a record 15 World Cup goals.

Having first played as a child growing up in the poor town of Dois Riachos, she was number two on a recent list of the richest women footballers.

At 33, this is perhaps her last chance to win the World Cup - but in a team that's lost nine games in a row.

Image: Marta

Sam Kerr

Her Australia team will come up against Marta's Brazil in the group stage.

The former Australian Rules footballer now splits her year between Perth Glory and Chicago Red Stars - and is the all-time top scorer in both leagues.

Image: Sam Kerr

Mary Fowler

Another Aussie, but at 16 she is this World Cup's youngest player.

She has an Irish dad, and a brother called Seamus among four siblings with whom she chased a football every night after homework on a North Queensland beach.

Image: Mary Fowler

Erin Cuthbert

Another youngster, Scotland's 20-year old midfielder scored a stunning goal in last week's 3-2 warm-up win over Jamaica.

She was a mascot for an international match 12 years ago when the Scotland lineup included Shelley Kerr - who's now the manager who called Cuthbert in Majorca last month to tell her she was going to the World Cup.

Image: Erin Cuthbert

Megan Rapinoe

Even if she wasn't a skilful winger, you wouldn't miss the USA's 33-year old veteran of the 2015 World Cup win.

The LBGTQ equal rights campaigner calls herself ""a walking protest"", and at this tournament has pledged not to sing the national anthem.

Image: Megan Rapinoe

Ji So-yun

South Korea's youngest ever goalscorer at 15, she's now a veteran for her country and for Chelsea.

Masterful from free-kicks, and she may need to be if South Korea are to progress from a strong group including France.

Image: Ji So-yun

Wendie Renard

A trophy cabinet-maker's dream customer, Renard is captain of the world's top club Lyon, and a likely candidate to lift the World Cup on home soil on 7 July.

Makes defending look effortless, and a key figure as France aim to better their best World Cup finish of fourth in 2011.

Image: Wendie Renard

Vivianne Miedema

Main striker for the Netherlands, the 22-year old has broken all scoring records in England's Women's Super League and was voted player of the year by her fellow professionals.

She says she's starting to develop a Scottish accent because she hangs out with Arsenal's Scottish contingent.

Image: Vivianne Miedema

Kim Little

The Arsenal captain and world player of the year in 2013, the midfielder is in her prime at 28 and crucial to Scotland's hopes of progress at their first World Cup.

Played successful club football in the US and Australia, now scheming to upset England in their opening match.

Image: Kim Little

Beth Mead

It's impossible to watch the goal the 24-year old Arsenal striker belted in to help England beat Brazil in February without being excited.

Not certain to be in Phil Neville's starting eleven but still a decent bet to light up the tournament.

Someone else to help put her Yorkshire home town Whitby firmly on the map, after Dracula creator Bram Stoker and explorer Captain James Cook.","Women's World Cup: Eleve stars to watch from Houghton to MiedemaWomen's World Cup: Eleve stars to watch from Houghton to MiedemaSome of the stars of the Women's World CupIf Phil Neville’s England can match or better the team’s 2015 Women’s World Cup showing over the next few weeks in France, interest levels at home will be unprecedented.

36,How Chernobyl quietly became a huge TV hit,Gemma Peplow,"Without fanfare, Chernobyl has become unmissable TV.

The Sky Atlantic show, which concludes on Tuesday, is harrowing and unrelentingly bleak, with some complicated science to get to grips with.

It is also a western-made drama about a disaster that occurred in the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago, of which details such as the number of deaths are still debated. There was much that could go wrong.

And ultimately, we know how the story pans out.

But seemingly from nowhere, this five-part mini-series is now the show that everyone is talking about. (Sorry, Game Of Thrones).

After just three episodes, Chernobyl topped film and TV database IMDB's list of the greatest 250 TV shows of all time. It currently has a score of 9.7, based on more than 96,000 votes. Fan-voted charts obviously have their problems and are by no means definitive, but it is still quite an accolade for a drama series just four weeks and four episodes old.

To put it into context, Game Of Thrones (73 episodes and eight years old), scores 9.4, with more than 1.5 million reviews.

It is a gripping show. But what is it that has made the series so popular? We spoke to a nuclear scientist, a TV writer and a journalist who was born and raised in the Soviet Union to get their views.

Claire Corkhill, assistant professor in nuclear waste disposal at the University Of Sheffield

""I didn't know much about the show beforehand. I think quite often with dramas based around scientific events you tend to roll your eyes because there's a tendency to overdramatise, to elaborate, to put things in that aren't true just to make the story more interesting. But I was completely blown away by how accurate this is; there must have been so much research that has gone into it.

I’m really struck by how much these roof scenes look like the real thing – take a look for yourselves #Chernobyl pic.twitter.com/qUB7mi3S16 — Dr Claire Corkhill (@clairecorkhill) May 28, 2019

""There are tiny scientific details that are really accurate. There was a scene with the roof showing all the debris, the graphite, the twisted metal. They've done their research. And when it showed the firefighter exposed to the radiation and very sick early on, this is 100% true. People didn't die immediately, they were very sick and death came later.

""The story does tell itself. The historical event was extremely dramatic so you've got the basis for a good story, but there was so much that could have been done badly that wasn't. It's very clever.

""I think the reason it is doing well is first of all because it's a true story. Also, the writing itself is seamless.

""Watching the show I wanted to help the ordinary person understand some of the science behind it. I find when I talk to the public about nuclear waste people are always very interested. These are materials that are going to be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. The question is, 'what do we do with them?' I think the industry has an element of being shrouded in secrecy and it is the role of scientists to explain.

""I am surprised [it has been so popular] and really pleased by the interest. We generate 11% of the world's electricity from nuclear power and in the UK alone we have enough nuclear waste to fill Wembley Stadium. It's an issue that not many people think about.""

Chris Bennion, TV writer for The Times

""The very obvious and fundamental thing to say about Chernobyl is that it's very, very good. It's a really high quality, really classy drama from the top to the bottom; it's brilliantly written - which almost comes as a bit of a surprise as Craig Mazin was previously known for the Hangover 2 and 3, and now he comes through and writes this really powerful drama

:: Listen to Backstage on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

""The casting is superb and the detail is really, really spot on, from the costumes to the setting to the tiniest little things. It was clearly important for him to get it absolutely right.

""Another thing about its appeal, for us here in Britain and I'm sure lots of other places in the world, Chernobyl has always had this powerful effect on the imagination, something of the unknown and terrifying about it. It's almost amazing that it's taken so long for someone to do a proper serious drama about it because it is a source of endless fascination.

""They have also tapped into the idea of how Chernobyl almost signalled the death of the Soviet Union; it exposed some ugly truths to the world about what they'd been covering up. I think that's really interesting.

""I was looking forward to it [before it aired] but primarily because the cast was so good. The central three - Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgard, Emily Watson - I'd like to watch those three in anything. So I was looking forward to it but I didn't imagine it would be so serious. I thought it might be a bit more of a thriller, given a lighter treatment. Maybe glossier, slicker. Craig Mazin - and Johan Renck, who directed it, he's known for pop videos - have proved me wrong. It's remarkable and they have made some really bold choices. It's bold and brave and really mature, that's what's really impressed me.

37,How Chernobyl quietly became a huge TV hit,Arts,"Without fanfare, Chernobyl has become unmissable TV.

The Sky Atlantic show, which concludes on Tuesday, is harrowing and unrelentingly bleak, with some complicated science to get to grips with.

It is also a western-made drama about a disaster that occurred in the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago, of which details such as the number of deaths are still debated. There was much that could go wrong.

And ultimately, we know how the story pans out.

But seemingly from nowhere, this five-part mini-series is now the show that everyone is talking about. (Sorry, Game Of Thrones).

After just three episodes, Chernobyl topped film and TV database IMDB's list of the greatest 250 TV shows of all time. It currently has a score of 9.7, based on more than 96,000 votes. Fan-voted charts obviously have their problems and are by no means definitive, but it is still quite an accolade for a drama series just four weeks and four episodes old.

To put it into context, Game Of Thrones (73 episodes and eight years old), scores 9.4, with more than 1.5 million reviews.

It is a gripping show. But what is it that has made the series so popular? We spoke to a nuclear scientist, a TV writer and a journalist who was born and raised in the Soviet Union to get their views.

""I didn't know much about the show beforehand. I think quite often with dramas based around scientific events you tend to roll your eyes because there's a tendency to overdramatise, to elaborate, to put things in that aren't true just to make the story more interesting. But I was completely blown away by how accurate this is; there must have been so much research that has gone into it.

""The story does tell itself. The historical event was extremely dramatic so you've got the basis for a good story, but there was so much that could have been done badly that wasn't. It's very clever.

""Watching the show I wanted to help the ordinary person understand some of the science behind it. I find when I talk to the public about nuclear waste people are always very interested. These are materials that are going to be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. The question is, 'what do we do with them?' I think the industry has an element of being shrouded in secrecy and it is the role of scientists to explain.

39,Hampshire Police criticised for 'scandalous' response over 'racism' investigation,David Mercer,"A police force has been accused of a ""scandalous"" lack of transparency after refusing to divulge details of allegations that saw five members of staff suspended.

Hampshire Constabulary confirmed in February it was investigating 16 police officers and three civilian staff over claims by a force employee they used ""inappropriate and prejudiced"" language and behaviour.

The probe was launched last year after covert recording devices allegedly caught officers making racist and homophobic comments at the force's investigation centre in Basingstoke, according to reports.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, Sky News asked Hampshire Police to provide a short summary of complaints made against staff at the centre - since it opened in August 2017 - and the outcome of the force's investigation into the allegations.

But Hampshire Police told Sky News it does not hold the information ""in a retrievable format"" and it would cost too much to provide it.

""In order to ascertain a list of complaints against staff at the police investigation centre in Basingstoke, a large manual review would need to be undertaken,"" a force spokesman said.

""There are no means by which to search complaints by location and, as such, all complaints for the period in question would need to be reviewed to see whether they took place in the Basingstoke police investigation centre.""

A Hampshire Police spokeswoman later clarified that the investigation is still under way and it would be ""unable to provide any further information until it has been concluded"".

Anti-racism charity The Monitoring Group criticised the force's initial response and pointed to the damning inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which stressed the need for police to be more open about racism allegations.

Image: An inquiry into Stephen Lawrence's murder said police need to be open about racism allegations

The group's director Suresh Grover told Sky News: ""It is scandalous that police cannot be more transparent about the language that has been used.

""The Lawrence Inquiry recommendations stressed the ultimate need for authorities, especially police services, to be more open when investigating racist behaviour given that racism only ferments and spreads in secrecy.""

Mr Grover said the investigation into 19 police employees ""raises a number of serious concerns"", adding: ""The fact that it involves an investigation of a large group of staff members exposes the possibility of an existing office culture of prejudice, similar to the canteen culture that existed in police forces in the 1970s.""

Former cabinet minister Maria Miller, who is the MP for Basingstoke, told Sky News she planned to write to Hampshire Police and speak to the policing minister to raise her concerns.

She said: ""It's vital that the general public have confidence in the police and their ability to deal with any type of discrimination fairly, including racism.

""The police have to be transparent in their handling of these serious allegations and it is in the public interest for Hampshire residents to know whether the allegations made have been upheld or not and whether subsequent disciplinary action was taken.""

Five Hampshire Police employees were suspended and 11 were placed on restricted duties as part of the investigation, which began in February 2018.

41,Queen's birthday honours: Holocaust survivors and teen Asperger's pioneer awarded,Russell Hope,"Holocaust survivor Ruzena Levy and Richard Collins, who set up an Asperger's support group

A teenage Asperger's pioneer, a group of Holocaust survivors and a couple who help children caught up in domestic abuse are among those recognised in the Queen's birthday honours list.

Away from the star names, Sky News looks at some of the inspiring people who have been awarded gongs.

:: Richard Collins

A teenager who set up an Asperger's support group when he was 13 is among the people honoured in the Queen's birthday honours list.

Seventeen-year-old Richard is getting a BEM (British Empire Medal) for services to the community in Cookstown, County Tyrone.

He has Asperger syndrome and started his own support group, Team Aspie, four years ago.

Richard told Sky News: ""I'm still in shock. It's so amazing. Everything I do is for children. Seeing the joy in their faces is the reward and it's given me purpose.

""It started with three children and now supports 100 families. What we do is for the love of kids.""

Speaking about how he came up with the idea, he said: ""I asked mum if there was any group for 'aspies' (people with Asperger syndrome). Mum tried to find something but there was nothing that fitted. So we tried to start our own.""

:: Elizabeth and David Carney

The pair receive OBEs for their services to children caught up in domestic abuse.

They established a scheme to ensure the school of any child or young person exposed to, or involved in any police-attended domestic incident, is informed before the child returns to school.

The pair developed the role of ""key adult"", volunteers who now support thousands of children affected by domestic abuse.

The scheme is operating in 33 police forces, as well as internationally.

""Our aim has always been to allow the voice of the child who is a victim of domestic violence to be heard and to ensure that they are not left to one side, but put at the forefront of all the authority's actions,"" the couple said.

:: Walter Kammerling and Ernest Simon

A group of Holocaust survivors are also among those honoured.

They include Walter Kammerling, 95, and Ernest Simon, 89, who receive BEMs.

As boys, they left Austria for Britain on the Kindertransport and have shared their stories with 8,200 and 8,000 people respectively through the Holocaust Educational Trust's outreach programme.

42,Queen's birthday honours: Holocaust survivors and teen Asperger's pioneer awarded,News Reporter,"Holocaust survivor Ruzena Levy and Richard Collins, who set up an Asperger's support group

A teenage Asperger's pioneer, a group of Holocaust survivors and a couple who help children caught up in domestic abuse are among those recognised in the Queen's birthday honours list.

Away from the star names, Sky News looks at some of the inspiring people who have been awarded gongs.

:: Richard Collins

A teenager who set up an Asperger's support group when he was 13 is among the people honoured in the Queen's birthday honours list.

Seventeen-year-old Richard is getting a BEM (British Empire Medal) for services to the community in Cookstown, County Tyrone.

He has Asperger syndrome and started his own support group, Team Aspie, four years ago.

Richard told Sky News: ""I'm still in shock. It's so amazing. Everything I do is for children. Seeing the joy in their faces is the reward and it's given me purpose.

""It started with three children and now supports 100 families. What we do is for the love of kids.""

Speaking about how he came up with the idea, he said: ""I asked mum if there was any group for 'aspies' (people with Asperger syndrome). Mum tried to find something but there was nothing that fitted. So we tried to start our own.""

:: Elizabeth and David Carney

The pair receive OBEs for their services to children caught up in domestic abuse.

They established a scheme to ensure the school of any child or young person exposed to, or involved in any police-attended domestic incident, is informed before the child returns to school.

The pair developed the role of ""key adult"", volunteers who now support thousands of children affected by domestic abuse.

The scheme is operating in 33 police forces, as well as internationally.

""Our aim has always been to allow the voice of the child who is a victim of domestic violence to be heard and to ensure that they are not left to one side, but put at the forefront of all the authority's actions,"" the couple said.

:: Walter Kammerling and Ernest Simon

A group of Holocaust survivors are also among those honoured.

They include Walter Kammerling, 95, and Ernest Simon, 89, who receive BEMs.

As boys, they left Austria for Britain on the Kindertransport and have shared their stories with 8,200 and 8,000 people respectively through the Holocaust Educational Trust's outreach programme.

Coercive control: How do you spot it, what are your legal rights and how do you get help?

Sally Challen was the victim of coercive control carried out by her husband

Sally Challen's historic case has brought the use of coercive control in relationships to the public's attention.

Ms Challen, who spent nearly a decade behind bars for killing her abusive husband, walked free after a court accepted her guilty plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter.

Coercive control is an act or a pattern of behaviour which includes assaults, threats, and humiliating and intimidating the victim. It is not physical but is still used to harm and frighten.

:: How do you spot it?

Sky News spoke to one of the leading UK academics researching coercive control to help identify the signs of someone you know who may be in the midst of it.

Dr Rod Dubrow-Marshall, programme leader for the only masters course in the UK on the psychology of coercive control at the University of Salford, told Sky News:

Image: Rod Dubrow-Marshall highlights signs to look out for

""The picture of a happy smiling wife and husband may look like the calm waters of a loving relationship but sometimes below the surface there is a 'coercive control' iceberg that is psychologically and physically abusive and destructive.

""Coercive control is described as 'controlling and coercive behaviour' in the 2015 Serious Crime Act and the judgment in the case of Sally Challen shows how hard it can be to detect a pattern of psychological coercion which is systematically eroding a person's mind and humanity over months and years.

""Also known as gaslighting or brainwashing, the victim is completely dominated by the perpetrator in a psychological prison from which there is no easy escape.

""To wider family and friends then all may seem well, but closer inspection reveals a victim who loses interest in their hobbies, friends and work and is always at home doing the bidding of their partner.

""The importance of this detective work is paramount because if we all can become better at spotting the signs of coercive control then more victims will be rescued in the future and the tragic outcomes in the Challen family will be avoided.""

:: How can a lawyer help you?

Sky News also spoke with Aysen Soyer, the head of family law at Wilson Solicitors. She covers family work, including domestic violence and injunctions.

She says family lawyers are seeing more coercive control cases than in the past.

Image: Aysen Soyer: 'It is never a good idea to try to fight on alone'

""There are a number of legal steps victims of coercive control can take to protect themselves and their children from its potentially devastating effects.

""Family lawyers are seeing more and more of these cases, and are well versed in how to handle the issue carefully and sensitively. Due to the very nature of coercive control, it is never a good idea to try to fight on alone.

""People who suspect that they are the victim of coercive control must take steps to ensure their partner does not know that they are seeking legal advice, otherwise they will almost certainly be stopped.

""Once a meeting has been arranged, their lawyer can advise them on obtaining an injunction - generally either an occupation order or a non-molestation order.

""The former is something that victims who live with their partners can use to get them out of their house, and restrict them from coming within a certain distance from it.

""Some victims want to leave altogether, while others wish to stay where they are but not with their abuser. In these cases, an occupation order is the most appropriate.

""A non-molestation order is issued by the court and prevents a victim’s partner or ex-partner from threatening or intimidating them or their child, and is the most commonly used injunction. Breaching either type of injunction is an arrestable offence.

""When it comes to children, witnessing domestic abuse of any kind is extremely damaging.

""Women’s Aid has previously described children as 'hidden victims' of domestic abuse and that is absolutely right.

""Speaking to a family law specialist, and getting out of the situation, is crucial to protecting their physical well-being in the immediate - but their mental well-being in the weeks, months and years that follow must also be closely monitored and psychotherapy or counselling can be hugely beneficial.

""For those who know someone they suspect is a victim of coercive control, it is important that they keep the lines of communication open.

""Openly criticising their partner, or making them feel weak for failing to leave, will only push them further into their tormentor’s arms.

""Staying calm, being clear that what they are experiencing is wrong, and seeking expert legal advice early on is the best way to help someone experiencing coercive control break free.""

:: Where can you get help?

Thankfully, there are a number of organisations to help people who are victims of coercive control.

Anyone in a dangerous relationship should ensure they are in a safe environment before reaching out to avoid the abuser does not harm them further.

45,Peterborough by-election: Nigel Farage's swift exit is significant as Brexit Party bid fails,Jon Craig,"Nigel Farage's Brexit Party came within just under 700 votes of pulling off a by-election victory

For Nigel Farage, it was a night that began with dinner in a five-star hotel and ended with a bitter taste.

His Brexit Party came within just under 700 votes of pulling off a sensational by-election victory in Peterborough.

But in politics - as in everything else - there are no prizes for coming second and it's Labour and Jeremy Corbyn who are celebrating victory.

After a turbulent few weeks for the Labour leader, Lisa Forbes' win has earned Mr Corbyn some respite in his battle with the Remainers in his party demanding a second referendum.

Image: Peterborough by-election result

But not for long. Mr Corbyn's critics in his party will claim that this, after all, was a Labour held-seat and anything other than a victory for his party should have been unthinkable.

But these are not normal times in British politics and a Brexit Party victory looked on the cards throughout much of the by-election campaign.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says that the Peterborough by-election result shows that 2-party politics is over in national elections.

The party's spectacular 32% showing in the European elections provoked blind panic among Tory MPs and looks like propelling Boris Johnson, the only politician the Tories have who compares with Mr Farage's rock star status, to 10 Downing Street.

During polling day, bookmakers had Mr Farage's party at 1/5 and Labour 7/2, though later in the day they shortened Labour's odds to 2/1.

Image: After a turbulent few weeks for the Labour leader, Lisa Forbes' win has earned Jeremy Corbyn some respite

Labour's new MP for Peterborough Lisa Forbes has apologised for liking antisemitic Facebook post

But I've been at many a by-election count where the mood among the party activists suddenly changes. And this was one of them.

Suddenly, the Labour activists at the Kingsgate Conference Centre became confident of victory and were predicting a win. Before long they were jubilant.

:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Mr Farage and his cronies, however, were strangely - and unusually for them - subdued and privately admitting they were going to come second.

None more so than the Brexit Party leader himself, normally ebullient, loud, raucous and brash... but not this time.

Mr Farage had spent the evening dining at the George Hotel at Stamford, one of the finest dining establishments on the A1, according to locals here.

The restaurant serves rare roast beef carved at the table and - no doubt - a fine claret to Mr Farage's liking.

But by the time he arrived at the count, the prospect of defeat was clearly too much to swallow. He evaded journalists waiting for him at the front entrance and came in by a side door.

Image: Nigel Farage had spent the evening dining at the George Hotel at Stamford

He then hid in the inappropriately named Welcome Lounge and had a narrow escape when he left to go to the gents and was almost pursued inside by journalists and camera crews.

He then left the count before the declaration without giving any interviews, leaving his defeated candidate, millionaire former Tory donor Mike Greene, to face the media.

But Mr Greene was defiant in defeat, blaming the Tory vote holding up, a lack of voting data and the Labour Party's decision to hold the by-election quickly.

For the Tories, still panicking over the Brexit Party polling 32% in the European elections, the recriminations will continue.

Mr Johnson, who this week told Tory MPs the party faces ""extinction"" and an ""existential crisis"" if the UK doesn't leave the EU on 31 October, will almost certainly romp to victory in the leadership election now.

So once again Mr Farage has spooked the Tories: first when his UKIP triumph in the 2014 European election persuaded David Cameron to hold a referendum and now frightening Tory MPs into backing Boris.

But despite coming tantalisingly close to victory in Peterborough, Mr Farage's silence was significant. He will be concerned that if his new party couldn't win here, where 61% of voters voted Leave in 2016, where can they win?

Something to chew over next time he is enjoying five-star roast beef and claret.","His Brexit Party came within just under 700 votes of pulling off a sensational by-election victory in Peterborough.

The party's spectacular 32% showing in the European elections provoked blind panic among Tory MPs and looks like propelling Boris Johnson, the only politician the Tories have who compares with Mr Farage's rock star status, to 10 Downing Street.

During polling day, bookmakers had Mr Farage's party at 1/5 and Labour 7/2, though later in the day they shortened Labour's odds to 2/1.

But I've been at many a by-election count where the mood among the party activists suddenly changes. And this was one of them.

Suddenly, the Labour activists at the Kingsgate Conference Centre became confident of victory and were predicting a win. Before long they were jubilant.

Mr Farage and his cronies, however, were strangely - and unusually for them - subdued and privately admitting they were going to come second.

None more so than the Brexit Party leader himself, normally ebullient, loud, raucous and brash... but not this time.

Mr Farage had spent the evening dining at the George Hotel at Stamford, one of the finest dining establishments on the A1, according to locals here.

The restaurant serves rare roast beef carved at the table and - no doubt - a fine claret to Mr Farage's liking.

But by the time he arrived at the count, the prospect of defeat was clearly too much to swallow. He evaded journalists waiting for him at the front entrance and came in by a side door.

He then hid in the inappropriately named Welcome Lounge and had a narrow escape when he left to go to the gents and was almost pursued inside by journalists and camera crews.

He then left the count before the declaration without giving any interviews, leaving his defeated candidate, millionaire former Tory donor Mike Greene, to face the media.

But Mr Greene was defiant in defeat, blaming the Tory vote holding up, a lack of voting data and the Labour Party's decision to hold the by-election quickly.

For the Tories, still panicking over the Brexit Party polling 32% in the European elections, the recriminations will continue.

Mr Johnson, who this week told Tory MPs the party faces ""extinction"" and an ""existential crisis"" if the UK doesn't leave the EU on 31 October, will almost certainly romp to victory in the leadership election now.

So once again Mr Farage has spooked the Tories: first when his UKIP triumph in the 2014 European election persuaded David Cameron to hold a referendum and now frightening Tory MPs into backing Boris.

But despite coming tantalisingly close to victory in Peterborough, Mr Farage's silence was significant. He will be concerned that if his new party couldn't win here, where 61% of voters voted Leave in 2016, where can they win?

Something to chew over next time he is enjoying five-star roast beef and claret.","His Brexit Party came within just under 700 votes of pulling off a sensational by-election victory in Peterborough.

48,Sally Challen: Husband 'controlled the world around her',Charlotte Lomas,"Sally Challen bludgeoned her husband to death with a hammer after decades of coercive control - a form of domestic abuse that strips victims of their liberty and freedom.

Sky News has spoken to her son David, who has defended her throughout:

As Richard bent forward to eat the breakfast made by his wife, she grabbed a nearby hammer and hit him 20 times.

Sally then stuffed a tea towel in his mouth and wrapped him in old curtains.

Before turning to do the dishes, she wrote a note - 'I love you, Sally' - and placed it on the body.

She had just ended 31 years of marriage by violently attacking her husband in the kitchen of their £1m Surrey home.

Her son David testified that the three decades his parents were together were not a marriage for his mother - it had been a mental prison.

He said Sally had always been trapped - and husband Richard held the keys.

""You just felt an undercurrent of abuse happening but you couldn't see the abuse or the moments of it. It was a drip, drip, drip… and that's what my mother suffered behind closed doors,"" David explained, detailing the decades of coercive control his mother endured.

'My mum killed my dad after years of abuse'

Sally, then 56, killed her 61-year-old husband on an August morning in 2010. Ten months later, she stood at the end of a seven-day trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder.

Eight years on, her case was to be appealed, taking into consideration the impact of Richard's controlling behaviour.

Coercive control became a criminal offence in 2015, which was too late for her first trial, but the family hoped the criminalisation would help his mother this time round.

They sought to change her charge from murder to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility - and they won.

Speaking to Sky News earlier this year, David recalled having a nice, normal childhood.

Image: David Challen campaigned for greater awareness of coercive control

Until the age of five, he said, he felt very loved but as he got closer to his teens that love began to ""slip away"" from his father.

""I could see his mind was elsewhere. There was something inherently bad I felt about him even at a young age.

""It was such a strange feeling to have, like morally in my gut I felt that he was corrupt in some sort of way.

""I couldn't put my finger on it but it's bizarre because when I reached my mid-to-late teens it started to become more open.

""When I heard he was cheating it was like we'd been waiting for that moment. It wasn't a surprise.""

Sally worked to hide the troubles from her young children and focused on keeping the house running and supporting her husband's business.

When David reached his teens he noticed his mum tracked his father, keeping a note of his phone records, where he was going, who he was meeting.

It became clear Richard was relentlessly - and unabashedly - cheating.

He had multiple phones, used dating sites and was caught by Sally visiting a brothel.

Image: 1 Ruxley Ridge was Sally Challen's former marital home

David recalled: ""The arguments started to get more vocal… and more and more abusive.

""He had a mantra… he would say, 'You're going mad, Sally. You're making it all up. You're going mad.'""

Sally eventually confided in her son, telling him that at times she did question herself. Was it all really in her head? Was she going mad?

This behaviour is a textbook example of gaslighting.

Relate, the relationship support charity, says gaslighting is trying to convince someone they're wrong even when they aren't.

They explained that it is dangerous ""because it undermines a person's sense of self-belief"" and is used by abusers to train their partner not to challenge them and to feel less confident.

Richard would tell Sally what she could eat, wear, where she could go, that she was going mad, that she was getting fat - calling his petite wife ""thunder thighs"".

Image: Sally Challen was married to her husband for more than three decades

The abuse was not solely psychological - Sally told her lawyer of Richard dragging her down the stairs and of rape.

David knew this behaviour was wrong and that this was what relationships were like. Yet, he didn't know how to verbalise what his father was doing to his mother.

""What can I use as the tangible term? There was no law against psychological abuse at that time. It only came in in 2015. It's still not understood now,"" he said.

David argued and argued and argued with his father. He brought up that this behaviour was wrong countless times but Richard was ""like Teflon"".

""You just couldn't land a punch. It was the most frustrating thing. We all tried to stop him but there was no power in the law to do anything about him.

""Everyone that's had an argument with him [knows] it's impossible. And for a woman that's been with him for 40-plus years*, to have been up against that.. I mean, I would have lost the plot,"" David said.

Many people reading this will wonder why Sally didn't leave. It is a question asked of many women and men who are victim of domestic abuse.

Sally did try to leave. She tried many, many times - to the point her lawyer commented no previous client of theirs had stopped and started divorce proceedings so often.

She had managed to use her inheritance to buy a new home and to move David in with her, while her other son left to move in with his girlfriend.

You just felt an undercurrent of abuse happening but you couldn't see the abuse or the moments of it. It was a drip, drip, drip… and that's what my mother suffered behind closed doors

But Richard seeped back into Sally's life. She asked him to take her back.

The morning Sally killed Richard she had returned to their marital home in Claygate to spend time with Richard in a joint attempt to reconcile their marriage.

He asked her to get food for breakfast from the shops. She felt suspicious - was Richard trying to get her out the house deliberately?

She returned and checked his phone. He'd made a call to a woman Sally knew Richard had met on a dating site.

He refused to explain, finally reprimanding her: ""Don't question me.""

Sally maintains she doesn't remember what happened next.

""We don't justify it,"" David said of his mother's actions.

He added: ""She is serving time for a crime. She will serve time for that crime.

""But that crime needs to be judged properly. She's not vengeful, she's not jealous, she was psychologically manipulated and that is what coercive control is.""

Image: David Challen as a youngster with mother Sally

When Sally asked to rekindle their marriage, Richard had responded by demanding a post-nuptial agreement, stripping Sally of most of the financial assets she was due and humiliating her by demanding in writing that she would never interrupt him and to ban her from smoking.

Sally, so dependent on Richard, came close to signing this document.

""She didn't know how to survive in a world without him,"" David said.

""He was her oxygen and he made it that way. He controlled the world around her at a young age.""

Richard met Sally when he was 22 and she was 15. Sally's father had died when she was five.

""My father was that male authority [figure for her]. He designed the world around what he thought it should be for her and that was him,"" David said.

Two weeks before his mother killed Richard, David began to feel that something was amiss and started to worry about Sally's movements.

When he would tell his mum she shouldn't be with Richard, Sally would shut him off.

The day David, then 23, found out what happened, his mother dropped him off at work in the morning.

""You know I love you, don't you David?"" his mum said, looking him in the eyes as he stepped out the car.

""I love you too,"" he replied. Something was odd - but he turned and went to work.

Hours later, he was told his father had been murdered.

""I look in the mirror and I see his face. I still love my father and I love my mother,"" he said.

David did not reflexively jump to his mum's aid.

""[I] looked long and hard at what happened. I identified my dad's body. I've taken in everything that she's done - and I have to acknowledge that he's helped abused her from the age of 15 to 56. He's contorted and twisted her mind. Gaslighted her. Made her question her reality multiple times.""

David said he'd love to be able to say his mum was doing fine, but when he was speaking to Sky News, she was in prison.

""It's the sadness of a person that is so loving and caring and meek and mild, who's tried to live her life in the best way and be a supportive wife.

""She's been endlessly abused for such a long period of time.""

His mother went on a programme during her first year on remand and learnt about control and power.

She came out ""wide-eyed"", realising that had been her life for three decades, David said.

Regardless, David said his mother was still in love with Richard.

Image: Sally Challen was 56 when she killed her husband

""She still loves him and that sounds bizarre but that's coercive control. She was designed to love one man from the age of 15 to 56. It's deep.""

The day after killing Richard, Sally travelled to Beachy Head intending to kill herself.

She stopped, she said, because she could not leave David and his brother behind.","It was a drip, drip, drip… and that's what my mother suffered behind closed doors,"" David explained, detailing the decades of coercive control his mother endured.

""She still loves him and that sounds bizarre but that's coercive control. She was designed to love one man from the age of 15 to 56. It's deep.""

The day after killing Richard, Sally travelled to Beachy Head intending to kill herself.

She stopped, she said, because she could not leave David and his brother behind.","It was a drip, drip, drip… and that's what my mother suffered behind closed doors,"" David explained, detailing the decades of coercive control his mother endured.

51,Sally Challen: Husband 'controlled the world around her',News Reporter,"Sally Challen bludgeoned her husband to death with a hammer after decades of coercive control - a form of domestic abuse that strips victims of their liberty and freedom.

Sky News has spoken to her son David, who has defended her throughout:

As Richard bent forward to eat the breakfast made by his wife, she grabbed a nearby hammer and hit him 20 times.

Sally then stuffed a tea towel in his mouth and wrapped him in old curtains.

Before turning to do the dishes, she wrote a note - 'I love you, Sally' - and placed it on the body.

She had just ended 31 years of marriage by violently attacking her husband in the kitchen of their £1m Surrey home.

Her son David testified that the three decades his parents were together were not a marriage for his mother - it had been a mental prison.

He said Sally had always been trapped - and husband Richard held the keys.

""You just felt an undercurrent of abuse happening but you couldn't see the abuse or the moments of it. It was a drip, drip, drip… and that's what my mother suffered behind closed doors,"" David explained, detailing the decades of coercive control his mother endured.

'My mum killed my dad after years of abuse'

Sally, then 56, killed her 61-year-old husband on an August morning in 2010. Ten months later, she stood at the end of a seven-day trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder.

Eight years on, her case was to be appealed, taking into consideration the impact of Richard's controlling behaviour.

Coercive control became a criminal offence in 2015, which was too late for her first trial, but the family hoped the criminalisation would help his mother this time round.

They sought to change her charge from murder to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility - and they won.

Speaking to Sky News earlier this year, David recalled having a nice, normal childhood.

Image: David Challen campaigned for greater awareness of coercive control

Until the age of five, he said, he felt very loved but as he got closer to his teens that love began to ""slip away"" from his father.

""I could see his mind was elsewhere. There was something inherently bad I felt about him even at a young age.

""It was such a strange feeling to have, like morally in my gut I felt that he was corrupt in some sort of way.

""I couldn't put my finger on it but it's bizarre because when I reached my mid-to-late teens it started to become more open.

""When I heard he was cheating it was like we'd been waiting for that moment. It wasn't a surprise.""

Sally worked to hide the troubles from her young children and focused on keeping the house running and supporting her husband's business.

When David reached his teens he noticed his mum tracked his father, keeping a note of his phone records, where he was going, who he was meeting.

It became clear Richard was relentlessly - and unabashedly - cheating.

He had multiple phones, used dating sites and was caught by Sally visiting a brothel.

David recalled: ""The arguments started to get more vocal… and more and more abusive.

""He had a mantra… he would say, 'You're going mad, Sally. You're making it all up. You're going mad.'""

Sally eventually confided in her son, telling him that at times she did question herself. Was it all really in her head? Was she going mad?

This behaviour is a textbook example of gaslighting.

Relate, the relationship support charity, says gaslighting is trying to convince someone they're wrong even when they aren't.

They explained that it is dangerous ""because it undermines a person's sense of self-belief"" and is used by abusers to train their partner not to challenge them and to feel less confident.

Richard would tell Sally what she could eat, wear, where she could go, that she was going mad, that she was getting fat - calling his petite wife ""thunder thighs"".

Image: Sally Challen was married to her husband for more than three decades

The abuse was not solely psychological - Sally told her lawyer of Richard dragging her down the stairs and of rape.

David knew this behaviour was wrong and that this was what relationships were like. Yet, he didn't know how to verbalise what his father was doing to his mother.

""What can I use as the tangible term? There was no law against psychological abuse at that time. It only came in in 2015. It's still not understood now,"" he said.

David argued and argued and argued with his father. He brought up that this behaviour was wrong countless times but Richard was ""like Teflon"".

""You just couldn't land a punch. It was the most frustrating thing. We all tried to stop him but there was no power in the law to do anything about him.

""Everyone that's had an argument with him [knows] it's impossible. And for a woman that's been with him for 40-plus years*, to have been up against that.. I mean, I would have lost the plot,"" David said.

Many people reading this will wonder why Sally didn't leave. It is a question asked of many women and men who are victim of domestic abuse.

Sally did try to leave. She tried many, many times - to the point her lawyer commented no previous client of theirs had stopped and started divorce proceedings so often.

She had managed to use her inheritance to buy a new home and to move David in with her, while her other son left to move in with his girlfriend.

You just felt an undercurrent of abuse happening but you couldn't see the abuse or the moments of it. It was a drip, drip, drip… and that's what my mother suffered behind closed doors

But Richard seeped back into Sally's life. She asked him to take her back.

The morning Sally killed Richard she had returned to their marital home in Claygate to spend time with Richard in a joint attempt to reconcile their marriage.

He asked her to get food for breakfast from the shops. She felt suspicious - was Richard trying to get her out the house deliberately?

She returned and checked his phone. He'd made a call to a woman Sally knew Richard had met on a dating site.

He refused to explain, finally reprimanding her: ""Don't question me.""

Sally maintains she doesn't remember what happened next.

""We don't justify it,"" David said of his mother's actions.

He added: ""She is serving time for a crime. She will serve time for that crime.

""But that crime needs to be judged properly. She's not vengeful, she's not jealous, she was psychologically manipulated and that is what coercive control is.""

Image: David Challen as a youngster with mother Sally

When Sally asked to rekindle their marriage, Richard had responded by demanding a post-nuptial agreement, stripping Sally of most of the financial assets she was due and humiliating her by demanding in writing that she would never interrupt him and to ban her from smoking.

Sally, so dependent on Richard, came close to signing this document.

""She didn't know how to survive in a world without him,"" David said.

""He was her oxygen and he made it that way. He controlled the world around her at a young age.""

Richard met Sally when he was 22 and she was 15. Sally's father had died when she was five.

""My father was that male authority [figure for her]. He designed the world around what he thought it should be for her and that was him,"" David said.

Two weeks before his mother killed Richard, David began to feel that something was amiss and started to worry about Sally's movements.

When he would tell his mum she shouldn't be with Richard, Sally would shut him off.

The day David, then 23, found out what happened, his mother dropped him off at work in the morning.

""You know I love you, don't you David?"" his mum said, looking him in the eyes as he stepped out the car.

""I love you too,"" he replied. Something was odd - but he turned and went to work.

Hours later, he was told his father had been murdered.

""I look in the mirror and I see his face. I still love my father and I love my mother,"" he said.

David did not reflexively jump to his mum's aid.

""[I] looked long and hard at what happened. I identified my dad's body. I've taken in everything that she's done - and I have to acknowledge that he's helped abused her from the age of 15 to 56. He's contorted and twisted her mind. Gaslighted her. Made her question her reality multiple times.""

David said he'd love to be able to say his mum was doing fine, but when he was speaking to Sky News, she was in prison.

""It's the sadness of a person that is so loving and caring and meek and mild, who's tried to live her life in the best way and be a supportive wife.

""She's been endlessly abused for such a long period of time.""

His mother went on a programme during her first year on remand and learnt about control and power.

She came out ""wide-eyed"", realising that had been her life for three decades, David said.

Regardless, David said his mother was still in love with Richard.

54,Sky Views: Investors beware of tech firms racing to market,Ian King,"Ian King, business presenter

These are busy times on Wall Street.

Lyft, the ride-hailing app, floated on the stock market at the end of March with a valuation of $24bn (£18.4bn).

Coming hard on its heels is its rival, Uber, which is currently on an investor roadshow ahead of its initial public offering (IPO).

This is expected to value it at up to $91bn (£69.8bn).

Pinterest, the social media company, has just floated with a valuation of nearly $13bn (£9.9bn).

The mobile messaging app Slack is also coming to market although, like Spotify last year, it is doing so via a so-called ""direct listing"" and so will not enrich Wall Street quite as much as it would have had it pursued a traditional IPO. It is likely to attract a price tag of at least $13bn (£9.9bn).

This quartet are not ""unicorns"", private companies with a valuation of more than $1bn (£767m), but ""decacorns"" - private companies with a valuation of more than $10bn (£7.6bn).

They, along with many unicorns, are racing to come to market in what looks like being the biggest year for tech IPOs since 1999.

Image: Ride-hailing app Lyft floated on the stock market with a valuation of $24bn (£18.4bn)

That should chill investors to the marrow. 1999 more or less marked the zenith of the dot-com bubble as 486 companies came to market, a record yet to be surpassed, more than half of which were tech firms.

Around $100bn (£76.7bn) was raised from investors and fortunes were made by the entrepreneurs who founded the companies and the venture capital firms who backed them in their early days. It didn't last. The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by tech stocks, peaked at 5,048.62 on 10 March 2000 and then collapsed. It then went on to lose 78% of its value before hitting a nadir in October 2002 and did not recapture its bubble-era peak until January 2017.

It is instructive to recall some of the best-performing tech IPOs of that year. Internet Capital Group, a venture capital firm specialising in tech investments, saw its shares rocket by 2,733% between its IPO in August 1999 and the end of the year.

Its shares lost 99.5% of their value after peaking in March 2000 and, although it survived the bursting of the dot-com bubble, it has subsequently been liquidated.

Image: Uber has just revealed an operating loss last year of $3bn (£2.3bn)

Then there was CommerceOne, a loss-making e-commerce platform, which rose by 2,707% between its flotation in June that year and the end of 1999. At its peak, it was valued at $21.5bn (£16.5bn), but, by 2004, it was bankrupt.

Others included VerticalNet, whose shares rose by 1,950% between its flotation in February 1999 and the end of that year. It was, bewilderingly, valued at $1.6bn (£1.2bn) at its IPO despite having quarterly sales of less than $4m (£3m) and went on to be valued at just shy of $11bn (£8.4bn) when the Nasdaq peaked. It was worth a mere $15m (£11.5m) when finally put out of its misery in 2008.

Not all of the big-name tech IPOs of 1999 were complete duds. Ariba, a software business, saw its shares rise by 1,442% after its IPO in June 1999 and went on to reach a peak valuation of $40bn (£30.7bn). It was bought for a tenth of that in 2012 by SAP, the German software group, but at least it lives on.

So too does one of the best-known of the bunch, the software company Red Hat, whose shares rocketed by 1,409% after its IPO in August that year. Its shares then spent years in the doldrums but eventually recaptured their bubble-era valuation early in 2018, prior to news last October that it had agreed a $34bn (£26bn) takeover by IBM.

Image: Pinterest, the social media company, has floated with a valuation of nearly $13bn (£9.9bn)

But Red Hat and Ariba are the exceptions. Most of the buzziest tech stocks that came to market in 1999, the likes of Purchasepro.com, Redback Networks and eToys.com, are no longer with us. It is impossible not to recall, without giggling, the way in which some of them lured in credulous investors.

One classic example is Drkoop.com, a health information portal founded by America's former surgeon general, Dr C. Everett Koop. It raised $89m (£68m) from investors at the time of its IPO in June 1999 and swiftly achieved a market valuation of more than $1bn (£767.6m) despite being loss-making throughout its entire existence.

But things soured when it transpired that much of what was purported to be medical information on the website was actually paid-for advertising. It went bankrupt less than three years after coming to market although, happily, Dr Koop himself lived on to the ripe old age of 96 before passing away in 2013.

The other chilling comparison with 1999 is how few of these tech companies racing to come to market are profitable. To take the quartet mentioned above, Lyft made a loss of $911m (£699m) during 2018, while Slack Technologies has just published figures revealing it lost just short of $141m (£108m) last year.

Pinterest, meanwhile, lost $63m (£48m). As for Uber, it has just revealed an operating loss last year of $3bn (£2.3bn), while its 431-page door-stopper of a prospectus contained this absolutely astonishing warning to potential investors: ""We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future and we may not achieve profitability.""

Some will argue this does not matter. Apple, the world's most valuable company, has been loss-making at various points in its history. Amazon, the world's third most valuable company, has been loss-making for much of its existence.

Image: Ariba was bought by SAP, the German software group

What matters, say supporters of these companies, is their potential to enjoy super-charged profits in future as they achieve dominance of their sector. Uber, for example, is expected to dominate ride-hailing and other forms of transportation much as Amazon now dominates online retail (even though the most profitable part of Amazon by far is not its retail division but its web services division).

What looks like an outlandish valuation at flotation, supporters of these companies argue, can ultimately look quite reasonable. Facebook, for example, was valued at $104bn (£79.8bn) at its IPO in May 2012 despite making net profits the previous year of just $1bn (£767m). Its stock market valuation last night was $551bn (£422.9bn) and anyone who bought at the IPO has profited handsomely.

Stock markets are not partying like it's 1999 in all respects. The S&P 500 - America's broadest and most important stock index - has been regularly hitting record highs during recent weeks and looks priced to perfection, in the jargon, but is trading on a lower valuation (expressed as a multiple of share price divided by earnings per share) than it was in 1999.

Nor is the euphoria quite as insane as in 1999. Uber has already had to cut its projected value at flotation from the originally-mooted $120bn (£92.1bn) while shares of Lyft are now some 20% lower than they were when it made its stock market debut. The loopy day-one ""pops"" seen in 1999 - shares of CommerceOne, for example, were floated at $21 (£16) each and immediately shot up to $66 (£55) on debut - have not been seen this time around.

Image: Facebook was valued at $104bn (£79.8bn) at its IPO in May 2012

Other differences from 1999 include the fact that many of the companies coming to market have been around for longer than their equivalents 20 years ago and have an established revenue base. Uber, for example, is a decade old and, while loss-making in 2018, still enjoyed revenues of $11.3bn (£8.6bn), up 43% on 2017.

By contrast in 1999, at times, it felt as if any chancer with a half-baked idea, a company name ending in "".com"" or "".net"" and a fancy logo could float their six-month-old company on the stock market.

And yet, in many other respects, what is happening now feels eerily familiar: the massive valuations, the eye-watering losses, the competition between Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to get the newcomers to list on their exchange.

In the months before Nasdaq peaked, there was a sense that many companies were rushing to come to market while the good times were still rolling, another parallel with today. There is no obvious reason why these companies are rushing to float, right now, apart from a fear of missing out.

The very reason many of these unicorns and decacorns are older and better-established than their 1999 equivalents is because the venture capital sector has been (and remains) awash with cash. These companies have not previously had any need to float because they had no need to tap the public markets for capital.

The very reason many of these unicorns and decacorns are older and better-established than their 1999 equivalents is because the venture capital sector has been and remains awash with cash.

Accordingly, now they are coming to market, investors are having to pay handsomely for the privilege of owning the shares.

The motivation of many investors to pay these vast sums is even more baffling than the rush to come to market. Again, it appears to be the fear of missing out. No one wants to miss out on the next Facebook or Amazon.

But not all of these tech companies currently coming to market with fancy valuations will be the next Amazon or Facebook. Many will turn out to be the next eToys.com or Drkoop.com.

What looks like an outlandish valuation at flotation, supporters of these companies argue, can ultimately look quite reasonable. Facebook, for example, was valued at $104bn (£79.8bn) at its IPO in May 2012 despite making net profits the previous year of just $1bn (£767m). Its stock market valuation last night was $551bn (£422.9bn) and anyone who bought at the IPO has profited handsomely.

Stock markets are not partying like it's 1999 in all respects. The S&P 500 - America's broadest and most important stock index - has been regularly hitting record highs during recent weeks and looks priced to perfection, in the jargon, but is trading on a lower valuation (expressed as a multiple of share price divided by earnings per share) than it was in 1999.

Nor is the euphoria quite as insane as in 1999. Uber has already had to cut its projected value at flotation from the originally-mooted $120bn (£92.1bn) while shares of Lyft are now some 20% lower than they were when it made its stock market debut. The loopy day-one ""pops"" seen in 1999 - shares of CommerceOne, for example, were floated at $21 (£16) each and immediately shot up to $66 (£55) on debut - have not been seen this time around.

Image: Facebook was valued at $104bn (£79.8bn) at its IPO in May 2012

Other differences from 1999 include the fact that many of the companies coming to market have been around for longer than their equivalents 20 years ago and have an established revenue base. Uber, for example, is a decade old and, while loss-making in 2018, still enjoyed revenues of $11.3bn (£8.6bn), up 43% on 2017.

By contrast in 1999, at times, it felt as if any chancer with a half-baked idea, a company name ending in "".com"" or "".net"" and a fancy logo could float their six-month-old company on the stock market.

And yet, in many other respects, what is happening now feels eerily familiar: the massive valuations, the eye-watering losses, the competition between Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to get the newcomers to list on their exchange.

In the months before Nasdaq peaked, there was a sense that many companies were rushing to come to market while the good times were still rolling, another parallel with today. There is no obvious reason why these companies are rushing to float, right now, apart from a fear of missing out.

The very reason many of these unicorns and decacorns are older and better-established than their 1999 equivalents is because the venture capital sector has been (and remains) awash with cash. These companies have not previously had any need to float because they had no need to tap the public markets for capital.

The very reason many of these unicorns and decacorns are older and better-established than their 1999 equivalents is because the venture capital sector has been and remains awash with cash.

Accordingly, now they are coming to market, investors are having to pay handsomely for the privilege of owning the shares.

The motivation of many investors to pay these vast sums is even more baffling than the rush to come to market. Again, it appears to be the fear of missing out. No one wants to miss out on the next Facebook or Amazon.

But not all of these tech companies currently coming to market with fancy valuations will be the next Amazon or Facebook. Many will turn out to be the next eToys.com or Drkoop.com.

56,Radical shake-up of overdraft charges will restrict fees,Sharon Marris,"Fixed fees for overdrafts will be banned under reforms announced by the financial regulator.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has described its new rules as the ""biggest overhaul of the market in a generation"".

Fixed fees for borrowing through an overdraft will be banned and banks and building societies will have to price overdrafts by a simple annual interest rate.

Banks and building societies will no longer be able to charge more for unarranged overdrafts than they do for arranged overdrafts.

They will also have to do more to identify customers who are showing signs of financial strain and be prepared to help reduce repeated overdraft use.

In 2017, firms made more than £2.4bn from overdrafts, with around 30% from unarranged overdrafts.

'Biggest overhaul for a generation' - FCA'S Christopher Woolard

More than half of banks' unarranged overdraft fees came from just 1.5% of customers in 2016, many of them vulnerable and living in deprived areas.

Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition, said the new rules are the ""biggest overhaul of the overdrafts market we've seen in a generation"".

He told Sky News: ""This is a dysfunctional market at the moment and we want to make it easier and clearer and fairer for people to use overdrafts.""

He said that current charges for borrowing £100 through an unarranged overdraft could be around £5 a day but ""in future we think it should cost around 20p"".

Fees for unarranged overdrafts can be more than 10 times as high as fees for payday loans, the FCA has said.

But Mr Woolard ruled out the possibility of compensation for those who have been paying such overdraft fees for years.

He said: ""[The new rules are] a forward-looking measure, there is no suggestion in any of the work that we've done that banks or others had broken the rules that existed at the time.""

Some of the changes will come into effect immediately, such as the guidance on refused payment fees.

Others will take ""a little bit of time"", Mr Woolard said, adding that the full range of measures should be in place by April next year.

""There are changes banks will need to make with their systems and how they interact with their customers, so this is going to take time to get it right.""

Citizens Advice supported 24,000 people struggling to repay overdrafts last year - two in five of them had a disability or long-term health condition and one in four were single parents, it said.

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the rules should help prevent customers ""getting trapped in a debt spiral"" while MoneySuperMarket's Emma Craig said the FCA's intervention was ""long overdue"".

Eric Leenders, managing director - personal finance at trade association UK Finance, said it would be ""working closely with the FCA"" to implement the rules.

""The industry is working on a voluntary agreement to make the cost of overdraft borrowing easier to understand for consumers which is due to be implemented in April 2020. This will build on the range of measures already introduced by the industry, such as text alerts which have been shown to reduce overdraft charges by 25%.

""Overdrafts can provide a convenient way for customers to smooth their short-term cashflow, and there is a highly competitive market in the UK with over 96 products on offer.

""We would always urge customers to speak to their bank and arrange an overdraft in advance to ensure payments are honoured.""","Banks and building societies will no longer be able to charge more for unarranged overdrafts than they do for arranged overdrafts.

58,MPs to unveil steel inquiry with industry teetering on brink,Mark Kleinman,"The Commons BEIS committee is set to announce the launch of the inquiry this weekend

The business secretary‎ and the former owners of British Steel are to be called to give evidence to a parliamentary inquiry with the future of the UK's second-largest producer continuing to hang in the balance.

Sky News understands that ‎the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee will announce this weekend the launch of an inquiry into Britain's ailing steel sector.

Sources said the committee, chaired by the Labour MP‎ Rachel Reeves, would want to explore the role of Greybull Capital, the owner of British Steel between 2016 and its collapse last month - a development which put as many as 25,000 jobs at risk.

The company, which operates from a vast steelworks in Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire and a number of other sites, is now under the control of the Official Receiver (OR).

‎Prospective bidders have been given until the end of this month to notify the government of their interest in buying part or all of British Steel.

Sources close to the process have cast doubt on the likelihood of credible offers emerging for the entire company.

One potential buyer criticised ‎a statement issued by the OR which referred to dozens of non-disclosure agreements having been signed as ""raising false hopes about the chances of a saviour emerging"".

Many parties, including Greybull, are interested in some divisions of British Steel rather than the whole business.

Sky News revealed last month that the company was heading towards collapse amid fractious talks with ministers about an emergency support package.

Greg Clark, the business secretary, decided in April to hand over a £120m bridging loan to fund the cost of carbon credits from which British Steel had been excluded because of uncertainty over Brexit.

However, despite expectations that a further loan would be forthcoming, BEIS got cold feet, citing state aid concerns, leading to the appointment of liquidators.

Mr Clark told the Commons on the day of British Steel's collapse that he would welcome an inquiry by Ms Reeves' committee.

One insider said it was ""certain"" that Mr Clark would be asked to give oral evidence, and would be asked about the details of negotiations with Greybull and British Steel's lenders.

In total, British Steel employs more than 4000 people, with roughly 20,000 more said to be dependent on it through its supply chain.

MPs are also likely to examine the impact of a no-deal Brexit‎ on the steel industry, with uncertainty also continuing to plague the future of the UK's largest plant: Tata Steel's site at Port Talbot in Wales.

Ms Reeves and her‎ colleagues on the BEIS committee raised concerns even before the collapse of British Steel into insolvency about the lack of government support for the industry.

A failure to unveil a sector deal as part of the industrial strategy‎ was a reflection of the extent to which ministers had neglected an important component of the UK's manufacturing capability, Ms Reeves said several months ago.

60,"CMC tycoon Cruddas hands £50,000 to Johnson leadership bid",Mark Kleinman,"Boris Johnson has been handed £50,000 by Peter Cruddas, one of the City's leading figures, as he seeks to blow rivals away financially and rebuild his standing among employers in the race for the Conservative Party leadership.

Sky News has learnt that Mr Cruddas, the founder and chief executive of financial spread-betting firm CMC Markets, wrote the five-figure cheque to Mr Johnson's campaign earlier this week.

The donation swells Mr Johnson's coffers days after he held a private breakfast with wealthy potential backers at a private members' club in London's Mayfair.

Sources say the former foreign secretary used the event to seek to rebuild his credentials as a pro-business candidate, even as the furore about comments he made about the private sector's antipathy to a no-deal Brexit continues to reverberate through the Tory leadership contest.

Mr Johnson is understood to have outlined an ambition to cut stamp duty and oversee steeper-than-planned cuts to corporation tax if he becomes prime minister, according to insiders.

The race to build campaign warchests has already seen the dozen candidates collectively raise hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Under the rules of the contest, candidates can spend a maximum of £150,000 between today and the date of the new leader's election - as revealed by Sky News earlier this week.

Image: Boris Johnson is favourite to replace Theresa May

Any surplus funds raised by individual candidates will be returned to party coffers, providing Tory finances with a welcome boost at a time when disputes over Theresa May's handling of Brexit have caused a sharp fall in donations.

Sources said that Mr Johnson had been discussing raising a total of as much as £500,000 to fund his campaign - some of which will already have been spent ahead of the opening on Friday of the spending window.

The first round of voting will take place next Thursday.

Insiders said other big donors to Mr Johnson's campaign included the JCB owner Lord Bamford, who is said to have pledged a six-figure sum, and Jamie Reuben, an entrepreneur who is a significant investor in property assets and technology companies.

The £50,000 given by Mr Cruddas, who has also served as Tory treasurer and been a substantial donor to the party, reflects his belief that Mrs May's successor needs to be someone committed to implementing the result of the 2016 EU referendum.

I'm going to give him some money and back him,"" the CMC founder told Bloomberg News on Thursday.

""I think we need a Brexiteer as our next prime minister.

""The country voted to leave the European Union and I think we should have someone that delivered that, and it should be someone like Boris Johnson.""

One of the City's most successful self-made businessmen, Mr Cruddas served as Tory treasurer until 2012, when his term was brought to an abrupt end by a newspaper story for which he successfully sued for libel.

Mr Cruddas declined to comment on the size of his donation to Mr Johnson on Friday, while a spokesman for Mr Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

62,Oklahoma vs Johnson & Johnson: A high-stakes opioid battle,Ian King,"If the precedent is set, it could open the industry up to a host of legal challenges

It's no secret that the United States has a painkillers crisis.

More than 400,000 Americans are estimated to have died during the last two decades due to their addiction to opioids.

However, when the history of this crisis is written up, today may prove a crucial date. Because today marks the start of a court case that could set a precedent on whether states can sue pharmaceuticals companies and hold them accountable for the crisis.

If the precedent is set, it could open the industry up to a host of legal challenges, potentially seeing Big Pharma dragged through the US courts just as Big Tobacco was from the mid-1950s until it reached a $206bn ""master"" settlement in November 1998.

Today's case sees Johnson & Johnson, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare company, pitted against the state of Oklahoma.

Image: Attorney-general Mike Hunter says the crisis is 'devastating Oklahoma'

Mike Hunter, Oklahoma's attorney-general, argues that J&J's marketing deceptively played down the risk of patients becoming addicted to painkillers and also alleges that the company, along with others, pressured doctors to prescribe the drugs.

He says that the consequences of the ""public nuisance"" created by this marketing campaign could cost Oklahoma up to $17.5bn (£13.8bn) to tackle with programmes addressing drug addiction and abuse.

Opening his case, Mr Hunter told the state court in Norman, Oklahoma: ""This is the worst man-made public health crisis in our state's history. To put it bluntly, this crisis is devastating Oklahoma.""

There are at least four fascinating aspects to the case.

The first is that J&J is fighting it alone. When Mr Hunter launched proceedings, it was against three companies, one of which was J&J. But Oklahoma has now settled out of court with the other two.

Purdue Pharma, maker of what is arguably America's best-known painkiller, OxyContin, settled the claims in March this year with a payment of $270m (£213m) while a second drug maker that was due to face trial, Teva Pharmaceuticals of Israel, reached an $85m (£67m) settlement at the weekend without admitting any wrongdoing. That leaves J&J, whose opioid products trade under brand names such as Nucynta and Duragesic, on its own in the dock.

Image: More than 400,000 Americans are estimated to have died during the last two decades due to opioid addiction

The second aspect is that Oklahoma is using a law - public nuisance - that is usually deployed in cases concerning offences such as illegal dumping and noise pollution. It is something of a risk for the state because a judge in North Dakota recently threw out a case brought by that state against Purdue on the grounds that the law had not been extended to the sale of goods.

However, in an earlier attempt to get the Oklahoma case thrown out on similar grounds, J&J failed. Mr Hunter, who launched proceedings just under two years ago, has finessed the arguments against J&J down to one single accusation.

J&J's main defence is likely to centre on the suggestion that the three companies marketed what were perfectly legal products, regulated by the US Food & Drink Administration (FDA), but cannot be held responsible for deaths caused by illegal abuse of the drugs.

Evidence will be supplied from more than 200 people and is expected to include harrowing accounts of the suffering of addicts from former addicts themselves, their families and their doctors.

The third interesting aspect to the case, which is expected to last for two months, is that it is likely to carry echoes of the cases fought against Big Tobacco. Evidence will be supplied from more than 200 people and is expected to include harrowing accounts of the suffering of addicts from former addicts themselves, their families and their doctors. The state's legal team includes a lawyer whose niece died as a result of an opioid overdose.

Should Oklahoma win, a further 2,000 cases are said to be in the offing, brought by other cities, US states, Native American tribes and others anxious to recoup some of the cost of dealing with the addiction epidemic.

Oklahoma is a good test case because it is fairly typical of states that have an opioid crisis.

According to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, there were 10.2 deaths for every 100,000 Oklahoma residents in 2017, slightly lower than the national rate of 14.2. However, its level of prescriptions is higher than the US average, with 88.1 prescriptions for every 100 people in 2017. And that is falling: in some previous years, according to Oklahoma's legal filings, there have been more prescriptions written for painkillers than there are Oklahoma residents.

The fourth fascinating feature of the trial is Mr Hunter himself. He has previously described himself as a Reaganite Republican who is sympathetic to big business but, earlier this month, told a think-tank: ""Sometimes businesses do bad things - and this is one of those instances.""

Apart from the other potential litigants, Wall Street will also be watching proceedings closely, for fear of what fate might befall other drug companies.

However, while industry observers believe a settlement of the kind reached by Big Tobacco with its adversaries in 1998 is possible, most believe this is unlikely to be on the same scale.

As Fitch Ratings told clients in August last year: ""We believe the potential for a tobacco-style master settlement agreement (MSA) exists, due to a large number of outstanding lawsuits, but do not view liabilities as akin to the $200billion+ tobacco MSA as likely, given opioids are FDA approved prescription medications for severe pain and sales of opioids are a small fraction of the sales of tobacco products.""

One thing is certain, though: this is not the only legal headache being faced by J&J. In December last year J&J shares suffered their biggest one-day fall in 16 years, knocking $40bn (£31.6bn) from the company's stock market value. This came after Reuters news agency reported that the company had known since 1971 that its world-famous baby powder - the company's flagship product - contained trace elements of asbestos.

A number of legal cases have already been heard and, in its biggest setback so far, J&J was last week ordered by a New York jury to pay $25m (£19.7m) in compensation to a woman who claimed she had developed mesothelioma due to being exposed to the powder.

The Oklahoma case should help wider understanding of what one of America's biggest companies did or did not know about the addictive qualities of the drugs it was manufacturing.

63,Oklahoma vs Johnson & Johnson: A high-stakes opioid battle,Sky News Business Presenter,"If the precedent is set, it could open the industry up to a host of legal challenges

It's no secret that the United States has a painkillers crisis.

More than 400,000 Americans are estimated to have died during the last two decades due to their addiction to opioids.

However, when the history of this crisis is written up, today may prove a crucial date. Because today marks the start of a court case that could set a precedent on whether states can sue pharmaceuticals companies and hold them accountable for the crisis.

If the precedent is set, it could open the industry up to a host of legal challenges, potentially seeing Big Pharma dragged through the US courts just as Big Tobacco was from the mid-1950s until it reached a $206bn ""master"" settlement in November 1998.

Today's case sees Johnson & Johnson, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare company, pitted against the state of Oklahoma.

Image: Attorney-general Mike Hunter says the crisis is 'devastating Oklahoma'

Mike Hunter, Oklahoma's attorney-general, argues that J&J's marketing deceptively played down the risk of patients becoming addicted to painkillers and also alleges that the company, along with others, pressured doctors to prescribe the drugs.

He says that the consequences of the ""public nuisance"" created by this marketing campaign could cost Oklahoma up to $17.5bn (£13.8bn) to tackle with programmes addressing drug addiction and abuse.

Opening his case, Mr Hunter told the state court in Norman, Oklahoma: ""This is the worst man-made public health crisis in our state's history. To put it bluntly, this crisis is devastating Oklahoma.""

There are at least four fascinating aspects to the case.

The first is that J&J is fighting it alone. When Mr Hunter launched proceedings, it was against three companies, one of which was J&J. But Oklahoma has now settled out of court with the other two.

Purdue Pharma, maker of what is arguably America's best-known painkiller, OxyContin, settled the claims in March this year with a payment of $270m (£213m) while a second drug maker that was due to face trial, Teva Pharmaceuticals of Israel, reached an $85m (£67m) settlement at the weekend without admitting any wrongdoing. That leaves J&J, whose opioid products trade under brand names such as Nucynta and Duragesic, on its own in the dock.

Image: More than 400,000 Americans are estimated to have died during the last two decades due to opioid addiction

The second aspect is that Oklahoma is using a law - public nuisance - that is usually deployed in cases concerning offences such as illegal dumping and noise pollution. It is something of a risk for the state because a judge in North Dakota recently threw out a case brought by that state against Purdue on the grounds that the law had not been extended to the sale of goods.

However, in an earlier attempt to get the Oklahoma case thrown out on similar grounds, J&J failed. Mr Hunter, who launched proceedings just under two years ago, has finessed the arguments against J&J down to one single accusation.

J&J's main defence is likely to centre on the suggestion that the three companies marketed what were perfectly legal products, regulated by the US Food & Drink Administration (FDA), but cannot be held responsible for deaths caused by illegal abuse of the drugs.

Evidence will be supplied from more than 200 people and is expected to include harrowing accounts of the suffering of addicts from former addicts themselves, their families and their doctors.

Bill for Brexit consultants tops £97m as government criticised for 'lack of transparency'

The NAO found that government departments did not meet the 'standards of transparency' expected

The government has been criticised for a ""lack of transparency"" and failure to grasp expenditure details related to consultancy work it bought in preparation for the UK leaving the European Union.

Following a review the spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), said departments had spent at least £97m on Brexit consultants by April 2019.

But it found expenditure figures held by the Cabinet Office failed to match up with departmental figures.

Cabinet Office figures showed £65m was spent on consultants in the year to April 2019. However, the NAO estimated the total costs from Brexit-related consultancy to be 50% higher.

The NAO investigation uncovered an additional £32m in Brexit consultancy expenditure by government departments to April this year, including costs from the EU referendum until April 2018.

The extra spending related to contracts entered into before Cabinet Office began offering support to departments requiring consultancy, and contracts with consultancy firms that departments are not able to access via Cabinet Office arrangements, the auditor said.

Auditor General Sir Amyas Morse's report set out how ""limitations in the data"" used by the Cabinet Office ""inhibit its ability to fully understand"" and there was ""little oversight"" of departments' expenditure on Brexit-related consultancy before April 2018.

The NAO criticised Whitehall for having ""not met the standards of transparency expected by government when publishing details of contracts for EU exit consultancy"".

It said government departments failed to publish details of contracts awarded within 90 calendar days.

:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

While other consultancy contracts took an average of 82 days to be published, the average for Brexit consultancy contracts was 119 days and all that had been published were ""significantly redacted"".

In April Sky News revealed that the government had quietly awarded £75m of Brexit-related contracts to some of the world's biggest consultancy firms.

Image: Labour MP Meg Hillier said it was ""not good enough"" the Cabinet Office appeared to have lost track of 50% of the consultancy costs

The news report made the contracts public for the first time, prompting the chair of the public affairs committee Meg Hillier to condemn the secrecy, and refer the contracts for investigation by the National Audit Office.

Labour MP Ms Hillier said it was ""not good enough"" that the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for improving government efficiency, appeared to have lost track of 50% of the consultancy costs.

She said: ""The lack of transparency around Brexit preparations that my committee has become all too familiar with applies to the use of these consultants.

""It is not good enough that some departments are failing to publish even basic information about their contracts and that the Cabinet Office does not know how much is being spent across government.""

The NAO also said the Cabinet Office found overall spending on consultancy services to have increased since 2015-16 from £0.5bn to £1.5bn in 2017-18.

But the figures reported in departments' annual reports for consultancy costs totalled £134m for 2015-16, compared with £332m for 2017-18.

Sir Amyas said the Cabinet Office was ""working to understand the difference between the data sets"" and would review spending, but added Brexit preparations had been a ""significant challenge"" for the government.

The Management Consultancies Association said: ""The UK is a world-leading centre for consulting and we have been proud to provide expert support to the Government with its Brexit preparations during this critical time, providing extra capacity, specialist knowledge and expertise.

""Departments have faced an unprecedented volume of workload planning for all Brexit scenarios and using external resources has enabled the government to work quickly and with intensity on major programmes across the UK.""

The NAO said six prominent consultancy firms received 96% of Brexit work from the Cabinet Office.

It named Deloitte as receiving 22%, PA Consulting 19%, PricewaterhouseCoopers 18% and Ernst & Young with 15%.

US giants Bain & Company had 11% and Boston Consulting Group took up 11% and 10% of the work respectively.

66,Tixylix and Savlon being sold to German company Stada,Sharon Marris,"Savlon is among six brands being offloaded by GSK

Tixylix and Savlon are among six brands being sold by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, it has been confirmed.

The cough medicine, antiseptic cream and four other skin creams are to be bought by private equity-backed Stada.

The deal, reported to be in the high double digit million pound range, is expected to be completed in August.

The group of brands, which also includes itch relief cream Eurax, will become part of Stada's British subsidiary Thornton & Ross, described on its website as ""the centre of excellence within the Stada group in order to promote the development of [over the counter] and dermatology business"".

Stada, a German company acquired by financial investors Bain and Cinven in 2017, is seeking to build its presence in Europe, along with selected markets in Asia and Latin America.

According to German news agency DPA, Stada had a turnover of more than €2.3bn (£2.04bn) last year.

Chief executive Peter Goldschmidt said the company's knowledge of complex European healthcare markets gives it an advantage over some other global players.

He said: ""We have a strong presence in almost all the European countries, there are not many companies where that is the case.

""For companies in, say, the United States, India or China that are looking for a European partner we are the go-to partner.""

GSK, meanwhile, is looking towards the US and China for future growth.

It is also preparing to merge its consumer healthcare unit with that of rival Pfizer, to create a new market leader with almost £10bn in annual sales.

A GSK spokesperson said: ""GSK Consumer Healthcare is divesting six non-core consumer Healthcare OTC products in 20 markets: Eurax, Oilatum, Polytar/Tarmed, Savlon, Ceridal which are skin care brands, as well as a children's cough medicine called Tixylix.

""The intended divestment of these brands is to Stada, a publicly-listed company which specialises in pharmaceuticals and non-prescription consumer healthcare products, with headquarters in Bad Vilbel, Germany.

68,Ford: No Brexit link to Bridgend plant closure,James Sillars,"Ford has confirmed plans to close its engine plant at Bridgend in South Wales by September 2020, saying it faced becoming ""economically unsustainable"" in the world's drive for electric vehicles.

The company ruled out a Brexit link after it made the formal announcement, saying that consultations on its proposals had begun with its 1,700 staff and their representatives.

Unions accused the firm of betraying the workforce and wider supply chain while Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged the company to reconsider.

Stuart Rowley, president of Ford Europe, told reporters: ""This action has nothing to do with Brexit and the simple way to think of that is, if Brexit had never happened, would there be a different decision, and the answer to that is no.""

He explained: ""Creating a strong and sustainable Ford business in Europe requires us to make some difficult decisions, including the need to scale our global engine manufacturing footprint to best serve our future vehicle portfolio.

Image: An assembly line at Ford's Bridgend plant

""We are committed to the UK; however, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.""

""As a major employer in the UK for more than a century, we know that closing Bridgend would be difficult for many of our employees.

""We recognise the effects it would have on their families and the communities where they live and, as a responsible employer, we are proposing a plan that would help to ease the impact.""

The company said its proposals would see production of the latest 1.5 litre engine end in February - ahead of the closure later in the year - and insisted its other UK engine plant remained a ""core"" part of its UK business.

It estimated a one-off charge of £650m to complete the Bridgend shutdown.

The factory, which opened over 40 years ago, has faced a series of recent cutbacks as orders dried up amid the growing backlash against petrol and diesel engines in favour of electric vehicles.

Sky News revealed in February that a voluntary redundancy programme would result in 400 job losses - with 600 further posts at Bridgend under threat as Ford moved to cut costs and boost profitability.

It announced just weeks ago that 550 jobs at its Dunton technical centre were to go as part of 7,000 job losses worldwide.

'Everyone's devastated' at Bridgend factory

The industry is grappling not only with the environmental challenge but also vying to win the race for self-driving technology at a time of tougher conditions for the world economy.

The US-China trade war has been blamed for depressing demand for new vehicles in key markets.

The company told Sky News earlier this year it would have to carefully consider its British business in the event of a no-deal Brexit and confirmed that remained the case, despite a commitment to its current UK operations on Thursday.

The UK car industry has been one of the most vocal opponents of a so-called messy divorce from the EU, saying it is imperative that the flow of goods is maintained and that products remain tariff-free.

Ford is the latest firm to cut back in the UK as the Brexit issue remains unresolved and the sector looks for savings to invest in the future.

'No-deal Brexit is not an option for Ford'

Honda is to cease production at its Swindon plant by 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, while Jaguar Land Rover is cutting 4,500 roles.

Nissan also announced it had cancelled plans to build its new X-Trail in Sunderland.

The Unite union's general secretary Len McCluskey reacted angrily by saying it would fight the Bridgend closure ""with all our might"".

He said: ""These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers - this is still Ford's largest European market - through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.

""Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000.

""The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle - car or van - is made in the UK.""","Ford has confirmed plans to close its engine plant at Bridgend in South Wales by September 2020, saying it faced becoming ""economically unsustainable"" in the world's drive for electric vehicles.

69,Ford: No Brexit link to Bridgend plant closure,Business Reporter,"Ford has confirmed plans to close its engine plant at Bridgend in South Wales by September 2020, saying it faced becoming ""economically unsustainable"" in the world's drive for electric vehicles.

The company ruled out a Brexit link after it made the formal announcement, saying that consultations on its proposals had begun with its 1,700 staff and their representatives.

Unions accused the firm of betraying the workforce and wider supply chain while Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged the company to reconsider.

Stuart Rowley, president of Ford Europe, told reporters: ""This action has nothing to do with Brexit and the simple way to think of that is, if Brexit had never happened, would there be a different decision, and the answer to that is no.""

He explained: ""Creating a strong and sustainable Ford business in Europe requires us to make some difficult decisions, including the need to scale our global engine manufacturing footprint to best serve our future vehicle portfolio.

""We are committed to the UK; however, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead.""

""As a major employer in the UK for more than a century, we know that closing Bridgend would be difficult for many of our employees.

""We recognise the effects it would have on their families and the communities where they live and, as a responsible employer, we are proposing a plan that would help to ease the impact.""

The company said its proposals would see production of the latest 1.5 litre engine end in February - ahead of the closure later in the year - and insisted its other UK engine plant remained a ""core"" part of its UK business.

It estimated a one-off charge of £650m to complete the Bridgend shutdown.

The factory, which opened over 40 years ago, has faced a series of recent cutbacks as orders dried up amid the growing backlash against petrol and diesel engines in favour of electric vehicles.

Sky News revealed in February that a voluntary redundancy programme would result in 400 job losses - with 600 further posts at Bridgend under threat as Ford moved to cut costs and boost profitability.

It announced just weeks ago that 550 jobs at its Dunton technical centre were to go as part of 7,000 job losses worldwide.

'Everyone's devastated' at Bridgend factory

The industry is grappling not only with the environmental challenge but also vying to win the race for self-driving technology at a time of tougher conditions for the world economy.

The US-China trade war has been blamed for depressing demand for new vehicles in key markets.

The company told Sky News earlier this year it would have to carefully consider its British business in the event of a no-deal Brexit and confirmed that remained the case, despite a commitment to its current UK operations on Thursday.

The UK car industry has been one of the most vocal opponents of a so-called messy divorce from the EU, saying it is imperative that the flow of goods is maintained and that products remain tariff-free.

Ford is the latest firm to cut back in the UK as the Brexit issue remains unresolved and the sector looks for savings to invest in the future.

'No-deal Brexit is not an option for Ford'

Honda is to cease production at its Swindon plant by 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, while Jaguar Land Rover is cutting 4,500 roles.

Nissan also announced it had cancelled plans to build its new X-Trail in Sunderland.

The Unite union's general secretary Len McCluskey reacted angrily by saying it would fight the Bridgend closure ""with all our might"".

He said: ""These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers - this is still Ford's largest European market - through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.

""Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000.

70,MPs summon ITV chiefs to give evidence in reality TV probe,Mark Kleinman,"ITV's bosses have been summoned to gi‎ve evidence to a parliamentary probe into reality television launched in the wake of the death of a guest on The Jeremy Kyle Show.

Sky News has learnt that the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee will announce on Friday that Sir Peter Bazalgette and Dame Carolyn McCall - ITV's chairman and chief executive respectively - are to appear before it later this month.

Their evidence session will be one of several scheduled by the committee as‎ it examines the duty of care owed to reality TV participants by broadcasters and production companies.

The launch of the inquiry came within hours of ITV announcing that it had permanently cancelled The Jeremy Kyle Show, after it emerged that a participant had died soon after the episode in which he featured had been filmed.

Dame Carolyn ‎said the decision to end production of the popular daytime programme had been taken in light of ""the gravity of recent events"".

The chair of the culture select committee, Damian Collins MP, said that programmes featuring people trying to resolve personal problems under a public ‎spotlight had carried significant risks.

""There needs to be an independent review of the duty of care TV companies have to participants in reality TV shows,"" Mr Collins said.

The issue of the vulnerability of reality TV participants has been increasingly closely scrutinised, with two former contestants on the dating show Love Island - also broadcast by ITV - having taken their own lives a number of years after appearing on the programme.

Announcing the launch of the latest series of Love Island last month‎, ITV outlined an extensive duty of care process including the availability of a psychological consultant and training on dealing with social media attention after the show has ended.

A source close to ITV said it welcomed the chance for Sir Peter and Dame Carolyn to highlight the company's commitment to the welfare of reality TV participants.

Ms McCall, the former boss of easyJet, has run ITV for nearly 18 months, during which the broadcaster's shares have fallen sharply amid continuing pressure on advertising revenues.

72,UK adults shun cash in favour of card payments,Wale Azeez,"Nearly 70% of adults across the UK now use contactless payments

Cash spending in the UK moved a step closer to being obsolete last year, as millions of adults moved away from notes and coins in favour of cards.

According to research from UK Finance, the trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector, 10% of the adult population - around 5.4 million people - made either one or no cash payments per month in 2018.

It said this marked a jump of two million people compared with 2017, when 3.4 million hardly used cash.

Image: Debit cards were the most frequently used method in 2018 with 38% of all payments

However, 25% of adults still rely on cash as their main spending method.

Cash was the primary means of spending for 4% of consumers in 2018 - 1.9 million people - although most paid bills using other methods, in what UK Finance called a ""pick 'n' mix approach"" to payments.

The report said cash was used in 28% of all payments in 2018.

Debit cards remained the most frequently used payment method in 2018 with 38% of all payments, plastic having overtaken cash in 2017.

Ongoing bank branch and ATM closures have heightened concerns about people's continued access to cash.

Free-to-use cash machines are also fast disappearing from Britain's high streets and transit stops, with more than 1,000 ATMs converted to charge fees in March alone, according to the consumer group Which?

Contactless payments continued to gain popularity last year following a rise in the adoption of technologies accepting such payments on public transport and an increase in the single payment limit on contactless cards to £30 in 2015.

Nearly 70% of adults across the UK now use contactless payments.

Up to a fifth of payments made by consumers in 2018 were contactless, up from 16% in 2017.

The research found that people in the South East and East Anglia were most likely to use contactless, (71%) and least likely in the North West of England at 53%.

Older customers were increasingly embracing the technology, with more than three-fifths (61%) of over-65s making contactless payments in 2018, up from 50% in 2017.

The association's UK Payment Markets report found that nearly half of UK adults - 48% - used mobile banking in 2018, up from 41% the previous year.

By the year end, an estimated 8.5 million people or 16% of the adult population, were registered to use mobile payment services such as Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, up from just 2% in 2016.

Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: ""The same pick 'n' mix approach people now take when it comes to music, television or the news is expanding into payments, as consumers take advantage of new technologies to pay in a way that suits them.

Image: Cash was used in 28% of all payments in 2018, UK Finance says

""This rapid rate of technological change is set to continue over the coming decade, as people embrace the ever-widening number of ways to pay and manage their finances, depending on their needs and lifestyle.

But he warned that cash remained a valued payment method to which access should be maintained, ""to ensure no customer is left behind.""

74,Fiat Chrysler drives away from Renault merger talks,James Sillars,"Fiat Chrysler feared interference by the French government in an enlarged complany

Fiat Chrysler has withdrawn its offer to merge with Renault, blaming the French government for its decision.

The Italian-American automaker had announced last month a proposal for a 50:50 tie-up as the global industry grapples a series of challenges - mainly the costly drive for electric and self-driving vehicles as petrol and diesel are demonised.

It said a tie-up would have allowed for collective savings of €5bn (£4.4bn) of savings annually and created the world's third-largest carmaker behind only VW and Toyota.

:: Fears for 1,700 jobs as Ford to close Bridgend plant

Image: Renault made it clear that the French government was concerned about the deal's implications

Had Nissan, which counts Renault as its largest shareholder, joined in then the company would have been the biggest company by production in the sector.

But, in a shock move late on Wednesday night, Fiat Chrysler drove away from the deal placing the blame at the foot of the French government.

It owns a 15% stake in Renault and would have had to approve the deal and, crucially, could have also potentially blocked any job losses or plant closures that followed as part of cost-saving measures.

:: Jaguar Land Rover and BMW for electric partnership

Nissan, the French government and Renault's CGT union were all understood to have had deep reservations about the deal.

In the Japanese company's case, its relationship with Renault has been severely tested since the whiff of scandal first arose last year around the head of their joint venture, Carlos Ghosn.

He is currently awaiting trial in Tokyo for alleged financial misconduct - which he denies.

Mr Ghosn has subsequently faced further claims surrounding his use of company funds at both Nissan and Renault.

Officials in Paris were understood to have been mostly concerned about job security.

Renault shares were as much as 7% lower in reaction to the decision.

""Winter is coming,"" uttered Ned Stark, warning of a seemingly impending doom that could change the future of Westeros before audiences had even had much of a chance to get a sense for its present.

Amid all the introductions to the then relatively carefree lives of the characters of Game Of Thrones, it was a bleak hint to those who tuned into the debut episode more than eight years ago that things would soon take a turn for the worse.

Image: Ned Stark's death was one of the first shocking moments of the entire show. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic

But, with sixth form in full flow and still somewhat embarrassingly untrusted with the Sky box PIN required to open my eyes to a world of brutal murder and little modesty, my focus was instead firmly placed on a different - if not similarly menacing - warning: ""Exams are coming.""

Growing up in a household that required me to make covert visits to a friend to sample the new Grand Theft Auto or other such adult entertainment (sorry, Mum, sometimes it wasn't actually homework), Thrones meant the living room door was kept firmly shut each Monday evening to ensure my younger sister and I were not too easily exposed to the horrors of beheadings and brothels.

""But look how young that girl looks,"" my sister would likely have thought of Arya Stark, wondering why she was deemed unsuited to watching a show that starred a girl even fresher-faced than the both of us.

Thankfully, once those final school exams were out of the way (German being the Red Wedding of the bunch), university was on the horizon and freedom with it.

Looking back, student hall discussions without Thrones seems akin to Laurel without Hardy, but unlike other university topics of conversation (""How many jaegerbombs was it last night?"", ""What do you mean the essay is due tomorrow?!""), the goings-on in the Seven Kingdoms has remained the perfect small talk.

Several years and thousands of deaths later, Thrones is a fixture of family dinners, catch-ups with friends and office chit-chat whenever it returns to our screens.

There is just as much fervour when talking about the latest twists and turns with co-workers in 2019 as there was with university flatmates in 2012 - possibly even more so.

Chatting and thinking about the fate of our favourite characters has become part of our routine, and the need to keep up has only grown more urgent with social media now such a merciless hive of spoilerrific memes.

With so many fans now willing to stay up into the small hours to watch new episodes in-time with the US, checking your news feed on a Monday morning is like navigating a white walker-laden minefield.

Even my Sunday League changing room has become a welcome home to theories about what might happen as we inch ever closer to the finale, which might explain why we seem to know more about the history of Winterfell than we do about how to defend.

It is testament to the careful web that has been weaved over the past eight years - now going beyond even the books on which the show was originally based - that we all remain on such tenterhooks.

Thrones actress: 'Women by default are strong'

The end is certainly going to feel all the stranger to those of us for whom the story has followed through so many different stages of life.

Ned lost his head while I was still at school and now his youngest daughter - that fresh-faced girl I thought was sufficient proof I was old enough to watch the show back then - has grown to womanhood and defeated the winter threat her father warned us about.

She was also one of the few to survive Daenerys Targaryen's fiery onslaught of King's Landing, a genocidal move that appears to have split fans like few other sequences have since the show began.

The final big question, the one that will surely mark the very end of the series, is who ends up on the Iron Throne.

Despite some questionable twists in this divisive final season, I remain excited to find out.

""But look how young that girl looks,"" my sister would likely have thought of Arya Stark, wondering why she was deemed unsuited to watching a show that starred a girl even fresher-faced than the both of us.

Thankfully, once those final school exams were out of the way (German being the Red Wedding of the bunch), university was on the horizon and freedom with it.

Looking back, student hall discussions without Thrones seems akin to Laurel without Hardy, but unlike other university topics of conversation (""How many jaegerbombs was it last night?"", ""What do you mean the essay is due tomorrow?!""), the goings-on in the Seven Kingdoms has remained the perfect small talk.

Several years and thousands of deaths later, Thrones is a fixture of family dinners, catch-ups with friends and office chit-chat whenever it returns to our screens.

There is just as much fervour when talking about the latest twists and turns with co-workers in 2019 as there was with university flatmates in 2012 - possibly even more so.

Chatting and thinking about the fate of our favourite characters has become part of our routine, and the need to keep up has only grown more urgent with social media now such a merciless hive of spoilerrific memes.

With so many fans now willing to stay up into the small hours to watch new episodes in-time with the US, checking your news feed on a Monday morning is like navigating a white walker-laden minefield.

Even my Sunday League changing room has become a welcome home to theories about what might happen as we inch ever closer to the finale, which might explain why we seem to know more about the history of Winterfell than we do about how to defend.

It is testament to the careful web that has been weaved over the past eight years - now going beyond even the books on which the show was originally based - that we all remain on such tenterhooks.

Thrones actress: 'Women by default are strong'

The end is certainly going to feel all the stranger to those of us for whom the story has followed through so many different stages of life.

Ned lost his head while I was still at school and now his youngest daughter - that fresh-faced girl I thought was sufficient proof I was old enough to watch the show back then - has grown to womanhood and defeated the winter threat her father warned us about.

She was also one of the few to survive Daenerys Targaryen's fiery onslaught of King's Landing, a genocidal move that appears to have split fans like few other sequences have since the show began.

The final big question, the one that will surely mark the very end of the series, is who ends up on the Iron Throne.

Despite some questionable twists in this divisive final season, I remain excited to find out.

But, with Thrones about to become absent from our screens for the first time since I still had homework to do, I'm not sure I'm ready.","'I'm not ready for it to end': Growing up with Game Of Thrones'I'm not ready for it to end': Growing up with Game Of ThronesArya Stark has grown into a brave warrior from the young teenager she was when Game Of Thrones began.

The explorers of soul: Why millennials are turning to poetry

The announcement of the new poet laureate comes when the popularity of verse is soaring

Britain's new poet laureate has been unveiled as Simon Armitage, who says he wants to ""help poetry explore its potential"" in a multi-media age.

To celebrate the announcement, poet Mica Montana tells Sky News why millennials are turning to poetry to help them understand the world around them.

The questions of meaning and identity for our generation are no longer answerable by occupation, what we can achieve or what degrees we hold, because we have seen how these things have failed to hold the minds of those in the generations before us.

Before we work, we want to know who we are. We want to know who we can be. What it means to feel.

Image: Mica Montana tells Sky News the answers to life's questions come from poets

We want to know our souls deeper in order to manage our mental health. To know what it means to exist as a human being.

The answers to these questions come from the poets. The explorers of soul. The revealers of heart. Those who re-present life and remind us that there is a beauty within it.

Those who re-introduce the wonder of being alive that has been drowned out by the obligations of society.

Image: 'Reading poetry has been a reminder of what it is to be human'

It's through the poets, poetry, that we can encounter ourselves. Identify our thoughts, explore our emotions and find who we are.

It is through poetry that the private life of the soul is made public. Through poetry we remember that love, joy, tragedy and heartbreak are not solo experiences of the heart but are integral to being human.

Through poetry we discover that our experiences of heart are worthy of being heard, expressed, and shared.

81,Sexual crime is dark and damaging - tackling it is too,Adele Robinson,"Sexual crime is dark and damaging - tackling it is too

Sexual crime is dark and damaging - tackling it is too

Circles teach their volunteers how best to approach the people they are being tasked with helping

I want to make it crystal clear that I do not sympathise with - and cannot and never will make excuses for - sex offenders.

What they have done is perhaps the most heinous and damaging thing a human can do to another.

However, I am also aware this is something society simply does not want to talk about - and yet it absolutely should.

It is a conversation we must all be forced into: what to do with sex offenders once they are released from prison?

Image: Volunteers form 'circles' to support the offender

""Lock them up, throw away the key,"" I hear you say.

Advertisement

The reality is that this is not possible - not least because of the burden to taxpayers, but also, as with any crime, there is a wide spectrum of offences carrying different sentences.

We need to confront head on the fact that many sex offenders need support to prevent re-offending.

There is a stark difference, by the way, between sympathising with a sex offender and supporting one with the aim of rehabilitation. That is something the charity Circles UK deals with head on.

As one female volunteer described it to me: ""We are not friends with the 'core member' (sex offender), in no way are we friends. We would never condone offences, but we are not reducing him to his offence, we are trying to move on past that and get him away from wanting to do anything like that.""

Image: Rachel says she supports the work of Circles, even though she is a rape victim

I was able to experience a Circle in action in the South West, which was at times fascinating, moving and terrifying.

In front of me was a sex offender, or ""core member"", who had committed horrendous crimes.

To my view, over a number of weeks, he appeared contrite (core members are only allowed into a circle if they show remorse) and also, at times, I think scared.

He made no excuses for what he had done. He himself was a victim of abuse in childhood.

At times I found it hard to reconcile the person in front of me with the crimes he had committed. He seemed articulate and resolute. He seemed ""normal"".

He described being ""ashamed"" of his offences, saying he understood if his victims wished him dead. At times the conversation fluctuated between the mundane and also tackling grim issues: one example - a dilemma over disclosure of his crimes to new friends.

Throughout I questioned myself - does he mean it when he says he's ashamed and sorry? Can he in fact rehabilitate?

There were moments when he opened up to the circle, while I was observing in the corner. It was then that the power of a circle in action, members of the community giving up their time, for free and to help, became apparent.

Image: The charity struggles to recruit volunteers due to the nature of the work

It is of course difficult to know for sure whether this circle will work for this particular person but he seemed determined.

Most importantly the circle of volunteers appeared to regularly challenge him on his world view and decision making and push him towards reintegration, in a safe way.

I felt naturally conflicted but optimistic when I left, and as a volunteer I would imagine you have to be. A circle is an extra layer of protection for the public around a sex offender - in addition to police and probation.

It is powerful because it is unique. It is the community taking ownership of sexual abuse. Volunteers, ordinary members of the public, who are trying to prevent re-offending.

They are attempting to own sexual abuse in society in the same way we try to do with drugs and homelessness. The simple aim of Circles UK is ""no more victims"" and it is difficult to argue with that, isn't it?

That said, for many sexual abuse victims, and those close to them, the idea of ""supporting"" a sex offender will seem unpalatable. That's understandable - and it is also why Circles UK struggles to get funding.

""We are absolutely at the bottom of the pile when it comes to fundraising,"" chief executive Riana Taylor tells me.

Volunteering for Circles clearly isn't for everyone. It is one of the aspects I find most fascinating about the work this charity does: you need to go into it with an open mind.

I guess ultimately it comes down to answering a very difficult question, which won't be the case for every offender either.

Is a sexual offender simply a sexual offender? Or is he/she a person, an individual, who has committed sexual offences?

The answer to that question may be the difference between those who can volunteer and those who can't.

We should also ask ourselves - is something that aims to keep us safer as a community a bad thing?

It can't be. But that doesn't mean it's easy.

Sexual crime is dark and damaging, complex and difficult, and so any possible or potential answer to tackling it will inevitably be dark and difficult too.","Sexual crime is dark and damaging - tackling it is tooSexual crime is dark and damaging - tackling it is tooCircles teach their volunteers how best to approach the people they are being tasked with helpingI want to make it crystal clear that I do not sympathise with - and cannot and never will make excuses for - sex offenders.

Crohn's sufferer: 'I've been asked to show my colostomy bag to prove my condition'

Ms Elliot has suffered with the condition for five years

Georgina Elliot, 21, is living with Crohn's disease and posts videos to YouTube documenting her experiences.

Now she is calling for more public understanding about the condition.

The majority of people with invisible disabilities are being abused and humiliated when trying to use disabled toilets in public, according to a survey.

Crohn's and Colitis UK found 61% of people with the bowel conditions had experienced verbal or physical abuse for using disabled facilities and nearly two-thirds had not been allowed to jump the queue when in a desperate situation.

Ms Elliot was first diagnosed with Crohn's in 2017, after experiencing symptoms for three years and struggling to get a true diagnosis.

The influencer said finding out about the disease made her ""really, really scared"", especially as it is incurable and sufferers will have Crohn's for life.

Image: Georgina Elliot is calling for more understanding of Crohn's disease

She said she knew ""nothing about it"" beforehand and assumed that people with Crohn's simply ""go to the toilet all the time"".

""It's not at all - that's like 5% of the stuff we have to go through,"" she said.

""There's the fatigue, sleeping 19 hours if we can without someone waking us up, the joint pain, sore pain when you walk, not being able to eat anything without agony. It's not nice.""

She added the disease had knocked her confidence and made her feel ""incapable"" after realising she could no longer keep up with friends.

""I couldn't do things that my friends could do in the sense that I'd go out with them and I'd get drunk with them and have a great time and I'd party but after, it would take the life out of me and I wouldn't be able to function for about two days.

""And that's quite a mental block because I'm young - I'm only 21 now so since I was about 17, I've not had as much energy as anyone else.""

The 21-year-old has experienced negative reactions when trying to explain her condition - including disbelief.

Image: The influencer posts videos to her YouTube channel documenting her daily life with the condition

""It's something I openly discuss with people. I'm never ashamed to have my bag,"" she said.

""But then also it's quite hard because people can be quite shut off to that.

""If you do explain it, if they can't see it then they don't believe it.

""That's one of the hardest things because you then feel like you're moaning about nothing because they make out that it's nothing so you play it down, which inevitably with Crohn's disease, makes you more poorly because you have to tend to it and you have to be aware of it all the time.""

Ms Elliot said she has faced a number of events which made her feel uncomfortable, including an incident outside a nightclub where a bouncer would not believe she was carrying a colostomy bag - instead thinking she was trying to smuggle in alcohol.

After not being allowed into the venue for 20 minutes, she eventually showed the bouncer her colostomy bag - but said it had ""ruined"" her night.

Image: Georgina says she felt 'scared' about being diagnosed with Crohn's

""It's private to me. It's something I have to deal with. It's not something I should have to show you for you to be compassionate towards me,"" she added.

On another occasion, she was trying to empty her bag inside train toilets when a guard began knocking on the door to check she was alright.

""Everything was absolutely fine - I just needed five minutes of privacy,"" Ms Elliot said.

She has also been confronted when waiting in the queue for disabled toilets and forced to explain her condition.

The influencer said: ""I feel like I shouldn't have to explain the ins and outs of my disease to people.""

However she admitted that she had once been ""naive"" and ""ignorant"" to the condition as she had not been taught about it.

""People need to have the confidence, especially Crohn's and colitis sufferers, to be open and talk about it because as much as people need to be understanding of us, we need to be understanding that people don't know a lot about it,"" she said.

After not being allowed into the venue for 20 minutes, she eventually showed the bouncer her colostomy bag - but said it had ""ruined"" her night.

""It's private to me. It's something I have to deal with. It's not something I should have to show you for you to be compassionate towards me,"" she added.

On another occasion, she was trying to empty her bag inside train toilets when a guard began knocking on the door to check she was alright.

""Everything was absolutely fine - I just needed five minutes of privacy,"" Ms Elliot said.

She has also been confronted when waiting in the queue for disabled toilets and forced to explain her condition.

The influencer said: ""I feel like I shouldn't have to explain the ins and outs of my disease to people.""

However she admitted that she had once been ""naive"" and ""ignorant"" to the condition as she had not been taught about it.

""People need to have the confidence, especially Crohn's and colitis sufferers, to be open and talk about it because as much as people need to be understanding of us, we need to be understanding that people don't know a lot about it,"" she said.

85,Decline in use of stop and search has gone too far,Chief Constable Mike Cunningham,"Decline in use of stop and search has gone too far

Decline in use of stop and search has gone too far

The use of stop and search has decreased in recent years

The devastation caused by the tragic deaths of young people who have been stabbed on our streets is clear.

Our police officers and staff have demonstrated their ongoing professionalism and public service in an attempt to tackle this awful crime.

However, we cannot solve the problem on our own.

Deadly knife found in stop-and-search operation

Police action like the targeted use of stop and search can make a real difference in disrupting knife crime in the short term.

Its use helps to detect knife crime and can prevent further harm by removing weapons from our streets.

Research has estimated that more than 80% of all arrests for offensive weapons by the Metropolitan Police resulted from a stop and search.

Image: Chief Constable Mike Cunningham says police cannot solve knife crime on their own

In recent years, however, the use of this power by the police has decreased dramatically due to legitimate concerns over its use and the alienation of young people in local communities.

Many police officers, of all ranks, believe strongly that their confidence has been undermined and the decline in its use has gone too far.

When young people continue to die on our streets, its short-term impact in hotspot areas of crime cannot be ignored.

It is important the police have full confidence to use this power fairly and to good effect.

I have long supported the decision announced by the government on Sunday to allow a swifter response to protecting the public in crisis situations.

The recent financial support for the police response is welcome, but we should not assume that with more resources policing alone can solve this problem.

In the long run, police powers are tools and not a magic wand. Evidence shows that over an extended period, stop and search has only a marginal deterrent effect on violent crime.

Respect, professional public engagement, and careful management of situations where there is potential for conflict are an absolute necessity to avoid the erosion of trust in policing and the perpetuation of knife crime.

To truly solve the problem it is vital that we act on the underlying reasons which can lead to young people using weapons, including neglect and abuse in childhood.

Image: Neglect and abuse in childhood can lead to young people carrying weapons

Approaches which include close cross-sector working seem to have played a significant role in violence reduction in Glasgow and have been tested to great effect in America.

These combine the stick of tough enforcement with the carrot of better education, healthcare and access to alternatives to a life of crime. When this type of approach is supported across different partner agencies, joint working can help guide young people towards making the right choices.

There is innovative work already happening across policing to deliver on this aim, and some of the most promising initiatives are being tested now.

Stop and search: Police powers increased

I will be sharing this work with others at the prime minister's summit today, in the hope that policing's leadership will drive tangible activity across all sectors.

With the right support and resources, I know that officers and staff will work just as tirelessly to prevent violent crime as they do reacting to it in a time of crisis.

If partners across health, education and local government play their part, we can make a real difference and help prevent more tragic deaths.","Decline in use of stop and search has gone too farDecline in use of stop and search has gone too farThe use of stop and search has decreased in recent yearsThe devastation caused by the tragic deaths of young people who have been stabbed on our streets is clear.

87,Love Island's Eyal Booker: 'No amount of support can prepare you for fame',Gemma Peplow,"Former Love Islander Eyal Booker has spoken out to stand up for the show over the issues of diversity and support for contestants that have made headlines in recent weeks.

The reality star, who appeared in last year's Love Island alongside Dani Dyer, Jack Fincham, Megan Barton Hanson and Dr Alex George, told Sky News he could not fault producers for the care he received both before and after his time in the villa.

:: Jeremy Kyle asked to attend parliament's reality TV inquiry

It comes after the series, which started its fifth season on Monday, promised to increase the level of support following the suicides of two former contestants.

The dating show, which sees young singles partnering up while spending the summer living in a villa in Majorca, has also faced criticism about diversity, or lack of it, when it comes to casting people of different body sizes and races.

Speaking about support and aftercare, Booker said: ""I don't have a bad word to say because I have been supported before the process, during the process and after the process up until now, and I will continue to be supported.

""I think that as a show progresses, as it grows, as it builds, [the producers] start to put more in place because you realise that it's needed. I can't fault it for my own experience.""

Booker said producers had been back in touch with him ""every couple of months"" since he left the show.

He also said that no matter what support measures are in place, ""I don't personally believe anything can prepare you for fame"".

""Somebody can talk to you as much as they want about trying to prepare you but everybody is different...

""I think the show tries to prepare you as much as possible but it's all kind of... you can't believe it until it happens so there's no preparation.""

Image: Sophie Gradon, who appeared on the show in 2016, also took her own life

Following his stint in the Love Island villa, Booker has remained on TV, appearing on Celebs Go Dating last year.

He is currently working on a new documentary which he says will ""spark a lot of conversation"" and get people ""to question themselves and others around them"", but would not give any further details.

He said his experience of fame has been mainly positive.

""Don't get me wrong, it's been a journey,"" he said. ""There were some amazing points and there were some low points and then I've kind of refound myself and I'm doing better than ever. But that's the journey of life, not every day's a good day.

""I think it just takes some getting used to, and having good family and friends around you who continue to support you and remember who you are as before the fame.""

Booker said the initial experience after leaving the villa was ""kind of overwhelming and also a lot of fun"".

""You know all of a sudden, you're walking through the airport and everyone in the airport knows who you are…

""As long as people are nice, they're respectful, they appreciate the fact that you're a human being and you're not just some cardboard cut-out that doesn't have any feelings then I think it's quite easy to deal with.

""At times maybe it gets a bit much but then you just make sure you're not going to the busiest place and you're not being in the thick of it. You just remove yourself from it slightly.""

He said that after Love Island he had not felt the need to take up the offer of support from producers ""because my family and friends are incredible and they continue to support me, they continue to keep me grounded and they continue to remind me of the person I was before all of this fame"".

Addressing the issue of diversity on the show, he said he believes the series ""showcases diversity at this moment in time"" but people need to remember Love Island is a dating show.

""The original line-up is a diverse line-up [this year],"" he said. ""We have to remember that isn't how it's going to stay. There's probably about 30 people that are going to walk through the doors of that villa within the season. We've got to give them a chance to showcase diversity.

""And I also believe that it's a dating show. You know there's an element that they have to showcase diversity but it's also they're no more than what they're saying they are, which is a dating show and the point is for people to go in the villa to couple up, sleep in the same bed and hopefully create a relationship.

90,Liam Gallagher: I wanted to break Noel's jaw over Oasis songs for film,Gemma Peplow,"Liam Gallagher talks to Sky News about his new biopic, living life after Oasis and his rivalry with his brother Noel

Liam Gallagher has opened up about the emotional side of his new documentary at the film's world premiere - but also couldn't resist taking an angry swipe at big brother Noel.

The rock 'n' roll star spoke to Sky News on the red carpet at London's Alexandra Palace for the screening of As It Was, which documents ""the musical comeback of the decade"" following the Oasis split.

While the film features his own solo music, there are no Oasis tracks - because Noel, as the main songwriter for the band, apparently refused to give permission.

""Him and his little people saw it and took the Oasis music out of it because that's all he's got left, d'ya know what I mean,"" Liam said. ""Let him get on with it.

""It doesn't make me sad, it makes me f****** mad. I'm not a p****, I'm not sad about it, I want to break his f****** jaw and his daft f****** manager, but that's what happens. I'm not sad about it, I didn't go home and cry, I just wanted to go and f****** put their windows through.""

However, Liam also said that he had always wanted to reform the band and that his ""bags are packed"" should a reunion ever be on the cards.

Ten years in the making, As It Was gives fans a glimpse of the man behind the swaggering rock star image, and shows the singer talking openly about the low points he has been through since Noel called time on Oasis in 2009.

Liam's family members also feature.

""The stuff with me mam, the cameras going to me mam's house, that was pretty emotional,"" he said. ""Me daughter's in it, me kids, me missus and all that. It's all kind of pretty emotional, really.

""When people talk about how much you mean to them and all that stuff, that's pretty emotional.""

:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

But returning to frontman form, he added: ""Other than that it's just f****** rock 'n' roll isn't it? It's rock 'n' roll.""

Liam said the film was ""more of a documentary than a film, it's not f****** Star Wars, although it's got a few stars at war in it"".

The singer also joked that he ""got bored sh*tless"" watching it ""because it's about me"".

One scene in the documentary shows him jogging in San Francisco, and talking about how proud he is to still be around after years of excess.

""I've never been to rehab, I don't do smack on a Sunday, I don't do cocaine on a Sunday, I don't eat burgers on Sundays and sh*t like that, so I'm proud that I've still got it together,"" he said.

""Right up there,"" he added, pointing to his head. ""I might not look like it but it's still all f****** going on up there.

Image: Liam Gallagher, with Oasis, at the Caracas Pop Festival in 2001

""I didn't join a band to f****** be a dick. I was doing drugs before I got in a band so I'm not one of them that go, 'I'm in a band now so let's have a line of speed' or whatever, I was doing that sh*t when I was 15, so it was all f******* old hat by the time I got in it. The drugs just got a bit better, the clothes got better and you got to see the world.""

But for the time being he is happy living a healthier lifestyle.

""At the moment I'm happier doing what I'm doing but if I want to go and get off me box I'll do it,"" he said. ""Cos no one can stop me.""

Gavin Fitzgerald and Charlie Lightening, who directed the documentary, also attended the premiere, along with stars including Richard Ashcroft, Kasabian's Tom Meighan and actress Vicky McClure.

Fitzgerald told Sky News the film showed a different side to the Liam people are used to seeing.

""You ask him a question and he answers flippantly, and then you brush it off… and then you watch back the footage and realise what he said there was completely ingenious.

""He's a comic genius, I believe.""

Is Liam Gallagher a man who can take direction, be bossed around?

""He's not the worst of the divas, I think he's pretty easy to get along with. He interacts with people very well, he'll chat to anyone.

91,Liam Gallagher: I wanted to break Noel's jaw over Oasis songs for film,Arts,"Liam Gallagher talks to Sky News about his new biopic, living life after Oasis and his rivalry with his brother Noel

Liam Gallagher has opened up about the emotional side of his new documentary at the film's world premiere - but also couldn't resist taking an angry swipe at big brother Noel.

The rock 'n' roll star spoke to Sky News on the red carpet at London's Alexandra Palace for the screening of As It Was, which documents ""the musical comeback of the decade"" following the Oasis split.

While the film features his own solo music, there are no Oasis tracks - because Noel, as the main songwriter for the band, apparently refused to give permission.

""Him and his little people saw it and took the Oasis music out of it because that's all he's got left, d'ya know what I mean,"" Liam said. ""Let him get on with it.

""It doesn't make me sad, it makes me f****** mad. I'm not a p****, I'm not sad about it, I want to break his f****** jaw and his daft f****** manager, but that's what happens. I'm not sad about it, I didn't go home and cry, I just wanted to go and f****** put their windows through.""

However, Liam also said that he had always wanted to reform the band and that his ""bags are packed"" should a reunion ever be on the cards.

Ten years in the making, As It Was gives fans a glimpse of the man behind the swaggering rock star image, and shows the singer talking openly about the low points he has been through since Noel called time on Oasis in 2009.

Liam's family members also feature.

""The stuff with me mam, the cameras going to me mam's house, that was pretty emotional,"" he said. ""Me daughter's in it, me kids, me missus and all that. It's all kind of pretty emotional, really.

""When people talk about how much you mean to them and all that stuff, that's pretty emotional.""

But returning to frontman form, he added: ""Other than that it's just f****** rock 'n' roll isn't it? It's rock 'n' roll.""

Liam said the film was ""more of a documentary than a film, it's not f****** Star Wars, although it's got a few stars at war in it"".

The singer also joked that he ""got bored sh*tless"" watching it ""because it's about me"".

One scene in the documentary shows him jogging in San Francisco, and talking about how proud he is to still be around after years of excess.

""I've never been to rehab, I don't do smack on a Sunday, I don't do cocaine on a Sunday, I don't eat burgers on Sundays and sh*t like that, so I'm proud that I've still got it together,"" he said.

""Right up there,"" he added, pointing to his head. ""I might not look like it but it's still all f****** going on up there.

""I didn't join a band to f****** be a dick.

The drugs just got a bit better, the clothes got better and you got to see the world.""

But for the time being he is happy living a healthier lifestyle.

""At the moment I'm happier doing what I'm doing but if I want to go and get off me box I'll do it,"" he said. ""Cos no one can stop me.""

Gavin Fitzgerald and Charlie Lightening, who directed the documentary, also attended the premiere, along with stars including Richard Ashcroft, Kasabian's Tom Meighan and actress Vicky McClure.

Fitzgerald told Sky News the film showed a different side to the Liam people are used to seeing.

""You ask him a question and he answers flippantly, and then you brush it off… and then you watch back the footage and realise what he said there was completely ingenious.

Country singer Granger Smith has announced his youngest son, River Kelly Smith, has died following a ""tragic accident"".

A representative for the American star said the three-year-old drowned in the family's backyard swimming pool, US media reported.

Smith, 39, shared the ""unthinkable news"" on Twitter and Instagram, saying his son was unable to be revived despite doctors' best efforts.

He said he and his wife Amber ""made the decision to say our last goodbyes and donate his organs so that other children will be given a second chance at life"".

Smith continued: ""Riv was special. Everyone that met him knew that immediately. The joy he brought to our lives cannot be expressed and his light will be forever in our hearts.

""If there are words to say more, I cannot find them in this moment. Love the ones close to you. There has never been a more difficult moment for us than this.""

He added the family was devastated and heartbroken, but took solace that River was with God, and asked that donations be made to Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas.

The singer, who is also father to son Lincoln Monarch, five, and daughter London, seven, shared a picture of himself embracing a smiling River Kelly.

His wife Amber also shared a similarly-written post with a picture of herself holding River, beginning the message with: ""Nothing can prepare a mother to deliver this kind of news.""

Smith, who was signed to a contract at the age of 19 in Nashville and has released nine studio albums, is understood to have cancelled his show for Thursday night.

Many figures in the music industry paid tribute to the family following the announcement, including country singer Kane Brown, who wrote: ""I'm here for you if you need anything at all bro just hit me up"".

Another country singer, Luke Bryan, posted in the comments: ""Many prayers. So sorry"", while fellow country star Maren Morris added: ""I am so, so sorry. Thinking of you and your family at this time"".","Granger Smith announced on social media that his son River Kelly, three, had died.

95,"Rihanna, Beyonce or Madonna? Forbes names world's richest female musician",Emily Mee,"Rihanna (L) came ahead of Madonna (C) and Beyonce

Rihanna is the richest female musician in the world, according to Forbes.

The Barbados-born singer has accumulated a fortune of about $600m (£472m), most of which comes from her fashion and makeup businesses.

Forbes said Rihanna's wealth exceeds that of other artists such as Madonna, worth about £448m, Celine Dion, worth £350m, and Beyonce, worth £314m.

The 31-year-old's makeup brand, Fenty Beauty, was launched in 2017 and quickly became a viral success, reportedly making $100m (about £78m) in its first 40 days.

The brand is co-owned by LVMH, the French luxury goods giant which is also behind Givenchy, Dior and Louis Vuitton.

Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, recently revealed she had moved to London to be closer to the team working on her next collaboration with LVMH, a Fenty fashion line.

The Work singer is set to become the first woman to set up a fashion label with the group, as well as the first black woman to head up a LVMH fashion house.

She will also become the first person to set up a label with the group since Christian LaCroix in 1987.

In a post on Instagram, she thanked the billionaire CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, writing: ""Big day for the culture. Thank you Mr Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH.""

As well as her career in music and cosmetics, Rihanna is also behind the Savage X Fenty lingerie line.

""Money is happening along the way, but I'm working out of what I love to do, what I'm passionate about,"" she said.

""Work will change when my life changes in the future but an amount of money is not going to stop that.""

The pop singer has sold more than 250m records since moving to the US in 2005 and has twice been named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

97,Chernobyl: The real-life heroes of nuclear disaster watch TV hit,Diana Magnay,"Vladimir Naumov and Andrey Nasonov, ex-miners from Tula, had not heard about the hit TV series Chernobyl when we called, but they had caught up by the time we reached them - at least on the episode which features them.

The series, a Sky Atlantic/HBO co-production, tells in traumatic detail the complex chain of events set off by the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant on 26 April 1986 - and the heroism and sacrifice of the liquidators sent in to try and contain the radioactive leak.

By the time the miners were drafted in, the first responders - the firefighters who would also be the first to die - had put the fire out.

But the molten core was in danger of melting through the concrete pad on which it sat and seeping into the water table, risking a potential 50 million lives.

Image: The men said the series seemed more like an American western drama

Four hundred miners from Donbas (where the war is now in eastern Ukraine) and Tula, 120 miles south of Moscow, were drafted in to install a heat exchanger beneath the reactor to try and cool the core.

Most came from Tula because the ground there was sandy, as it was in Chernobyl. One in four have since died of cancers or radiation-related disease.

Asked whether he ever questioned the sacrifices made, Mr Naumov said: ""Who else but us? Me and my fellow workers were brought up that way. Not that we went there to die, we went there to save lives.

""To save our families first and our country, of course. And in the long run it turned out that Europe was affected, and that higher radiation was registered in the Sahara desert and even in South America.""

The two men watched the episode again with us in high spirits. They roared with laughter at the one Soviet joke the miners tell.

They were appalled at the sight of miners drinking vodka straight after a shift, which they said would never have happened.

Harris: Chernobyl is still relevant today

And they are adamant they never worked naked, despite the searing heat, and were never threatened by soldiers with guns: ""This is like an American movie with cowboys!""

But they did like the way they are portrayed as talking tough to the party.

Image: Andrey Nasonov at the memorial to the liquidators in Tula

Miners held a special place in Soviet times. The coal they dug powered the Soviet economy. They worked hard, took pride in what they did and did not kowtow to Soviet bureaucrats.

""The job itself, working underground, doing hard labour, increases a person's sense of inner worth,"" Mr Nasonov said.

""There's already very little difference between life and death for us.

""We have always been braver at dealing with managers.""

Image: Vladimir Naumov says he and the other miners who worked at Chernobyl will be remembered as a result of the TV drama

The two men preferred the documentaries made over the years which tell the tale in their own words. They pointed to a Russian documentary called Under The Reactor, specifically about the miners.

They have been to France to tell schoolchildren about the work of the liquidators; they want to go to the UK too. But they are glad the series has brought attention to their work in a way they never could.

Image: The dead are buried in Chernobyl. Pic: Sky Atlantic/HBO

""I'll never forget the enthusiasm I saw there,"" Mr Naumov said.

""Two minutes to load the cart, drive it 150m, unload it, and drive it back.

""I have never seen anything like that since. I doubt I ever will, it's unlikely anyone will be able to do that again.""

The job was expected to take three months; it took them six weeks. But in the end, the molten core cooled of its own accord. The heat exchanger they installed was never turned on.

""It was the first time such a thing had happened,"" Mr Nasonov said.

""What if the floor had begun to melt and we had not done our job as we were supposed to? Then it would have been worse for everyone, not just for us. It is good that it was never needed.""

Image: Abandoned buildings in a ghost town near the power plant

Image: A newspaper clipping from 1987 after the incident

The Chernobyl miners' association in Tula is an office and small museum. School groups visit to see what the miners of their city did for them 33 years ago.

From a faded newspaper clipping of a group of handsome, grinning men, Mr Naumov picked out those who have since died from the effects of the radiation.

""Every time I am at a funeral and give a speech I say, 'he was such a great man, he did such a heroic deed that few people have done! And he did not live his life in vain!'

""I too have not lived in vain. And once I've left this world, I will be remembered too.""

Like most of the miners who've survived, he gave up drink and cigarettes years ago. Vladimir Naumov is a robust man. But he has tears in his eyes now.","Asked whether he ever questioned the sacrifices made, Mr Naumov said: ""Who else but us?

But the molten core was in danger of melting through the concrete pad on which it sat and seeping into the water table, risking a potential 50 million lives.

Four hundred miners from Donbas (where the war is now in eastern Ukraine) and Tula, 120 miles south of Moscow, were drafted in to install a heat exchanger beneath the reactor to try and cool the core.

Most came from Tula because the ground there was sandy, as it was in Chernobyl. One in four have since died of cancers or radiation-related disease.

Asked whether he ever questioned the sacrifices made, Mr Naumov said: ""Who else but us? Me and my fellow workers were brought up that way. Not that we went there to die, we went there to save lives.

""To save our families first and our country, of course. And in the long run it turned out that Europe was affected, and that higher radiation was registered in the Sahara desert and even in South America.""

The two men watched the episode again with us in high spirits. They roared with laughter at the one Soviet joke the miners tell.

They were appalled at the sight of miners drinking vodka straight after a shift, which they said would never have happened.

Harris: Chernobyl is still relevant today

And they are adamant they never worked naked, despite the searing heat, and were never threatened by soldiers with guns: ""This is like an American movie with cowboys!""

But they did like the way they are portrayed as talking tough to the party.

Miners held a special place in Soviet times. The coal they dug powered the Soviet economy. They worked hard, took pride in what they did and did not kowtow to Soviet bureaucrats.

""The job itself, working underground, doing hard labour, increases a person's sense of inner worth,"" Mr Nasonov said.

""There's already very little difference between life and death for us.

""We have always been braver at dealing with managers.""

The two men preferred the documentaries made over the years which tell the tale in their own words. They pointed to a Russian documentary called Under The Reactor, specifically about the miners.

They have been to France to tell schoolchildren about the work of the liquidators; they want to go to the UK too. But they are glad the series has brought attention to their work in a way they never could.

""I'll never forget the enthusiasm I saw there,"" Mr Naumov said.

""Two minutes to load the cart, drive it 150m, unload it, and drive it back.

""I have never seen anything like that since. I doubt I ever will, it's unlikely anyone will be able to do that again.""

The job was expected to take three months; it took them six weeks. But in the end, the molten core cooled of its own accord. The heat exchanger they installed was never turned on.

""It was the first time such a thing had happened,"" Mr Nasonov said.

""What if the floor had begun to melt and we had not done our job as we were supposed to? Then it would have been worse for everyone, not just for us. It is good that it was never needed.""

The Chernobyl miners' association in Tula is an office and small museum. School groups visit to see what the miners of their city did for them 33 years ago.

From a faded newspaper clipping of a group of handsome, grinning men, Mr Naumov picked out those who have since died from the effects of the radiation.

""Every time I am at a funeral and give a speech I say, 'he was such a great man, he did such a heroic deed that few people have done! And he did not live his life in vain!'

""I too have not lived in vain. And once I've left this world, I will be remembered too.""

Like most of the miners who've survived, he gave up drink and cigarettes years ago. Vladimir Naumov is a robust man. But he has tears in his eyes now.","Asked whether he ever questioned the sacrifices made, Mr Naumov said: ""Who else but us?

99,James Bond crew member injured after explosion filmed at Pinewood Studios,David Mercer,"The next Bond film will be Daniel Craig's fifth outing as 007

A crew member working on the new James Bond film has been hurt during the filming of an explosion.

The blast damaged the outside of the famous 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, where the spy franchise is produced.

The makers of the film - which has been plagued by problems - said no one was injured on set but a crew member outside the stage suffered ""a minor injury"".

According to the Sun, the film crew were testing a stunt involving a fireball in a laboratory when the explosion took off part of the complex's roof and at least five wall panels.

The injured crew member was crushed by part of the set which fell on him, the newspaper said.

A tweet from the official James Bond account said: ""During the filming of a controlled explosion on the set of Bond 25 today at Pinewood Studios, damage was caused to the exterior of the 007 Stage.

""There were no injuries on set, however one crew member outside the stage has sustained a minor injury.""

The film's makers said at the time that production would continue while Craig was ""rehabilitating for two weeks post-surgery"".

The 25th Bond instalment - directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga - will be Craig's fifth outing as 007, with Oscar-winner Rami Malek set to play the film's villain.

101,Killdren: Band dropped from Glastonbury over 'Kill Tory Scum' lyrics,Russell Hope,"The Shangri-La area of the Glastonbury festival in 2014

A band with a song entitled Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You) has been dropped from this year's Glastonbury music festival.

Killdren, who describe themselves as ""a two-bit rave punk band who pen politically charged slapstick anthems"", had been booked to play the Shangri-La section of the festival.

They were due to perform at Glastonbury's Shangri-Hell International TV stage on Friday 28 June.

But the booking, which was revealed in several Sunday newspapers, was quickly condemned by, among others, the Jo Cox Foundation, which called the language ""completely abhorrent"".

""We're seeing a legitimising and normalising of harmful words and actions,"" it said.

The song's lyrics include the lines: ""Even if it's your dad or your mum, kill Tory scum, kill Tory scum... murder them all to the beat of a drum, kill Tory scum, kill Tory scum.""

A message at the end of the song's video makes it clear, however, that Killdren ""do not condone the killing of MPs or voters"".

It adds that Tories should be murdered... ""at the ballot box... OBVIOUSLY"".

The booking was cancelled on Sunday evening by organisers, who said in a tweet: ""We are incredibly saddened that the attention this booking has received has caused such upset and negativity... as a result we have taken the decision to withdraw the booking of this band.""

Earlier, the band had appeared to be revelling in their new-found notoriety, tweeting that it had helped them sell merchandise.

They later asked Twitter followers to ""give the video a watch for facts about the real violence in society inflicted by Tory policies....!!""

The decision to rescind the band's booking received a negative reaction on social media.

Trump UK state visit: President will be desperate for 'pomp and pageantry' to play well at home

Donald Trump met the Queen when he visited the UK last summer

Before it has even begun, Donald Trump has built an epic storyline around his UK state visit.

He rarely leaves Washington without making waves and seemingly didn't want to pass up on the opportunity this time either.

Just like his previous visit, the president decided to lob a few political hand grenades before arrival, offering his views on how Britain should handle Brexit and heaping praise on his friends Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson rather than focusing on the prime minister who he's about to meet again.

But she is the lamest of lame duck prime ministers and he's a man who doesn't like to miss a chance to catch up with politicians he thinks share his language and views (even if in the case of Mr Johnson they've taken a bit of a u-turn).

The president was never going to let himself be strangled by the constraints of conventional diplomacy. But dare I say it, there is a very real chance it will all be a lot more formal and and formulaic from here on in. State visits are predominantly royal affairs, more ceremonial than political.

Mr Trump will love the pomp and pageantry and as a man with an obsessive eye on optics, he will desperately want the visuals to play well at home, especially with a re-election race around the corner.

Image: Mr Trump will meet the PM in her final days as Tory leader

There is little incentive for him to make a mess of it either.

He has a fondness for Britain, his Scottish mother loved the Queen and he's brought his adult children along for the ride.

Don't underestimate how much he'll delight in the occasion of it all. A state visit has the ability to leave its guests awe-struck.

Of course there is some so-called ""executive time"" baked in and a dinner where he gets to choose the guests. That has the potential to provide an uncomfortable sideshow.

Trump looking forward to 'fully independent Britain'

There are the policy divides too - differing views on how to respond to Iranian aggression and America hasn't taken kindly to the idea British ministers will allow the telecoms giant Huawei to build part of the UK's 5G mobile network.

But with such a packed schedule at such a fragile political time and a governing party stuck in a myopic leadership battle, it's hard to imagine they'll have the time to argue over substantive foreign policy. But who knows? A tweet can go a long way…

The Trump administration does want to work on a deal with Britain though.

In an exclusive interview last week, President Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton told me that the president is ""looking forward to a day the US and the UK can negotiate a bilateral agreement that will be beneficial to both countries"".

In recent months, the White House has been consistently positive, viewing a UK-US trade agreement as a priority with great prospects.

The president is enjoying the highest approval rating in two years. Both sides want this visit to work.

Britain is in the middle of an extremely delicate moment and the government knows it needs to keep and improve its relationships outside of Europe.

America, and yes, Mr Trump, will be key to that.","Trump UK state visit: President will be desperate for 'pomp and pageantry' to play well at homeTrump UK state visit: President will be desperate for 'pomp and pageantry' to play well at homeDonald Trump met the Queen when he visited the UK last summerBefore it has even begun, Donald Trump has built an epic storyline around his UK state visit.

105,Donald Trump's UK state visit: Five things we learned,Cordelia Lynch,"Charles and the Queen appear to share a joke with Donald Trump

US President Donald Trump returned to the UK earlier this week for a full-blown state visit. Here are five things we learned from his three-day stay.

Trump can be humble

President Trump is a bombast showman. He revels in the spotlight and thrives on outrage.

But he seemed genuinely humbled in the presence of the Queen.

Image: The Queen was joined by Donald Trump at the Buckingham Palace state banquet

He's made no secret of course about his penchant for pomp and pageantry. But this went deeper.

He was more attentive, dignified and disciplined than we've ever seen him. For once, it wasn't all about Trump.

Shock drop

The mercurial president has the ability to whip up global indignation at the drop of a tweet.

Britain has been at the sharp end of that. He's previously criticised Theresa May's handling of Brexit, accused GCHQ of spying on his election campaign and described Muslim ""no go zones"" in London.

Image: Donald Trump and Theresa May attend a joint news conference at the Foreign Office

This time, he decided to embark on his much anticipated state visit by calling the city's mayor as ""stone cold loser"", crossing a diplomatic line before he'd even stepped off the plane.

At a press conference he suggested the NHS may be up for grabs in a trade deal and discussed successors to Mrs May as much as the PM herself.

And yet, once Monday's tweet grenade was fired, he generated comparatively little controversy and graciously praised Mrs May.

Are we becoming numb to the side-show dramas? I don't think so.

Image: Theresa May and Donald Trump share a joke outside No10

But there's a predictable arch about the way Mr Trump works and travels that we've become accustomed to. The reality of what the freewheeling politician suggests and his actual policies are often poles apart.

Royal power

The Queen played host to a man few know how to handle.

There were countless mines to step over and sky-high potential for embarrassment. But their three days of events went largely without a hitch.

Of-course Queen Elizabeth is an unblemished professional when it comes to exercising diplomacy and discretion.

Image: Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Queen Elizabeth, the Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace

But Mr Trump is a man who will have kept mandarins and courtiers up at night in the run-up. They needn't have worried.

And the Queen still managed to make a point amidst all the pomp, too. Only she could have got away with using her banquet speech to deliver a firm message about the importance of the post-war international institutions that Mr Trump distrusts.

:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

He wants to pick Britain's next leader

Gove, Johnson, Hunt. The president had something to say about all of them - even if in Michael Gove's case he claimed not to remember him.

He did of course sit down with him for an interview but hey, it's been a busy presidency. The fact is, relationships are everything to Mr Trump.

Michael Gove remains silent when challenged about Donald Trump not knowing him.

He rarely passes up the chance to talk with like-minded politicians and he delights in the prospect of playing king maker.

His comments may prove utterly irrelevant to votes, but after a rocky time with Mrs May and a trade deal to negotiate, he clearly wants someone he knows he can do business with.

Trump is on a learning curve

At the joint news conference with Mrs May, Mr Trump appeared unsure about what the NHS was - shortly before suggesting it could be part of a future deal.

He seemed confused about exactly who Jeremy Corbyn was, too. And in Ireland, he appeared to think the prime minister Leo Varadkar wanted a wall along the border.

Of-course Queen Elizabeth is an unblemished professional when it comes to exercising diplomacy and discretion.

But Mr Trump is a man who will have kept mandarins and courtiers up at night in the run-up. They needn't have worried.

And the Queen still managed to make a point amidst all the pomp, too. Only she could have got away with using her banquet speech to deliver a firm message about the importance of the post-war international institutions that Mr Trump distrusts.

He wants to pick Britain's next leader

Gove, Johnson, Hunt. The president had something to say about all of them - even if in Michael Gove's case he claimed not to remember him.

He did of course sit down with him for an interview but hey, it's been a busy presidency. The fact is, relationships are everything to Mr Trump.

Michael Gove remains silent when challenged about Donald Trump not knowing him.

He rarely passes up the chance to talk with like-minded politicians and he delights in the prospect of playing king maker.

His comments may prove utterly irrelevant to votes, but after a rocky time with Mrs May and a trade deal to negotiate, he clearly wants someone he knows he can do business with.

Trump is on a learning curve

At the joint news conference with Mrs May, Mr Trump appeared unsure about what the NHS was - shortly before suggesting it could be part of a future deal.

He seemed confused about exactly who Jeremy Corbyn was, too. And in Ireland, he appeared to think the prime minister Leo Varadkar wanted a wall along the border.

Baby on board! Woman gives birth in the back of an Uber

""Helped me give birth"" is not one of the feedback options available after a passenger finishes a ride in an Uber - but perhaps it should be.

Uber driver Krunal Shukla, originally from Gujarat, India, had a surprise extra passenger when he picked up a heavily pregnant woman, her father and younger sister from a home in east London with their destination set as St Thomas' Hospital.

After just a few minutes in the car, Ada Luguterah realised her baby was not going to wait.

""We thought we had time but a few minutes later it was contractions and the baby was coming straight away,"" Mrs Luguterah told Sky News.

The baby's mother explained: ""[The driver] had to call the ambulance and my sister had to catch the baby in the back seat of the Uber!""

Laughing, she added: ""At the time same time, we were worrying about the fact that we were going to mess the car up.""

Mr Shukla took control of the situation, pulling over in Amersham Road, New Cross, at around 1.30am on Friday morning and calling for an ambulance.

In the few minutes the ambulance took to get there, Mr Shukla's fourth passenger had already arrived.

Praising the Uber driver, Mrs Luguterah said he was ""so supportive"" and ""really good"", adding that ""he made the whole thing so much easier"".

Mr Shukla told Sky News if he knew she was so close to giving birth he would have ensured she had taken an ambulance rather than his taxi.

""I thought it was just for a routine check-up,"" he said, but explained that after a few minutes his passenger began to shout ""the baby is coming now!""

""I was so shocked,"" he said.

Mrs Luguterah, 34, who also has a four-year-old son, said: ""That was the last thing I ever thought in my life that was going to happen. Things like that happen in the movies, in One Born Every Minute [a TV show about a maternity hospital], but it doesn't happen to normal humans like us!""

The baby boy does not have a name yet, but one of Mrs Luguterah's siblings suggested he be called Uber.

The baby came more than a week early and Mrs Luguterah had not been expecting to give birth that night, saying she had gone to work at the bank as usual, come home and gone to sleep before the baby decided to come early.

She was with her father and younger sister in the car, but wishes her mother had been with them, saying: ""Mum would have had experience and known what to do. Dad has never had the privilege to be there with his children [when they were born]… and my sister has never seen a child being born until she had to catch one for the first time.

Image: The Uber driver was given a five-star rating by his unusual passenger

""It was a good quick lesson for everyone involved, including the poor Uber driver. Oh my gosh, he was the sane one among everyone. He was never thinking about his car at all.""

Mr Shukla helped direct the ambulance to them and followed the instructions down the phone to try to help, including trying to find blankets.

The Uber driver did not have any - but resourcefully remembered he had some brand new cotton clothes in his boot from a £1 shop that he was intending to use to clean his car. He also put the heater on to keep the baby warm when he arrived.

He said: ""I was worried for them and then suddenly I can see the baby come!""

Reflecting on the unusual events, Mr Shukla said: ""I think there is a message for the whole world. There is a lot of bad but… look at this woman… we must respect our mothers.""

Speaking of his role, he said simply: ""It was my duty as a human. She is a brave mum.""

The pair spoke later on Friday, with the mother thanking the driver for his help and promising to get back in touch in a few months time to let him know how the family are getting on.

And, if you're wondering, Mrs Luguterah gave Mr Shukla a five-star rating on the app - and Uber waived the cleaning fee for the back seat.

An Uber spokesperson said: ""We are delighted that Ada and her baby are doing well. Krunal remained calm under pressure throughout the journey.

""Uber is proud to play a small part in helping this new family when they needed a quick, safe and reliable ride the most.""","Woman gives birth in the back of an UberBaby on board!

111,"Bat hidden in iPad case bites pensioner's finger, leaving him with rabies",Lucia Binding,"The bat had been hiding inbetween an iPad and its case

An 86-year-old man is being treated for rabies after being bitten by a bat wedged between the back of his iPad and its case.

Roy Syvertson, from New Hampshire in the US, told WMUR-TV that he had been using the tablet for about an hour before the creature popped its head out and nipped him.

The pensioner said it felt like a bee sting at first, adding: ""I looked, and the bat was coming out of here, between the cover and the back of the pad.""

""And then I got up, still squeezing it, which I'm sure he wasn't happy about, and I took him outside.""

Image: Roy Syvertson had been using the tablet for an hour before realising he had been bitten

The next morning, Mr Syvertson said the bat was still there and alive, but he later discovered that it died later that night.

""Then I knew I might have a problem,"" Mr Syvertson said.

Image: The rabid bat popped its head out and nipped Mr Syvertson

Concerned the bat might be infected with rabies, he called the New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game.

He was instructed to go to hospital to be immediately tested, and it later turned out that the bat was rabid.

Doctors told Mr Syvertson that he will be fine, though it remains a mystery how the bat got into his house and into the iPad case.

""It will remain a mystery, and my joke of, 'He probably knew my password' won't last forever. That won't be funny for a long time,"" Mr Syvertson said.

Image: Roy Syvertson had been using the tablet for an hour before realising he had been bitten

If left untreated, rabies can lead to brain disease and death as the virus attacks the central nervous system.

Early symptoms include fever, headache, weakness and discomfort, and the disease can also cause hallucinations and difficulty swallowing.

All mammals can carry rabies, but it is most common in dogs, bats, raccoons and foxes.

According to the NHS, post-exposure treatment involves cleaning and disinfecting the wound, a course of the rabies vaccine and in some cases, a medicine called immunoglobulin.","The bat had been hiding inbetween an iPad and its caseAn 86-year-old man is being treated for rabies after being bitten by a bat wedged between the back of his iPad and its case.

Farmer saws off his own leg with pocket knife after becoming stuck in machinery

Kurt Kaser had to saw off his own leg after he became stuck in a piece of machinery, but is determined to 'make the best of it'.

A farmer had to saw off his own leg with a pocket knife after he became stuck in a piece of machinery.

Kurt Kaser, from Nebraska, was unloading corn before he climbed out of his truck and accidentally stepped on the opening of a grain auger.

The equipment is used to transport grain and has a part inside resembling a large drill-bit.

Mr Kaser said he became caught as the device pulled at his leg, tearing away skin, muscle and tissue.

The farmer, who lives in the village of Pender, told ABC News: ""I stepped right in the damn thing. It grabbed hold of me.

""I can remember seeing it start and I go, 'this ain't good'.

""And then when my foot was in the there banging around, I was trying to hold my leg, pulling it out, and I said, 'This is not good'.""

Mr Kaser, who didn't have his mobile with him, said there was no one around to help and he didn't know if somebody would come.

He also feared he might pass out as the machine pulled on his leg.

Mr Kaser continued: ""I about gave up and said, 'Whatever happens happens. If it sucks me in all the way, it's over with'.

""But then, all at once, I thought of my pocket knife.""

The farmer said at one point he nearly dropped the three to four-inch blade into the auger, but once he had a good grip he started sawing off his leg about eight inches below the knee.

Mr Kaser said he doesn't remember experiencing much pain and he didn't notice a lot of blood.

He continued: ""Adrenaline kicked in so much that I don't know if it hurt or not.""

Once he had amputated his own leg Mr Kaser had to crawl about 150 to 200 feet on rock and gravel to the nearest phone.

He then contacted one of his sons who relayed the emergency to 911.

A medical helicopter arrived and flew him to a trauma centre about 90 miles away in Lincoln.

Farmer saws off his own leg with pocket knife after becoming stuck in machinery

Kurt Kaser had to saw off his own leg after he became stuck in a piece of machinery, but is determined to 'make the best of it'.

A farmer had to saw off his own leg with a pocket knife after he became stuck in a piece of machinery.

Kurt Kaser, from Nebraska, was unloading corn before he climbed out of his truck and accidentally stepped on the opening of a grain auger.

The equipment is used to transport grain and has a part inside resembling a large drill-bit.

Mr Kaser said he became caught as the device pulled at his leg, tearing away skin, muscle and tissue.

The farmer, who lives in the village of Pender, told ABC News: ""I stepped right in the damn thing. It grabbed hold of me.

""I can remember seeing it start and I go, 'this ain't good'.

""And then when my foot was in the there banging around, I was trying to hold my leg, pulling it out, and I said, 'This is not good'.""

Mr Kaser, who didn't have his mobile with him, said there was no one around to help and he didn't know if somebody would come.

He also feared he might pass out as the machine pulled on his leg.

Mr Kaser continued: ""I about gave up and said, 'Whatever happens happens. If it sucks me in all the way, it's over with'.

""But then, all at once, I thought of my pocket knife.""

The farmer said at one point he nearly dropped the three to four-inch blade into the auger, but once he had a good grip he started sawing off his leg about eight inches below the knee.

Mr Kaser said he doesn't remember experiencing much pain and he didn't notice a lot of blood.

He continued: ""Adrenaline kicked in so much that I don't know if it hurt or not.""

Once he had amputated his own leg Mr Kaser had to crawl about 150 to 200 feet on rock and gravel to the nearest phone.

He then contacted one of his sons who relayed the emergency to 911.

A medical helicopter arrived and flew him to a trauma centre about 90 miles away in Lincoln.

He was released from a rehabilitation centre on Friday, but will have to wait for his amputated leg to heal before getting a prosthetic limb.

Mr Kaser admitted that he had cut away part of the auger's safety screen to make it fit into a space last winter.

115,South Western Rail investigating after worker 'broadcasts porn' to giggling passengers,Ajay Nair,"South Western Railway has apologised for the incident

Commuters were left bemused after what sounded like audio from a pornographic film was broadcast on a train's loudspeaker system.

In a video posted on Twitter, passenger Paul Brunton captured the moment giggling travellers were forced to listen to the sexual sounds on their journey.

It appeared as if a South Western Railway employee had accessed the X-rated material while a microphone was live, accidentally broadcasting it to the unsuspecting commuters.

Posting the footage, Mr Brunton wrote: ""My tube driver casually watching porn whilst leaving the tannoy system on...""

One woman in the video is heard asking: ""Is that coming from the driver?""

Amid the confusion, another answers: ""No, it's someone's phone.""

Transport for London responded to the clip on Twitter, saying: ""Oh dear 😳🙈 Thankfully not one of our trains or drivers 😂""

The video, which has received almost 800,000 views, attracted hundreds of comments from amused social media users responding with puns and innuendos.

""At least someone's enjoying the commute to work,"" wrote one, while another added: ""The grade school giggles are cracking me up.""

A South Western Railway spokesperson apologised for the incident and said the operator was investigating.

Royal Mail is investigating fake stamps featuring Diane Abbott's face which are apparently making their way through the postal network.

An anonymous man claiming to be a London postman shared images of the red stamps - one of which was franked - with several news outlets.

It comes after Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, became an internet sensation after she was seen sipping a canned mojito on a London tube train last month.

119,Explained: Einstein's theory of general relativity,Alexander J Martin,"Today marks the centenary of an experiment which proved Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity - but what exactly is that theory?

Dr Matthew Bothwell, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge, spoke to Sky News to explain how the theory works and why it's important.

""I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Einstein's general theory of relativity completely revolutionised our understanding of the universe. Nothing about modern cosmology can be understood without the context of Einstein's theories,"" Dr Bothwell added.

Thanks to the experiment 100 years ago today, space itself was no longer thought of as the geometric plane suggested by classical mechanics as formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, thought of like a table necessary to roll a ball over.

Instead, according to Einstein's theory, space and time were the same thing - a single construct which could be called spacetime.

Gravity was now understood to be a force altering the geometric structure of spacetime itself.

Professor Mike Cruise, resident of the Royal Astronomical Society, said: ""A century ago astronomers confirmed the general theory of relativity - in the process transforming our understanding of the universe for ever.

121,"Google's Chrome browser plans 'risk undermining fight against online child abuse', govt warned",Alexander J Martin,"A planned change to the Chrome web browser by Google would have a ""catastrophic impact on victims of online child sexual abuse"" by undermining internet filters in the UK, the government has been warned.

Techniques used to prevent images of child abuse being spread online would be made ""obsolete"" unless the government takes action, according to a parliamentary briefing note obtained by Sky News.

The briefing, written by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - a charity with the task of finding and removing child abuse images online - says its ""crucial service"" of filtering URLs is now at risk.

Image: The IWF describes the changes as 'catastrophic'

The government has faced months of warnings related to the changes, due in future releases of Google's Chrome browser and Mozilla Firefox, but is yet to address them.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have warned that the changes, despite being designed to protect users, would critically undermine tools used to block people from accessing abuse websites.

The IWF provides ISPs with a list of up to 12,000 web pages which hold child abuse material so that the ISPs can filter access to those pages while authorities try to take them down.

But browser companies argue that the mechanism this anti-abuse filter uses could be exploited by criminals and hackers and they are trying to fix the technical issue.

Chrome is the most widely used web browser in the UK, with almost 50% of the entire market share according to StatCounter, while roughly 5% of Brits browse over Firefox.

The IWF are concerned that the changes to both browsers could ruin years of work tackling child abuse images by allowing the public to access them at an enormous scale.

Image: Sky News obtained a parliamentary briefing note regarding the changes

Fred Langford, the head of the IWF, warned: ""If [the technology was] the default position on browsers used by the majority of people in the UK, it would make the kind of images we've spent all these years blocking suddenly highly accessible.""

A spokesperson for the ISPA trade association which supports ISPs told Sky News: ""Serious changes need to be made to [the new technology] for it to be even near fit for purpose in the UK.

""Until that happens the government needs to send a strong message to browsers such as Mozilla and Google that these changes cannot go ahead.""

A government spokesperson said: ""Whilst we look to support capabilities that seek to deliver security and privacy to the UK online, we are concerned about unintended consequences changes could have.

""We will work with industry and regulators to seek solutions to any potential problems as part of our ongoing work to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online.""

Image: Mozilla said DNS-based filters were already broken

A spokesperson for Mozilla told Sky News that the technology wouldn't ""truly change the state"" of how the content restrictions work, which they said had been ineffective for over a decade.

However they added that they ""always honour user choice"" and that Firefox would make it possible for people to manually configure their settings so that they were bound to the ISP restrictions.

""We will also disable the feature automatically within companies, libraries, schools and other organisations that have managed networks or custom DNS settings,"" Mozilla added.

In its statement, Google said it was ""always looking for ways to enhance privacy and protect users from online threats"" and was currently ""exploring additional ways to provide secure connections"".

""Contrary to reports, these secure connections would not disable the existing content controls of your current provider, including any existing protections for children,"" the company said.

123,Queen's personal connection to wartime generation makes poignant tribute,Rhiannon Mills,"The day was poignant for the Queen and her wartime generation

This was always going to be a poignant day for the Queen.

Taking pride of place, surrounded by over a dozen heads of state and prime ministers at the commemorative event on Southsea Common, where thousands of men gathered 75 years ago ready to embark on the D-Day landings with no guarantee that they would come home.

Her Majesty is joined by 15 world leaders to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

Her Majesty is the only one of those world leaders who remembers first hand the enormity of the bravery and sacrifice of those who were sent to the beaches in Normandy.

Princess Elizabeth was 18 at the time. Reminding the audience of her own personal connection she recalled a speech that her father King George VI gave at the time in which he said: ""What is demanded from us all is something more than courage and endurance; we need a revival of spirit, a new unconquerable resolve...""

Image: The Queen and Donald Trump at the event in Portsmouth

Seven decades on the Queen added to her father's tribute, saying: ""That is exactly what those brave men brought to the battle, as the fate of the world depended on their success. Many of them would never return, and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten.

""It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country - indeed the whole free world - that I say to you all, thank you.""

But she was also speaking up for her generation. The no nonsense humility displayed by many of the veterans, echoed in her own words, as she said: ""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day Landings, some thought it might be the last such event.

""But the wartime generation - my generation - is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today.""

It has been a week when the monarch has displayed her own dedication to her country as she, more than anyone else, set the tone for Donald Trump's state visit.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Again in Portsmouth sitting alongside her, the president was in his element, oozing an air of deference and respect. It's hard to think of any other world leader that could have the same effect on this outspoken president.

Yes there has been controversy over Trump's comments about the NHS, Jeremy Corbyn, Sadiq Khan, who will replace Theresa May, and even what he thinks about the Duchess of Sussex, but he has appeared toned down in his approach.

Whatever you think of the Royal family, the Queen, supported by her relatives has helped to maintain a display of business as usual, against a backdrop of considerable political uncertainty.

A week where the 93-year-old sovereign has shown her own personal resilience and stamina in abundance.","The day was poignant for the Queen and her wartime generationThis was always going to be a poignant day for the Queen.

Her Majesty is joined by 15 world leaders to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

Her Majesty is the only one of those world leaders who remembers first hand the enormity of the bravery and sacrifice of those who were sent to the beaches in Normandy.

Princess Elizabeth was 18 at the time. Reminding the audience of her own personal connection she recalled a speech that her father King George VI gave at the time in which he said: ""What is demanded from us all is something more than courage and endurance; we need a revival of spirit, a new unconquerable resolve...""

Seven decades on the Queen added to her father's tribute, saying: ""That is exactly what those brave men brought to the battle, as the fate of the world depended on their success. Many of them would never return, and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten.

""It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country - indeed the whole free world - that I say to you all, thank you.""

But she was also speaking up for her generation. The no nonsense humility displayed by many of the veterans, echoed in her own words, as she said: ""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day Landings, some thought it might be the last such event.

""But the wartime generation - my generation - is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today.""

It has been a week when the monarch has displayed her own dedication to her country as she, more than anyone else, set the tone for Donald Trump's state visit.

Again in Portsmouth sitting alongside her, the president was in his element, oozing an air of deference and respect. It's hard to think of any other world leader that could have the same effect on this outspoken president.

Yes there has been controversy over Trump's comments about the NHS, Jeremy Corbyn, Sadiq Khan, who will replace Theresa May, and even what he thinks about the Duchess of Sussex, but he has appeared toned down in his approach.

Whatever you think of the Royal family, the Queen, supported by her relatives has helped to maintain a display of business as usual, against a backdrop of considerable political uncertainty.

A week where the 93-year-old sovereign has shown her own personal resilience and stamina in abundance.","The day was poignant for the Queen and her wartime generationThis was always going to be a poignant day for the Queen.

125,Trump state visit: More a lavish holiday than business trip?,Jason Farrell,"President Trump inspecting an honour guard during his welcome ceremony at Buckingham Palace

Is this just a lavish holiday for Mr Trump?

At last night's banquet at Buckingham Palace the special relationship was gilded in pageantry, but today the cracks may quickly reappear, as a divisive president continues to tread, not too carefully, into fragile British politics.

His exchange of insults with London Mayor Sadiq Khan has already set the tone for his relationship with the Labour party. Trump tweeted that the mayor was a ""stone cold loser"".

Today, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will give his view of the president - and the fact that he's is giving it at a rally of protesters, campaigning against the presidential visit gives you an indication of what he might say.

Stephen Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, summed up the mood of many opposition MPs. He told Sky News: ""The prime minister should never have offered this to president Trump.

""He's clearly shown that he's unwilling to play by the normal standards of diplomacy when it comes to the mayor of London and I think it's hugely ill-judged.

""I think we will regret having him here. I think it's a week of shame for Britain that he's actually come here and been given this red-carpet treatment.""

Against this backdrop Mr Trump and Theresa May will be trying to do business - meeting with senior UK and US business leaders. Trade will be top of the agenda.

Mr Trump says the UK needs to slip its EU ""shackles"" for a US trade deal, but with Britain in a state of flux over Brexit it's hard to see where any progress can be made.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

On Monday night the president tweeted: ""London part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal Family have been fantastic.

""The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong. Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our country.

""Haven't seen any protests yet, but I'm sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around.

""Also, big Trade Deal is possible once UK gets rid of the shackles. Already starting to talk!""

Controversially, US ambassador Woody Johnson indicated the US will want access to the NHS business in any post-Brexit trade deal.

This adds to concerns that the UK may be obliged to accept chlorinated poultry as part of any trade deal. But business leaders believe progress can be made.

Ben Digby, international director at the CBI said: ""Free trade agreements always take a number of years. I think we've had some experience of that in the last couple of years in the Brexit negotiations - but there are a few things that we could be getting on with immediately to facilitate trade between both countries.

""I'd look at people - the visa system. Let's look at making it a bit easier for people to travel and do business in each country.""

After meeting business leaders the president will visit 10 Downing Street for lunch. Mrs May is set to raise the issue of climate change.

A spokesman said ""As the prime minister has said previously, we were disappointed by the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017 and continue to hope they will return.""



Donald Trump will raise security concerns about the UK allowing Chinese technology firm Huawei to build parts of its 5G wireless networks.

Some of her own MPs agree with him. Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky News: ""I'm concerned about the relationship with Huawei - I think even if there is a slight risk the security of the nation must come first and I happen to think what the president has been saying is sensible advice.""

But is there much point the president raising this with an out-going prime minister?

The truth is this isn't the state visit it was supposed to be. Instead of a post-Brexit Britain ready to do business, Mr Trump has arrived in a politically divided country where Brexit remains unresolved and the prime minster is about to leave office.

The timing is bad. The big deals can't be done. Diplomatic initiatives will be hampered by the absence of anyone in charge.

It's hard to see this as much more than a lavish holiday for Mr Trump.

The president has made no secret he might meet his favourite to be the next prime minister - Boris Johnson. Will he also do more to promote Nigel Farage?

127,"In the Tories' darkest hour, they need a Churchill",Lewis Goodall,"It's the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Perhaps that's why Winston Churchill is on my mind.

A quote of his, rattling around my brain for days, not, in this case about those famous Normandy beaches but about the British skies.

Eighty years after he said it, there's another battle of Britain going on, this time for the soul of Churchill's party and a bastardisation of that famous quote, seems apposite right now. For as I survey the state of the Tory leadership race and ergo, for our next prime minister, I can only conclude that never in the field of political conflict were so many candidates found so wanting, so many, with so much to say, to so little effect.

The sheer number of putative prime ministers in this battle only illustrates how poor the state of the Conservative Party is and by extension, how gloomy the prospects for this country's politics are.

Let us start with the number of candidates itself. Never have we seen so many wannabes for the leadership of a major party, normally there are half a dozen at the very most.

Some have said that this is a good thing - let a thousand flowers bloom, the cry goes. But far from this being a sign of health, of a plethora of talent on display, it is in fact the opposite, a nod to a party mired in ill-discipline and deep decay. It confirms the weakness of the front runners, those in the great offices of state.

Through political weight they should be able to command allegiance but they cannot.

So tainted or problematic are they that their power within the party to cajole, to force the smallest of minnows to get in line, is far more limited than it ought to be. A problem only compounded by their failure to offer little in the way of compelling vision around which to cohere.

Likewise, it speaks to the fact that the factions of the Tory party have become so inchoate, so divided unto themselves, that they can't each produce a single standard bearer around which to rally. Civil war within the factions producing yet greater civil war overall; it is a mess.

:: Listen to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

All that is left then is the only thing which is in plentiful supply in this contest, the ambition of the individuals themselves.

In this context, even the lowliest junior minister appraises the field and thinks: ""yes, why not me too?""

The surfeit of candidates and the weakness of the front runners would be more acceptable and even elevating if they all had something new to say, some new plans to proffer, some answer to the Brexit riddle.

And yet so far, answers of any credibility are few and far between. Instead, there are the same strategies reheated, the same dead-end solutions all at one time or other attempted by Mrs May and discarded; each metaphorical bodies which lined the road to the end of her premiership.

Sam Gyimah promises true conservatism

Save for Sam Gyimah, whose idea for a three-way referendum (including no deal) is the only thing which I've seen which might get a majority, much else is either Mayism with twists or the same old ideas which don't have a hope.

The cardinal problem is thus: every candidate who favours a deal has not explained how they get there without a referendum (save for Gyimah) or a renegotiation which won't work. Every no-dealer has failed to offer a solution which explains how you get to no deal without an election, given parliament will not accept it.

To go through all 13 of the plans (or by the time you read this, 14, 15, 16…?) would expend too much of your energies and mine but to take but a few: there was much excitement about Matt Hancock's plan in the Sunday Times, many hailed it as ""honest"" and ""straightforward"" - indeed, it was honest about his distaste for a no deal and how otiose it is to pretend it has utility as a negotiating strategy.

However, when it came to solutions to actually passing a deal, it clung to the same chimeras: a time limit on the backstop (the Irish will never accept), technological solutions on the border (equally unacceptable to the EU and unavailable til 2030) and a free-trade agreement (which May was asking for anyway).

Even more outlandish (bizarre?) was Andrea Leadsom's intervention.

:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

She is arguing for a ""managed exit"". She implied parliament could unilaterally solve many of the inevitable problems which would come with no deal by simply legislating for them.

We could legislate for customs, for British citizens abroad, for the Irish border - at no point apparently considering the fact that the EU would have to cooperate on all these matters, that that's precisely what a deal is supposed to achieve and the British parliament, as grand and as sovereign as it might be, is not an island, it has no power to legislate for the French parliament or the Spanish, or the German.

They might as well legislate for every day in December to be sunny - it just can't do it.

Suffering from ISP (Island Parliament Syndrome) too is Kit Malthouse, parroting his achievement of brokering a compromise which almost no-one supported; critically, most of all the EU, who are the side which would have to compromise to accept it.

Graham Brady too, trumpeting his eponymous amendment which he says is the only thing to have got a majority, despite the fact it was a majority for something completely unobtainable (more December sunshine).

And then there's Esther McVey who actively argues for no deal, despite the fact we would effectively be ripping up the Good Friday Agreement, with all the consequences therein, barely mentioned, barely thought about by no deal's advocates.

Image: Rory Stewart: the Marco Polo of Brexit?

This thoughtlessness on Ireland is not confined to the no-dealers: Sajid Javid argued on Sunday that Ireland was ""the tail wagging the dog"", parading once more the cardinal sin against which this generation of Tories will be charged with regards to Brexit: their lack of understanding that their project is not fundamentally a question of our relations with the EU, so much as our relationship with Ireland.

Ireland is the dog, Europe is the tail. It is an Irish question, not a European one, the perennial question of British politics. Until that question can be solved satisfactorily - and Tories properly engage with it and devise an answer - there can be no Brexit.

The sole highlight seems to have been Rory Stewart, wandering around the UK, playing the role of eccentric merchant adventurer, the Marco Polo of Brexit. Charming, perhaps - but the substance of his policy remains May's deal, which without an election to swell Tory numbers (an election he's said he will not call) is yet another dead end.

And so, in this chaos, the front runners have chosen to… well say very little. Boris Johnson has clearly recognised he's the biggest potential liability to his own campaign and he's best off saying nothing.

Michael Gove has been relatively tight lipped too. Jeremy Hunt has apparently been in favour of all the solutions at one point or another, so decided to go to Edinburgh to launch his campaign video next to a statue of Adam Smith, claiming that Smith was the sort of thing the union could achieve, so long as we work together.

Though admirably esoteric, I'm not sure the idea of more Scottish enlightenment philosophers is much of a winning campaign strategy (nor can Smith fairly be described as a collaborative project) but, it was, at least, an original take.

Image: Boris Johnson's tactic appears to be to keep quiet

Do not waste this time, Donald Tusk implored. He will be disappointed. What became of the Conservative Party? The party of Churchill, Macmillan, Thatcher and those under them, the great ministers, Carrington, Butler, Macleod to name a few. A party which combined pragmatism, deep attachment to our parliamentary institutions and engagement with the world as it is, not as they might like it to be.

It is a question over which historians will linger long. In 2015, total hegemony was within their grasp. They had won a majority against the odds, Labour's response was to elect Jeremy Corbyn. A new, enduring political project was possible.

Instead, they used their moment of strength to indulge their greatest weaknesses. In four short years, they have converted the potential for another decade or more of government, to the precipice of destruction, the worst election results in their long and venerable history.

129,Woodford Investments: A sorry tale of bad bets,Ian King,"When Neil Woodford left the fund management giant Invesco Perpetual in October 2013 to set up his own company, he was without doubt Britain's most-garlanded asset manager.

At the time of his departure, he had £33bn under management, more than any other fund manager.

That reflected the faith that more than one million savers had put in him over the previous quarter century: the Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund, which he had run since 1988, had generated a return of 2,213% while the similar Income Fund had returned 1,839%.

That was way in excess of any industry benchmarks or comparable stock indices over the period.

The key to that performance was Mr Woodford's investment style.

This was a combination of buying and holding big ""defensive"" stocks in sectors like pharmaceuticals and tobacco - solid, reliable sectors that delivered a regular and predictable stream of dividends down the years.

He took big positions in such companies, too, with drugs majors Glaxosmithkline and AstraZeneca accounting for more than 17% of his two flagship funds when he left Invesco Perpetual.

Among his other core holdings were Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant and the tobacco manufacturers British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco (now called Imperial Brands) and Reynolds American (now part of BAT).

This earned him criticism during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s but the bets paid off when, after the bubble burst in March 2000, investors rediscovered their appetite for reliable sectors like tobacco.

Similarly, during the build-up to the financial crisis, Mr Woodford stayed away from bank stocks on the ground that these businesses were too opaque to understand properly.

It earned him criticism before the crisis but proved a good call after the collapse of Lehmans in September 2008.

Image: Woodford Investment Management founder Neil Woodford blocked savers from their cash as investors fled the fund

When Mr Woodford took a shine to a business, he bet on it big: his two funds at Invesco Perpetual owned 29.6% of the power generator Drax, 13.4% of BAE Systems and 9.9% of BT.

Yet he was also not averse to making more unconventional investments, backing a string of unquoted businesses in the early stages of their development, particularly in the life sciences sector.

Nor was he afraid to make big calls with his shareholdings.

He backed AstraZeneca's management when it resisted an unwanted takeover approach from US rival Pfizer, which proved to be a good decision, while his opposition to BAE's proposed merger in 2012 with EADS, the owner of Airbus, helped kill the deal.

On setting up his new firm, Woodford Investment Management, in May 2014, Mr Woodford promised more of the same, telling the Daily Telegraph: ""I'll be here for decades to come.

""My best years as a fund manager are still in front of me.

""I learned a lot from my successes and failures.

""I'm a better fund manager now than I was 26 years ago.""

He promised that his fund management strategy would be the same as at Invesco Perpetual, identifying companies capable of continuing to deliver dividend increases on a sustained basis, as well as an element of growth.

So what went wrong?

Perhaps one early-warning signal was his admission, at an event to promote the launch, that he had bought a banking stock - HSBC - for the first time since 2003.

Yet, to begin with, the Woodford Income Fund - which attracted £1.6bn at launch and, within months, drew in a further £1bn - appeared pretty similar to his old fund at Invesco Perpetual.

Its biggest shareholdings were AstraZeneca, Glaxosmithkline, Imperial Tobacco and BAT.

Other UK stock market stalwarts such as Rolls-Royce and Capita were also core holdings.

A number of these bets, unfortunately, soured.

GSK's share price is more or less where it was in May 2014 and has spent much of the intervening period below that.

Image: Woodford took big positions in companies such as Glaxosmithkline in his two flagship funds.

BAT and Imperial, despite their share prices rising during the first few years after Mr Woodford set up on its own, now trade at levels below where they were in May 2014.

Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, was rocked by a Serious Fraud Office investigation and it has spent most of the last five years trading below its May 2014 level.

Worse still is that there have also been a number of individual bets in non-blue chip stocks that have blown up in spectacular fashion.

They included taking a 29% stake in Utilitywise, Britain's biggest energy broker, which collapsed into administration in February this year.

Then there was Purplebricks, the hybrid estate agent, of which Mr Woodford had been a supporter before it even floated on the stock market.

Its shares fell by 64% last year, amid a softening housing market and increasing doubts over its business model, leaving Mr Woodford, who had accumulated a 29% stake in the business, nursing heavy losses.

Other flops included Provident Financial, the doorstep lender, in which Mr Woodford is the biggest shareholder with a 24.6% stake.

Its shares have fallen by 71% during the last five years.

Capita, the outsourcing group, was another big shareholding until Mr Woodford bailed out at the end of last year.

Its shares fell by 82% in the four years from May 2014.

Another disaster was Allied Minds, an intellectual property firm, in which Mr Woodford has a 27.4% shareholding.

Its shares have lost three-quarters of their value since the co-founder unexpectedly quit in April 2017.

Then there was Prothena, a struggling Irish biotech firm, in which Mr Woodford has a 29.9% stake.

Its shares have more than halved since the beginning of May 2014. Circassia Pharmaceuticals, in which Mr Woodford has a 28% stake, was another flop.

The AA, in which he has a 13.8% stake, has seen its shares fall by 53% during the last year.

And not forgetting Kier Group, the struggling construction services company, in which Mr Woodford has a 20% shareholding. Its shares fell by 40% yesterday alone.

There was further embarrassment when Mr Woodford backed Andrew Tinkler, the former chief executive of Stobart Group, when he sued the logistics company - in which Mr Woodford holds an 18.7% stake. Mr Tinkler lost.

One or two of these setbacks would have hurt any fund manager.

What really did the damage was the growing publicity around this poor performance and, in particular, some adverse coverage in the influential personal finance pages of the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday.

From a peak of £10.2bn in May 2017, the Woodford Equity Income Fund had shrivelled to a still-substantial £4.8bn by March this year as investors pulled out their money.

In order to give those investors their money back, Mr Woodford had to sell down the fund's shareholdings in its bigger, more liquid stocks, such as Imperial.

More of the companies in which Mr Woodford was heavily invested then found themselves the targets of 'short-sellers', investors who speculate on a share price falling, as they tried to predict what stocks he would have to sell next to meet redemption requests.

By March this year, Mr Woodford - who in his days at Invesco Perpetual seldom, if ever, spoke to the press - was trying to fight back.

He told the Financial Times that investors were being pushed into ""appallingly bad decisions"" by ""misinformation and lazy commentary"".

He added: ""There is a mountain of fake information and fake analysis in the marketplace which, in the end, does impact investors decisions detrimentally.

""So that's what p***** me off.

""When you passionately believe in what you're doing, as I do, when clients are saying 'nah, we want our money back now because we'd much rather be investing in these things that have gone up', that, for me, is a frustration.

""I think they're making a poor investment decision.""

He admitted that the firm could go out of business in ""about two and a half years"" if he failed to raise performance and stem the investor withdrawals.

By now, though, he had another headache.

The forced sales of big liquid quoted stocks meant that the proportion of the fund invested in unquoted companies - stakes in which can be less easily offloaded - rose as a consequence and breached the 10% limit set by regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority.

By March this year, the online financial information provider Citywire was reporting that 17.9% of the Woodford Equity Income Fund's assets were tied up in illiquid, unquoted businesses.

Mr Woodford got around this by swapping some of those shareholdings from the fund and into the quoted Woodford Patient Capital investment trust - with the fund receiving shares in the trust in exchange.

Stakes in four more companies, including Benevolent AI, one of the fund's biggest remaining investments, were hurriedly listed on Guernsey's International Stock Exchange.

Yet the redemptions kept on coming and, by last month, the Woodford Equity Income Fund was down to £3.77bn.

The last straw was a reported request from Kent County Council for £250m.

Mr Woodford was forced to slam the gate shut on his remaining investors.

A glance at the portfolio reveals why he had no choice.

Of the fund's top 10 biggest shareholdings, only two - the housebuilders Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey - are in the FTSE-100 and can be sold down easily.

He will find it less easy to offload, for example, his 8.99% shareholding in the litigation funding group Burford Capital, whose shares fell by more than 4% today, or his 23.83% shareholding in Theravance Biopharma.

So it is hard to see how the business recovers from this and easy to see why some in the City were today talking about Woodford Investment Management being in a ""death spiral"".","On setting up his new firm, Woodford Investment Management, in May 2014, Mr Woodford promised more of the same, telling the Daily Telegraph: ""I'll be here for decades to come.

130,Woodford Investments: A sorry tale of bad bets,Business Presenter,"When Neil Woodford left the fund management giant Invesco Perpetual in October 2013 to set up his own company, he was without doubt Britain's most-garlanded asset manager.

At the time of his departure, he had £33bn under management, more than any other fund manager.

That reflected the faith that more than one million savers had put in him over the previous quarter century: the Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund, which he had run since 1988, had generated a return of 2,213% while the similar Income Fund had returned 1,839%.

That was way in excess of any industry benchmarks or comparable stock indices over the period.

The key to that performance was Mr Woodford's investment style.

This was a combination of buying and holding big ""defensive"" stocks in sectors like pharmaceuticals and tobacco - solid, reliable sectors that delivered a regular and predictable stream of dividends down the years.

He took big positions in such companies, too, with drugs majors Glaxosmithkline and AstraZeneca accounting for more than 17% of his two flagship funds when he left Invesco Perpetual.

Among his other core holdings were Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant and the tobacco manufacturers British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco (now called Imperial Brands) and Reynolds American (now part of BAT).

This earned him criticism during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s but the bets paid off when, after the bubble burst in March 2000, investors rediscovered their appetite for reliable sectors like tobacco.

Similarly, during the build-up to the financial crisis, Mr Woodford stayed away from bank stocks on the ground that these businesses were too opaque to understand properly.

It earned him criticism before the crisis but proved a good call after the collapse of Lehmans in September 2008.

When Mr Woodford took a shine to a business, he bet on it big: his two funds at Invesco Perpetual owned 29.6% of the power generator Drax, 13.4% of BAE Systems and 9.9% of BT.

Yet he was also not averse to making more unconventional investments, backing a string of unquoted businesses in the early stages of their development, particularly in the life sciences sector.

Nor was he afraid to make big calls with his shareholdings.

He backed AstraZeneca's management when it resisted an unwanted takeover approach from US rival Pfizer, which proved to be a good decision, while his opposition to BAE's proposed merger in 2012 with EADS, the owner of Airbus, helped kill the deal.

131,Political roadkill to phoenix: Can the Liberal Democrat surge last?,Lewis Goodall,"I’ve been a journalist since 2012 and not once in that time have I seen the Lib Dems look… happy.

For years they've been the running joke of British politics. The Lib Dem bird barely twitching in the road: political roadkill.

Yet all of a sudden that roadkill has shown signs of life - it is now more phoenix than anything else.

Out of nowhere, their poll rating has risen and quickly; mammoth local election gains, equally impressive European results. The question is why and why now?

Politics is sometimes beguilingly mysterious. In one sense it's difficult to divine the exact cause of this Lib Dem revivification.

Many conditions remain the same. Their leader remains the same, their policy on Brexit has been entirely consistent, there is little objective reason why their rebirth should come now and not at any other time over the past year or more.

Until very recently, so unlikely did an absolution of their reputation seem that a whole new progressive party was founded on the precise rationale that it couldn't.

So instead, during a long interregnum, they barely secured a look in.

:: Lib Dems would win general election if it was held tomorrow - poll

The impressive blocs of voters both main parties put together in 2017 (80% plus of the electorate) largely held.

Through all the Brexit cataclysms, throughout the antisemitism debacle, nothing seemed to dent either. The Brexit culture war insulated both against any travail or woe, voters ostensibly afraid to retreat from their respective camps, lest the other steal a march.

Even when May failed to get her deal through, once, twice, three times - the Conservatives' ratings held but the stasis finally seemed to dissipate in spring of this year and in particular after Britain's failure to leave on 29 March.

Image: Sheila Ritchie (centre) picked up one of Scotland's MEP seats for the Lib Dems

There are moments when governments and prime ministers lose their credibility: Black Wednesday for John Major, the Lebanon-Israel conflict for Tony Blair, the election that never was for Gordon Brown.

They never recover, either in the eyes of their party or the electorate. May lost both on 29 March and the drop off was a rapid one.

Perhaps Brexiters did not follow the minutiae of Theresa May's Brexit calamities, they did not closely observe the botched summits nor the cabinet walkouts, but they did notice that we hadn't left.

They lent the Conservatives their vote in 2017 and quietly resumed their lives, as 'twas ever thus with voters, tuning out the daily political noise with an inherent assumption that those they voted for would do as they were tasked.

When they tuned back in and noticed, despite the prime minister's scores of assurances, that we hadn't left, those votes were called in and lent anew, this time in fury rather than in trust, to the Brexit Party, conveniently and strategically founded for that very purpose.

The genesis of this new force, I suspect, started a political redox reaction - Farage's success frightened many Remainers and it is that fear which to some extent explains the resurrection of the Lib Dems.

Remainers saw the Brexit Party, with its unyielding, uncompromising message and came to fear that there existed no equivalent counterweight.

Image: Farage's success scared many Remainers and that - to some extent - explains the Lib Dem resurgence

But it's more than just fear, the Lib Dem rise is umbilically attached to its Brexit mirror image.

The very presence of the Brexit Party on the ballot paper, the word ""Brexit"" squarely eyeballing every voter in the polling booth now subverts every election.

It makes each one, to some extent at least, a mini-referendum on Brexit itself. This simple yet genius name has allowed the party to hoover up Leave support.

Every vote cast for them, every election won imbues a hard Brexit with extra legitimacy. When people furiously object that they have no manifesto, no other policies, it is to miss the point.

The party exists only to add legitimation to their project. And that is why political physics demanded a balancing force: an alternative, a corresponding Remain option on every ballot paper too.

Had Change UK the foresight to call themselves ""The Remain Party"", it would have been theirs for the taking - but they erred.

Remainers waited too for a firm response from Labour but answer came there none, just more flannel, more ponderous wandering in their own Brexit maze of hell.

Such obfuscation was unsatisfactory, because the simplicity of the Brexit Party, required a response as unabashed.

Image: The party's manifesto for the European election had a clear message

Worse, day after day, Corbyn confirmed Remainers' fears that a vote for Labour could not be construed as a true anti-Brexit Party vote by repeatedly imploring electors to vote about a subject other than Europe, to care about something else, to be divided about other things, to vote for him for another reason.

But that was to misunderstand the rearranging of the political equation going on all around him, this was the crucial, essential issue - asking voters to care about something else, to categorise themselves as something other than Remainer or Brexiter a pipe dream; consequently Corbyn appeared almost an inert, disinterested figure out of his own time, watching whilst politics fizzed.

As Labour traipsed into talks with the government every day, it became ever clearer the natural home of discontent, the Opposition, was no longer available. They became caught in a horrible bind: Leavers were angry they weren't cooperating enough. Remainers furious they seemed to be cooperating too much.

And so, as Remainers' patience with Labour broke, they appraised the other means available and found the Lib Dems the best fit - a party which, whatever their previous record, had been at least consistent, the best yin, to the Brexit Party's yang.

Their resurrection came because the moment demanded it - the need for them to be absolved of their sins, has absolved them of their sins. It has led to some truly stunning gains.

Many observers of politics, especially on Twitter, spent much time in the wake of the European analysing the Brexit Party and Lib Dem performances, expending much energy between themselves arguing about who really won.

The truth is, they both did. Their victories were connected and intertwined and may become increasingly symbiotic. So long as the Brexit Party exists, at least, the performance of the Lib Dems will be enhanced.

9 May: Cable - 'We are now a remain country'

They are two sides of the same coin: the rise of both represents a firm turn in our Brexit politics away from any compromise position and to purity.

The biggest danger for whoever takes over as Lib Dem leader (and for the Brexit Party for that matter) is that the default setting of British politics inevitably clicks back in.

The Lib Dems will be extremely vulnerable to any flight of Remainer voters: in a general election not only will Labour be able to train in their crosshairs on the Lib Dems' coalition record on austerity (both putative contenders served in the coalition government) but also wear once more upon the comfortable armour plated shroud that is our electoral system.

They will say that any vote lost to the Lib Dems helps guarantee a Tory majority, worse a majority of a no-dealer prime minister.

In reverse, the Conservative Party will make the same argument about the Brexit Party, that indulging your deepest Brexit passions will result only in the opposite of what you want, a Labour government beholden to the Lib Dems and SNP, determined to reverse Brexit altogether. As before, this will prove potent.

That it is still easily the most likely scenario, but the danger for the main parties is what sustained their big vote shares for so long - that culture war- will now sustain these new(ish) entrants to the political marketplace.

That if the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems truly have convinced voters that they, not the old forces, are the best guarantors of their preferred Brexit outcomes then those voters might prove as difficult to lure away from their new homes as they did for so long from their old.

And if a poll lead for both challengers becomes sustained the ever harder that task will become.

Image: Jo Swinson is one of these bidding to take over from Sir Vince Cable

Indeed if the leads become so large, it will be the challengers that will try to argue that the risk lies with voting for the old parties not the new. That's a long way off yet - though the latest poll out this weekend puts the Brexit Party in first place with the Lib Dems but one point behind Labour.

It is not yet certain we are at a moment of irredeemable crisis for the two party system but given it's happening all over Europe, we shouldn't be surprised if finally, FPTP notwithstanding it happens here too.

And if it does and an appeal to our outmoded, rickety electoral system is the best Labour and the Tories have got, then perhaps those two main parties really don't deserve that status any more.","I’ve been a journalist since 2012 and not once in that time have I seen the Lib Dems look… happy.

Many observers of politics, especially on Twitter, spent much time in the wake of the European analysing the Brexit Party and Lib Dem performances, expending much energy between themselves arguing about who really won.

The truth is, they both did. Their victories were connected and intertwined and may become increasingly symbiotic. So long as the Brexit Party exists, at least, the performance of the Lib Dems will be enhanced.

9 May: Cable - 'We are now a remain country'

They are two sides of the same coin: the rise of both represents a firm turn in our Brexit politics away from any compromise position and to purity.

The biggest danger for whoever takes over as Lib Dem leader (and for the Brexit Party for that matter) is that the default setting of British politics inevitably clicks back in.

The Lib Dems will be extremely vulnerable to any flight of Remainer voters: in a general election not only will Labour be able to train in their crosshairs on the Lib Dems' coalition record on austerity (both putative contenders served in the coalition government) but also wear once more upon the comfortable armour plated shroud that is our electoral system.

They will say that any vote lost to the Lib Dems helps guarantee a Tory majority, worse a majority of a no-dealer prime minister.

In reverse, the Conservative Party will make the same argument about the Brexit Party, that indulging your deepest Brexit passions will result only in the opposite of what you want, a Labour government beholden to the Lib Dems and SNP, determined to reverse Brexit altogether. As before, this will prove potent.

That it is still easily the most likely scenario, but the danger for the main parties is what sustained their big vote shares for so long - that culture war- will now sustain these new(ish) entrants to the political marketplace.

That if the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems truly have convinced voters that they, not the old forces, are the best guarantors of their preferred Brexit outcomes then those voters might prove as difficult to lure away from their new homes as they did for so long from their old.

And if a poll lead for both challengers becomes sustained the ever harder that task will become.

Indeed if the leads become so large, it will be the challengers that will try to argue that the risk lies with voting for the old parties not the new. That's a long way off yet - though the latest poll out this weekend puts the Brexit Party in first place with the Lib Dems but one point behind Labour.

It is not yet certain we are at a moment of irredeemable crisis for the two party system but given it's happening all over Europe, we shouldn't be surprised if finally, FPTP notwithstanding it happens here too.

And if it does and an appeal to our outmoded, rickety electoral system is the best Labour and the Tories have got, then perhaps those two main parties really don't deserve that status any more.","I’ve been a journalist since 2012 and not once in that time have I seen the Lib Dems look… happy.
The Lib Dem bird barely twitching in the road: political roadkill.
In one sense it's difficult to divine the exact cause of this Lib Dem revivification.
Remainers saw the Brexit Party, with its unyielding, uncompromising message and came to fear that there existed no equivalent counterweight.
So long as the Brexit Party exists, at least, the performance of the Lib Dems will be enhanced.","['democrat', 'brexit', 'party', 'lib', 'dems', 'vote', 'election', 'labour', 'political', 'voters', 'surge', 'roadkill', 'dem', 'liberal', 'phoenix']",,https://news.sky.com/analysis

Controversies make it seem that Labour is failing to listen to critics

If Labour had listened sooner to its critics, would it have suffered so badly in the EU elections?

Tuesday saw the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) launch an investigation into Labour's handling of antisemitism allegations. Meanwhile, the party expelled Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former director of communications, after he admitted to voting Liberal Democrat in the recent EU elections.

From the outside, these two things are not linked - the party has been grappling with complaints about antisemitism for some time and Mr Campbell has been at odds with Labour's current leader since he stepped into Ed Miliband's shoes.

But what they reveal is a bigger problem - a perception that the party fails to listen and engage with those critical of the leadership.

Allegations of antisemitism or Islamophobia against big organisations like political parties are not new - the Conservatives are currently facing complaints about their perceived lack of action too.

But it is the way organisations deal with issues like these which can determine the extent to which they cling on, refusing to be resolved.

Jeremy Corbyn may have thought he had tackled questions about antisemitism within Labour when he launched a report into it in 2016.

But it was the treatment of a Jewish Labour MP by a supporter of Mr Corbyn at that event which for many revealed more than the document itself.

Despite leaving the room close to tears over comments made about her, Ruth Smeeth MP did not receive a call afterwards from the party leader.

Instead she was branded a troublemaker - someone trying to bring down Mr Corbyn and his team.

Watchdog to investigate Labour antisemitism claims

On Tuesday, she told Channel 4 News that the party has used the expulsion of Mr Campbell as a convenient way to distract attention from the antisemitism investigation.

The pattern has been repeated since, with Luciana Berger leaving Labour altogether after she received antisemitic abuse and death threats.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Again Mr Corbyn did not reach out, and again Ms Berger was painted as a traitor trying to oust him.

Deep criticism from Labour MPs followed, as did accusations of inaction and intervention from senior members of his team into the complaints process.

Although he cannot be held directly responsible for the threats aimed at Jewish MPs, Mr Corbyn does control the response to them.

The question many in the party ask is why has more not been done, and sooner?

Kicking me out 'a strange thing to do'

The EHRC investigation comes after it tried to engage with Labour over how it could solve the problem.

In a statement the EHRC said: ""We contacted Labour after receiving a number of complaints about allegations of antisemitism in the party.

""We have carefully considered the response we received from the party and have now opened a formal investigation under section 20 of the Equality Act 2006 to further examine the concerns.""

The response was not good enough to prevent an inquiry - but why not?

A similar pattern emerges with the party's response to Alastair Campbell.

He is not the first to question whether Labour deserves their vote. Lord Andrew Adonis, who stood as a candidate for the party in the South West in the EU Elections, publicly called for people not to back Labour.

By all accounts this breaks the same rules that Mr Campbell is accused of ignoring, and yet he has not been expelled.

The rules do not appear to be applied equally.

'There is no Brexit compromise'

Mr Campbell had been warning for some time that Labour needed to take a clearer position on Brexit and back a public vote, something it now appears to be doing.

But not before voters dealt it a crushing blow in the EU elections.

If the party had listened sooner, would it have suffered so badly?

And if it had paid closer attention to the antisemitic abuse received by its own Jewish MPs would it now be facing an investigation?","Controversies make it seem that Labour is failing to listen to criticsControversies make it seem that Labour is failing to listen to criticsIf Labour had listened sooner to its critics, would it have suffered so badly in the EU elections?

How EU shake-up will work - and why it matters for Brexit

Naturally the UK, or Westminster at least, is wrapped up in the race for who will become the next prime minister.

And, naturally, EU leaders are looking on with trepidation at who might succeed Mrs May.

But there's another leadership race they are much more focused on. Several in fact.

At the end of October, Jean-Claude Juncker's term as President of the European Commission will come to an end.

His 28 commissioners will retire from their posts and probably head back to where they all came from - national politics or diplomacy.

Image: Michel Barnier could become Commission president

The European Central Bank (ECB) will get a new chief, as will the European External Action Service (EEAS - the EU's Foreign Office) as Mario Draghi and Federica Mogherini's terms both come to an end.

Donald Tusk will relinquish the post of European Council President and the Parliament too will replace President Antonio Tajani.

It is all change in the European Union machine and the mechanics is complicated.

It involves a good dose of horse trading, a democratic legitimacy that some will inevitably question and a few artful manoeuvres. And it all begins in earnest at tonight's European Council summit.

Image: Danish candidate for the European Commission presidency, Margrethe Vestager

The key word is spitzenkandidat - the name for a system introduced in 2014 in an attempt to make the EU more democratic and accountable.

Prior to that, the president of the EU Commission (which proposes EU legislation) was nominated by European Council (made up of the elected leaders of the EU member countries). Under the spitzenkandidat system, the political groups of the European Parliament put forward candidates and the lead candidate (spitzenkandidat) gets the job.

Image: Manfred Weber is backed by the likes of Angela Merkel

However, to secure that position, the successful candidate needs the backing of a qualified majority of the European Council (the elected EU leaders) and a majority from the European Parliament (the 751 elected MEPs).

The official lead candidate is German MEP Manfred Weber because the political group to which his German party is associated (the centre right EPP) is the largest in the parliament.

But, despite being backed by German Chancellor Merkel, Mr Weber isn't all that popular among the EU leaders who also don't hugely like the spitzenkandidat process either.

Image: Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite may have a new job soon

Here's where the horse trading comes in. Different EU countries have different visions for the EU. If they can get their candidate into the top job in the Commission then their vision can be realised.

It is perfectly possible that none of the candidates put forward from each of the European Parliament political groups actually gets the job.

French President Emanuel Macron, who is pushing for liberal-leaning reforms and further EU integration, doesn't like Mr Weber and his centre-right vision.

Image: Angela Merkel and Mark Rutte could be going head-to-head for the council presidency

Mr Weber may also struggle to get a majority in the Parliament because the weekend's European Parliament elections gave a boost for the liberal ALDE group and the Greens too.

So, at tonight's summit, the outgoing council president Mr Tusk will try to begin to find some consensus among the leaders.

Is there a candidate they can agree on? Is there a compromise candidate? If certain countries are satisfied with their person in another job - high representative in the EEAS or head of the ECB then can consensus be found that way?

Is Farage right? Have the main political parties blown it for good?

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage reacts after the European Parliament election results for the South East are announced

Nigel Farage has done it again - gifted a victory in the EU elections by the Tories' failure to deliver Brexit.

His newborn Brexit Party may be just six weeks old, but it has managed to top the polls and secure 29 MEPs.

The former UKIP leader with a new team and a well-worn Brexit betrayal battle cry: Mr Farage was here to settle old scores with political rivals as he launched attacks on a political establishment ""no longer fit for purpose"".

I put it to him that he and his Brexit Party will be irrelevant if and when the Tories do deliver Brexit; he was having none of it.

""If the Tories deliver Brexit?"" he asks, turning to his new MEPs and laughing.

Advertisement

""Is that the same as the 108 times Theresa May said we're leaving on 29 March with or without a deal? Did that happen? The truth of it is this, the Conservative Party are bitterly divided.""

What this EU election showed is that voters are too, and the grand coalition politics of the two main parties, trying to accommodate a wide range of views, has been comprehensively rejected by the electorate - for now.

This was the worst performance in over 200 years for the Tories as they came in fifth behind the Greens.

And Labour didn't do that much better, coming in third behind the Lib Dems.

Between them, the ""compromise parties"" scraped 23% of the vote, as pro-hard Brexit parties clocked up 34% and anti-Brexit ones 39%.

So the Brexit Party in first place, the Lib Dems in second. A piece of history made. In a way, it is not particularly surprising.

The Brexit riddle is the great unsolved conundrum of our times, defining not just our political discourse but increasingly our political identities.

Because in truth party politics has been set aside as MPs and voters coalesce around Brexit lines rather than the old tribes.

European elections: Winners and losers

As leading pollster Sir John Curtice observed back in January this year, ours is a country that is increasingly defined - and polarised - by Brexit identities rather than party ones.

Only one in 16 Britons - 6% of respondents - did not have a Brexit identity, while more than one in five polled said they did not have a party identity.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Mr Farage predicted back in January, when the Curtice polling first came out, that ""if the Brexit ball gets dropped there is a chance for a new party, perhaps even a realignment of British politics"".

And so it came to pass as Mrs May delayed Brexit not once, but twice, moving the exit date to 31 October. It gave Mr Farage the perfect platform from which to campaign in elections we were never meant to hold.

Ann Widdecombe: The nation is fed up

Polling released on Monday by Lord Ashcroft found that two-thirds of the Brexit Party votes came from those who voted Tory in the 2017 general election, while the biggest single chunk of Lib Dem support came from 2017 Labour voters (37%) and 24% coming from Tories.

The two main parties reacted swiftly on Monday as they digested their respective election bloodbaths.

For the ruling Conservative Party, the pressure to leave the EU without a deal stepped up, with deputy chairman of the eurosceptic ERG group Steve Baker telling me that Brexit must be delivered this year, whatever the consequences.

""Yes the government could collapse,"" he admitted when I asked him about the Remainer revolt on his own benches should a new PM push the country to no deal.

""But if it does collapse its because Tory MPs have failed to live up to their promises and responsibilities to the public.""

And then on the Labour side, open warfare on the frontbench as shadow chancellor John McDonnell (and others) tried to drag Jeremy Corbyn to a more unequivocal pro second referendum position, telling Sky News that Labour's ""only option now is to go back to the people in a referendum"".

'Our only option now is a referendum'

Both sides polarising, it is even harder to see how they can ever agree Theresa May's compromise plan. The Tories' only hope is that Labour MPs in Leave seats will be spooked enough by the Labour frontbench's apparent attempt to shift Labour to a pro-referendum position that they break ranks and finally support some form of Tory Brexit deal.

Another interesting nugget in the Lord Ashcroft polling is that only one in three 2017 Conservatives who switched to the Brexit party said they would come back to the Tories in the next general election. Just over half said they would stay with Mr Farage and his team.

It feeds into the point Mr Farage made to me at his valedictory press conference on Monday: the main political parties, having failed to live up to their Brexit pledge to the electorate in 2017, have blown it for good with their supporters. They won't be coming back. He genuinely believes this is a realignment of British politics.

But, his success still remains dependent on Brexit failure. Remember that in 2014, UKIP topped the EU poll - Mr Farage's ""political earthquake"" - only for the two main parties to pull in 80% of the popular vote in a general election in which they both promised to honour the results of the 2016 referendum.

Neither the Tories nor Labour will want to risk a general election with Brexit unresolved for fear of huge losses at the polls.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage reacts after the European Parliament election results for the South East are announced

Nigel Farage has done it again - gifted a victory in the EU elections by the Tories' failure to deliver Brexit.

His newborn Brexit Party may be just six weeks old, but it has managed to top the polls and secure 29 MEPs.

The former UKIP leader with a new team and a well-worn Brexit betrayal battle cry: Mr Farage was here to settle old scores with political rivals as he launched attacks on a political establishment ""no longer fit for purpose"".

I put it to him that he and his Brexit Party will be irrelevant if and when the Tories do deliver Brexit; he was having none of it.

""If the Tories deliver Brexit?"" he asks, turning to his new MEPs and laughing.

""Is that the same as the 108 times Theresa May said we're leaving on 29 March with or without a deal? Did that happen? The truth of it is this, the Conservative Party are bitterly divided.""

What this EU election showed is that voters are too, and the grand coalition politics of the two main parties, trying to accommodate a wide range of views, has been comprehensively rejected by the electorate - for now.

This was the worst performance in over 200 years for the Tories as they came in fifth behind the Greens.

And Labour didn't do that much better, coming in third behind the Lib Dems.

Between them, the ""compromise parties"" scraped 23% of the vote, as pro-hard Brexit parties clocked up 34% and anti-Brexit ones 39%.

So the Brexit Party in first place, the Lib Dems in second. A piece of history made. In a way, it is not particularly surprising.

The Brexit riddle is the great unsolved conundrum of our times, defining not just our political discourse but increasingly our political identities.

Because in truth party politics has been set aside as MPs and voters coalesce around Brexit lines rather than the old tribes.

European elections: Winners and losers

As leading pollster Sir John Curtice observed back in January this year, ours is a country that is increasingly defined - and polarised - by Brexit identities rather than party ones.

Only one in 16 Britons - 6% of respondents - did not have a Brexit identity, while more than one in five polled said they did not have a party identity.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Mr Farage predicted back in January, when the Curtice polling first came out, that ""if the Brexit ball gets dropped there is a chance for a new party, perhaps even a realignment of British politics"".

And so it came to pass as Mrs May delayed Brexit not once, but twice, moving the exit date to 31 October. It gave Mr Farage the perfect platform from which to campaign in elections we were never meant to hold.

Ann Widdecombe: The nation is fed up

Polling released on Monday by Lord Ashcroft found that two-thirds of the Brexit Party votes came from those who voted Tory in the 2017 general election, while the biggest single chunk of Lib Dem support came from 2017 Labour voters (37%) and 24% coming from Tories.

The two main parties reacted swiftly on Monday as they digested their respective election bloodbaths.

For the ruling Conservative Party, the pressure to leave the EU without a deal stepped up, with deputy chairman of the eurosceptic ERG group Steve Baker telling me that Brexit must be delivered this year, whatever the consequences.

141,Nigel Farage brings Brexit showbiz to Southampton in one-man show,Jon Craig,"A double bill of big box office showbiz acts came to Southampton this Bank Holiday weekend.

Pop band Take That, fronted by Gary Barlow these days after a comeback, played at the city's St Mary's football stadium.

And at the Southampton Guildhall, meanwhile, Nigel Farage - making his latest political comeback with his new Brexit Party - issued a ""take that"" slap in the face to the Conservatives and Labour.

Nigel Farage is to politics what old rockers like Rod Stewart, Elton John or Tom Jones are to pop music: Loud, extrovert and belting out the same old tunes to the delight of his fans.

The South East region count for the elections to the European Parliament may not sound like a sell-out box office event full of thrills.

'A big win for the Brexit Party' - Farage

But when the charismatic leader of the newly formed Brexit Party is noisily accusing the two big parties of a sell-out of a different kind, to his fans he's a god-like rock star and to his political opponents a pantomime villain.

At one point after the results for the region were declared - with the Brexit Party winning four seats, the Liberal Democrats three and the Greens, Tories and Labour one each - some Green Party activists turned on the media.

It happened as Mr Farage was giving his umpteenth interview and the complaint was that the media is guilty of giving the Brexit leader too much publicity. Well, to be fair, he was the undisputed winner of these elections.

There was then a rather undignified shouting match between some Brexit Party and Green activists, which was all rather silly, since both parties had had a good night.

When I interviewed Mr Farage earlier - OK, twice, I admit - he was talking about preparing for a general election and demanding a role for his party in Brexit negotiations.

When I asked him if he would stand in the next general election, he said: ""I'll have to, won't I?""

Image: Mr Farage was elected for his new Brexit Party in the South East

Throughout the evening, everywhere Mr Farage turned in the vast Guildhall he was mobbed by TV crews, reporters and photographers, while other politicians were largely ignored.

The only other UK politician that attracts such rock star adulation from supporters and full-on media attention is Boris Johnson.

Which explains why, after these stunningly good Euro election results for the Brexit Party and the collapse of the Tory vote, Conservative activists are in a frenzied panic and so desperate to crown Boris as their new party leader.

Mr Farage is more professional these days than he was a few years ago, however. His message is simpler and he appears more disciplined. It's claimed he has cut down on the beer, too. There was certainly no whiff of it when I spoke to him.

He certainly hasn't cut down on the fags, though. His voice is throaty and sounds as if he has just smoked a full strength cigarette, or more than one, which he probably has.

In his victory speech from the platform after the declaration he was short and to the point again.

In the speeches that followed, a Lib Dem winner, Antony Hook, spoke movingly about how his heroes Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy would have been proud of the party's success.

Widdecombe: 'Only the Brexit Party will deliver Brexit'

Daniel Hannan, the Tory eurosceptic who wrote in his Sunday Telegraph column that he didn't expect to hold his seat, gave a speech like a sermon from the pulpit about the need for politicians to be more civilised to each other and tolerant of opposing opinions. Good luck with that!

The last speech was by Labour's John Howarth, who scraped in in 10th place and was clearly angry at Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit policy. In a bitter speech, he said: ""This undefined fantasy must be properly defined.""

Labour, after all, came fifth here in the South East region, behind the Brexit Party, the Lib Dems, Greens and Conservatives. At least Labour beat Change UK here, though.

But this count at the Guildhall was a one-man show, which is, of course, what critics say about the Brexit Party and used to say about Mr Farage's former party, UKIP.

One of Take That and Gary Barlow's biggest hits was Back For Good.

After the Brexit Party's triumph in the Euro elections, Nigel Farage would claim he's back for good.

Or bad, his opponents would claim.

144,Election results reveal Britain's deepening polarisation over Brexit,Will Jennings,"Nearly three years after the UK voted by a narrow majority to leave the EU, the Brexit Party - formed just six weeks ago - topped the polls in the UK's elections to the European Parliament, providing a further signal of Britain's deepening polarisation over the issue of Brexit.

In elections that few back in June 2016 could have anticipated would happen, the party picked up over 30% of the vote and 29 seats in the European Parliament - exceeding the 24 seats won by UKIP in 2014 and making advances on its vote too.

Unsurprisingly, it won more support in areas that had voted to Leave the EU in 2016 - further hardening political divides that were crystallised by the referendum. The vote highlighted that a substantial number of voters were drawn towards a party intensely opposed to the UK's membership of the EU and demanding a swift outcome to the process of leaving, which to date has proved so tricky for the Conservative government.

Sky's political correspondent Lewis Goodall takes us through how election night has unfolded across the UK

The other winners on the night were the Liberal Democrats, whose vote was up 15% from 2014, and the Green Party, who gained 4%. The parties won seats in most regions, and will form a substantial bloc of MEPs opposed to Brexit. Along with the SNP, the Remain-supporting parties won over 35% of the vote. Support for the parties mirrored that for the Brexit Party, being higher in areas that voted to Remain in the EU in 2016.

In the final reckoning, the principal winners of the elections were a party demanding that Britain leave the EU and two parties that have been vocal in their support for remaining in the EU. As such, the elections signalled the hardening of two distinct electoral blocs - divided by their opposing views of Brexit.

In contrast, the election delivered a devastating blow to Britain's two main parties of government and opposition. The Conservatives endured a fall of 15% in their vote share from 2014, while Labour saw its vote fall 10%, with just a fifth of votes in total cast for the two parties.

Ann Widdecombe MEP says

Surely no other national election in modern political history has seen the stock of the parties at such a low ebb. There were few bright spots for the parties on the night, with each experiencing double digit drops in their vote in most regions - with the Conservatives left with no MEPs in seven regions. UKIP were also wiped out, losing all their 24 seats to Farage's new party.

With the combined vote share of Leave and Remain parties finely balanced, the result will settle nothing of the debate over if and how the UK should leave the EU. Instead it exposes the political divides brought into focus by the referendum, but provides no clear answer on how this polarisation might be resolved. Rather it could push the night's losers, the Conservative and Labour parties, to the extremes, but at considerable risk to their electoral coalitions.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the EU election results indicate a huge win for his party

For the Conservatives, the temptation will be to fast-track Brexit and flirt with the option of no-deal - but that is hardly a straightforward task, as negotiations so far have proven. Labour, on the other hand, might look to regain some of the supporters that have abandoned it over the party's ambiguous and indifferent position on Brexit, but building an electoral base on voters who readily switch between them, the Greens and Liberal Democrats, depending on the election and the issue of the day, is an unreliable recipe for future electoral success - and risks writing-off large parts of Labour's traditional heartlands.

These elections provide no simple answer to the riddle of Brexit, but instead expose the calcification of a fragmented British party system into Leave and Remain blocs, with the traditional parties caught in the crossfire.

146,Election results reveal Britain's deepening polarisation over Brexit,Public Policy,"Nearly three years after the UK voted by a narrow majority to leave the EU, the Brexit Party - formed just six weeks ago - topped the polls in the UK's elections to the European Parliament, providing a further signal of Britain's deepening polarisation over the issue of Brexit.

In elections that few back in June 2016 could have anticipated would happen, the party picked up over 30% of the vote and 29 seats in the European Parliament - exceeding the 24 seats won by UKIP in 2014 and making advances on its vote too.

Unsurprisingly, it won more support in areas that had voted to Leave the EU in 2016 - further hardening political divides that were crystallised by the referendum. The vote highlighted that a substantial number of voters were drawn towards a party intensely opposed to the UK's membership of the EU and demanding a swift outcome to the process of leaving, which to date has proved so tricky for the Conservative government.

The other winners on the night were the Liberal Democrats, whose vote was up 15% from 2014, and the Green Party, who gained 4%. The parties won seats in most regions, and will form a substantial bloc of MEPs opposed to Brexit. Along with the SNP, the Remain-supporting parties won over 35% of the vote. Support for the parties mirrored that for the Brexit Party, being higher in areas that voted to Remain in the EU in 2016.

In the final reckoning, the principal winners of the elections were a party demanding that Britain leave the EU and two parties that have been vocal in their support for remaining in the EU. As such, the elections signalled the hardening of two distinct electoral blocs - divided by their opposing views of Brexit.

In contrast, the election delivered a devastating blow to Britain's two main parties of government and opposition. The Conservatives endured a fall of 15% in their vote share from 2014, while Labour saw its vote fall 10%, with just a fifth of votes in total cast for the two parties.

Ann Widdecombe MEP says

Surely no other national election in modern political history has seen the stock of the parties at such a low ebb. There were few bright spots for the parties on the night, with each experiencing double digit drops in their vote in most regions - with the Conservatives left with no MEPs in seven regions. UKIP were also wiped out, losing all their 24 seats to Farage's new party.

With the combined vote share of Leave and Remain parties finely balanced, the result will settle nothing of the debate over if and how the UK should leave the EU. Instead it exposes the political divides brought into focus by the referendum, but provides no clear answer on how this polarisation might be resolved. Rather it could push the night's losers, the Conservative and Labour parties, to the extremes, but at considerable risk to their electoral coalitions.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the EU election results indicate a huge win for his party

For the Conservatives, the temptation will be to fast-track Brexit and flirt with the option of no-deal - but that is hardly a straightforward task, as negotiations so far have proven. Labour, on the other hand, might look to regain some of the supporters that have abandoned it over the party's ambiguous and indifferent position on Brexit, but building an electoral base on voters who readily switch between them, the Greens and Liberal Democrats, depending on the election and the issue of the day, is an unreliable recipe for future electoral success - and risks writing-off large parts of Labour's traditional heartlands.

These elections provide no simple answer to the riddle of Brexit, but instead expose the calcification of a fragmented British party system into Leave and Remain blocs, with the traditional parties caught in the crossfire.

EU elections analysis: Centrists in retreat but no far-right populist surge

The European Parliament elections delivered a blow to the two major party groups - the centre-right EPP and the centre-left S&D - that have controlled the chamber for four decades.

But we did not see the anti-EU far-right surge that many observers had predicted. Instead the pro-European Liberal and Greens groups had as much to celebrate as the national populists.

With most results in, the informal ""grand coalition"" of the EPP and S&D lost the majority they have held since the first elections to the European Parliament in 1979.

The centre-right EPP will remain the largest party group, but is projected to win just 180 MEPs (24%) of the total 751 MEPs, down from 217 seats in 2014.

The centre-left S&D has come second in the parliament with 146 MEPs (20%).

In Germany, France and the UK, this was a bad election for social democrats.

Nigel Farage: Brexit is the new status quo

But socialists did well in Spain, where Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's PSOE topped the polls, and in Malta, where Prime Minister Joseph Muscat's Labour Party won 55% of the votes.

As the EPP and S&D will not control a parliamentary majority, they will have to work together with other party groups.

The strengthened liberal group ALDE (109 seats), which has joined forces with Emmanuel Macron's En Marche, could be the king-makers in the new parliament.

Image: Annalena Baerbock and Sven Giegold, of the German Greens, celebrate their success

Combined, these three pro-EU centrist party groups control 435 seats (58%), enough to dominate policy-making.

One of their first jobs will be to approve the next president of the European Commission. There are no guarantees that the choice will be the lead candidate of the largest group, EPP's Manfred Weber.

In the run-up to these elections, much of the focus has been on the rise of eurosceptic populists across Europe.

Image: Matteo Salvini's League came first in Italy

The elections did not bring the expected populist surge, but the radical right did well in a number of countries.

The greatest gains were made in Italy by the League, the populist anti-immigrant party of deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, which stormed into first place ahead of the pro-EU centrists and its populist coalition partner, 5-Star Movement.

In Spain, the nationalist Vox gained representation in the European Parliament for the first time, but with fewer seats than expected, and in Belgium the anti-immigration Vlaams Belang made an electoral comeback.

Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally beat Macron's En Marche at the finish line in France, but with a lower share of the vote than in 2014.

Image: Nigel Farage said the results sent 'a big message' to Westminster

The most successful anti-EU party was British newcomer the Brexit Party, which, despite being only six weeks old, will form the biggest party delegation in the new parliament, as long as the UK remains in the EU.

Across western Europe, Green parties did better than expected.

In Germany, the Greens came far ahead of the social democrats, in second place behind Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats.

The Greens also did well in Austria, Ireland, France and the UK.

The elections' biggest winner was the European Union itself.

After suffering declining turnout in each consecutive election since 1979, turnout was up at 50.5%, compared with just 42.6% in 2014 and 43% in 2009.

Theresa May was broken by Brexit, it is likely to break her successor too

Theresa May goes back into Number 10 after her emotional resignation speech

It has been a political career defined by not showing emotion.

Theresa May was a prime minister nicknamed ""the Maybot"" for her robotic and disengaged public appearances.

And yet, after 20 years on the political frontline, she ended her career in the most human of ways: overwhelmed and breaking into tears as she said goodbye to the job she loved.

After fronting it out for so long as a tough, resilient, immovable leader, sight of her vulnerability and humanity on the steps of Number 10 showed a very different prime minister than we have perhaps come to know.

I'm told that as she walked back into Number 10, her staff, in tears to match her own, had a laugh as the prime minister was forced to walk around a sedentary Larry the cat who refused to make way for his departing owner.

Meanwhile, James Brokenshire, an old political friend who had served with her at the Home Office, told me how she'd phoned him to tell her he was standing down at breakfast, just before she met Sir Graham Brady in Number 10.

He was on his way to an advice surgery in his constituency when he took the call.

Theresa May broke down in tears after announcing her exit

The prime minster told him to carry on doing that rather than come to Downing Street to support her.

""She said 'Well that's important, what's important is actually getting on... doing the job', and I suppose that sums up who she is. Because you see the work she does in her constituency, that is just so important to her.""

:: Listen to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Others in her cabinet were informed by telephone that she was about to resign as she held her meeting with Sir Graham.

Her final surrender came after a drawn-out fight with her cabinet and her party.

Mrs May ignored political convention, battling through a confidence vote in her leadership; through three parliamentary defeats of her key Brexit legislation; and two extensions to Brexit.

Any one of those things would be enough to bring a prime minister down but she defied political gravity.

But the combination of the two Brexit extensions, the cross-party talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the attempt to bring back her deal a fourth time with the prospect of a second referendum attached proved too much even for her.

And so came the end of May.

Hers has been one of the shortest tenures of any post-war prime minister and her government has passed less legislation that any other in the last three decades, consumed and paralysed in equal measure by Brexit.

It is a tenure that will be chalked up as a failure, and she will no doubt be cast by many as the villain in this mess.

You can see the missteps along the way. Mrs May drew her Brexit red lines - no single market, no customs union, no freedom of movement, or EU court jurisdiction in the UK - too early and rigidly.

She was intransigent and unpersuasive and too slow to adjust the political realities of a minority government. She was only ever going to get Brexit across the line on the back of some sort of cross-party compromise. But she left those talks far too late.

That leadership vacuum only served to calcify arch Brexiteer and arch Remainer positions as both sides dug their trenches deeper rather than trying to move on to common ground.

But she was also dealt a dire hand. She never really had the numbers to pass a Brexit deal through parliament, either before her snap election or after it.

David Cameron not only left her with a country reeling from a divisive referendum, but also left her with a majority of just 12 MPs in 2016. She lost her final Brexit deal by 58 votes. Thirty four Conservatives voted against her deal.

Mrs May also faced a difficult opposition. In Jeremy Corbyn, she has the most tribal of Labour leaders since Michael Foot; the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon set on using Brexit as a vehicle to launch an independence campaign; and a Liberal Democrat party which would never be shifted from its position of remain.

Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and one of Mrs May's true allies in Europe, described her as ""courageous"" as he spoke for the first time about her imminent resignation.

""The problem is not Theresa May... the problem is the situation to work within the realities of the Good Friday Agreement and the UK not wanting to stay members of the customs union and not wanting to stay as members of the internal market and all those red lines, it was almost impossible to come up with something that could command a majority in the House of Commons.""

David Cameron says he feels 'desperately sorry' for Theresa May

And while people are quick to judge her as the worst prime minister ever - see my previous column - I would caution about what could come next.

Allies of the prime minister tell me that she blocked a ""no-deal"" Brexit because of the implications it could have for the United Kingdom and the break up of the union. As the prime minister of the Conservative Party and Unionist Party, Mrs May wouldn't do anything that might hastened the calls for a border poll.

Because while Mrs May got there late in the day, the principle of compromise that she spoke of is the only route through the Brexit impasse. It is about to be in even shorter supply under a new Conservative prime minister.

In the imminent race to replace Theresa May, the party will polarise further into the no-deal versus deal camps. And whoever wants to win the leadership knows only too well that supporting a hard Brexit is the closest route to Tory members' hearts.

Image: From top left to bottom right: Matt Hancock, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, Rory Stewart, Esther McVey, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid could all run to be the next prime minister

As one MP said to me in the hours after Mrs May announced she was standing down as leader on 7 June: ""Nothing changes. Not in Europe. Not mathematically in parliament. The only thing which will happen now is an election. Which will change nothing.""

Another Conservative prime minister brought down by Europe, the wings of the party remain as irreconcilable as ever. Her Tory hardliners will only accept a ""clean Brexit"".

Parliament will not accept a no-deal Brexit. If the future prime minister tries to take the UK out with no-deal on 31 October, will parliament try to collapse the government?

If the new prime minister chooses to delay Brexit further, will ""spartan"" Brexiteers on their own benches try to do the same?

So we end the month of May with the prime minister poised to stand down. But Brexit is a problem delayed not resolved. And the battle to come will be bloodier still.","Theresa May was broken by Brexit, it is likely to break her successor tooTheresa May was broken by Brexit, it is likely to break her successor tooTheresa May goes back into Number 10 after her emotional resignation speechIt has been a political career defined by not showing emotion.

Theresa May shows her human side - but it's too late

Theresa May and husband Philip after the statement at Downing Street

It was an acute flash of searing emotion from a prime minister who, by her own admission, rarely wears her heart on her sleeve.

A cracking of the voice and a tightening of the face as the stress and strain Theresa May has mostly kept captive for the last three years came gushing out.

A moment that surely cut to the core of even the most hardened of Westminster political animals.

One wonders how long Mrs May has had this speech ready.

She began by laying out her objectives in the job: to turn the UK into a country that works for everyone, and to deliver Brexit.

By anyone's standards, she has failed on both counts.

The highs and lows of Theresa May's premiership.

Leaving the European Union has turned this administration into a zombie government, unable or unwilling to pass even the most uncontroversial of legislation.

Brexit is at a standstill and will likely go no further until a new prime minister is selected.

Compromise was a theme of the speech. But for this prime minister, her attempts at compromise came too late and when they did, only served to push people apart rather than bring them together.

She began her premiership by steering the country towards a cleaner break with the EU, declaring famously that ""Brexit means Brexit"".

When that ran into the ground, an attempt at compromise with pro-EU elements of her own party and Labour inflamed an already febrile situation.

Theresa May resigns - full statement

Of course, a new leader will not immediately solve that Brexit paralysis.

Mrs May said her successor will need to ""find consensus"" and that her party should be ""decent, moderate and patriotic"" - a sign perhaps that she believes the next prime minister will need to work with all MPs, rather than pander to Tory Brexiteers.

The Tory party's almost certain crushing at the European elections at the hands of Nigel Farage may make that impossible.

Serving the UK 'honour of my life'

Mrs May did point to some domestic achievements - saying the party is ending austerity, protecting the environment and investing in the NHS.

In the long run though, it will be hard to point to any totemic policy shifts that will be pinned to this prime minister.

Much of her domestic agenda, designed to turn the Tories into a party that once again spoke to the working classes, junked after the 2017 election disaster.

When Theresa May announced she was standing to be prime minister, she said she was ""not a showy politician"" and did not ""gossip"" or ""tour the television studios"" but would ""get on with the job in front of me"".

That was meant as a positive, a pitch that Mrs May would rise above the tabloid tittle-tattle that so often dominates Westminster and focus on the detail.

In the end though, this straight-laced nature has contributed to her downfall.

A prime minister unable to make the emotional case for her Brexit deal. Unable to win people over to her way of thinking or bring them along with her political journey.

And in the end, a leader unable to lead.

History may be kinder to Theresa May than the headline writers of today. A hard working politician lacking in the fleet of foot empathetic firepower needed to deal with Brexit.

In many ways, this speech was emblematic of Mrs May's premiership - rigid but dignified, lacking in emotion until it was too late.","Theresa May shows her human side - but it's too lateTheresa May shows her human side - but it's too lateTheresa May and husband Philip after the statement at Downing StreetIt was an acute flash of searing emotion from a prime minister who, by her own admission, rarely wears her heart on her sleeve.

Sort Brexit and win an election: Five things on next PM's to-do list

A number of Tory MPs are poised to launch bids to replace Theresa May

From cabinet ministers to backbenchers, the likes of Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, and Esther McVey are formally declaring their intention to stand for the Tory leadership.

There will be many more.

But whoever takes over from bleary-eyed Theresa May as prime minister - tear today, gone tomorrow - will face the same Brexit crisis that has brought about her downfall.

The new prime minister's first problem will be that the parliamentary arithmetic won't have changed since Theresa May's humiliating Commons defeats earlier this year.

A Brexiteer prime minister could still be thwarted by a pro-Remain House of Commons.

The next problem is Brussels.

Renegotiating Theresa May's Brexit deal is easier said than done.

For that reason, a new leader - almost certainly a Brexiteer, with Boris Johnson as the runaway favourite - makes a ""no-deal"" Brexit more likely.

To the alarm of pro-Remain MPs, many of the potential Tory leadership contenders, would be prepared to leave the EU with no deal.

They include Mr Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss and Esther McVey.

Former Remainers who have not ruled out no-deal include Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid.

Backing the prime minister's deal - so far - and against no-deal are Michael Gove, Rory Stewart, Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd.

Of course, whoever takes over from Theresa May won't be the first PM to inherit a crisis.

Image: Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid could be among the leading contenders to become the next PM

Many have, in wartime and times of grave economic crisis.

Those prime ministers who arrive in Downing Street after winning a general election usually enjoy a honeymoon period, often lasting several months.

Mrs May's successor is unlikely to enjoy that luxury.

Whitehall insiders suggest that to make Brexit work, the new PM will need better personal skills than Theresa May.

More ""clubbable"", they suggest, both with Tory MPs and even with the likes of the Cognac-quaffing Jean-Claude Juncker and his successor.

But for now, the Tories' problem is simple: new leader, same Brexit.

Image: Some MPs have said they will resign if Boris Johnson becomes leader

So here are five things in the new prime minister's in-tray:



:: Sort Brexit

Good luck with that! The new prime minister will inherit the same parliamentary arithmetic, and a hardline Brexiteer like Mr Johnson could face bigger pro-Remain rebellions on the Tory side than Mrs May has suffered. The new prime minister would almost certainly jettison Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill. But a divisive figure like the former foreign secretary could find the House of Commons even more obstructive than before.

:: Make post-Brexit Britain prosper

Liam Fox is optimistic about trade deals outside the EU. Not everyone shares his enthusiasm, however, with the protectionist Donald Trump in the White House hardly helping. Job losses and closures at Honda, British Steel and now Thomas Cook are worrying developments and reflect business' lack of confidence in the present uncertainty.

Leadsom resignation: I cannot support the Brexit bill

:: Heal the Tory wounds

The new leader would be wise to appoint a balanced cabinet with Leavers and Remainers, rather than pack the top table with Brexiteer cronies. Some Tory MPs, including newly-promoted cabinet minister Rory Stewart and arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve, have suggested they'll quit the party if Mr Johnson becomes leader. If he doesn't make the shortlist of two candidates voted on by party members, however, there will be a vicious grassroots backlash from the elderly, pro-Brexit activists who make up the vast majority of Conservative Party members.

:: Heal the divisions in the country

The mood has become ugly. More and more politicians are suffering vicious online abuse and physical assaults. The European elections have seen a huge protest vote against the two big parties and the rise of far-right extremism. Incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia - and allegations against the two big parties - have reached alarming levels. Brexit has poisoned political debate.

:: Win an election

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act dictates that the next election is not until 2022, but the new leader will be desperate to try and win an overall Commons majority to break the current deadlock and avoid having to be at the mercy of the pesky Democratic Unionists. A string of defeats on Brexit legislation in the Commons could also bring about an early election. Labour wants an election, so don't rule it out in the autumn or next spring.

British deal with US over Chagos Islands not its finest hour

Harold Wilson did a deal with the US for missiles to be based on Diego Garcia

It was not Britain's finest hour. In the mid-60s Harold Wilson wanted Polaris missiles, the US sought a base in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

A deal was done. Britain was to detach a bunch of islands from other oceanic territory and together with the Americans build a military base on one of them, Diego Garcia.

There was a catch though. Between 1,500 and 2,000 catches. People who had lived there, for a few generations at least.

In a dispatch revealed by Wikileaks decades later one British official described them as ""Tarzans and Men Fridays"".

There were efforts to entice them off the islands, including apparently an effort to kill their pet dogs. And through a mixture of subterfuge and coercion they were cleared off the archipelago.

They have lived ever since as second class citizens in Mauritius and some of them in the UK.

Because they had not owned property at least on the islands, living in accommodation given them by absentee landlords, instead their compensation if any was less than generous.

Image: Up to 2,000 people were moved off the island

They have campaigned ever since for the right to return. It has been a tortuously protracted battle but one that is now beginning to pay off.

And they have gathered more and more support in higher and higher places.

Welcoming the news from the UN General Assembly, MP Andrew Rosindell, for instance tweeted: ""The outer islands of Chagos are a long way from Diego Garcia and that is where the dispossessed Chagosian people would like to return to - it is feasible for this to happen and the UK should end this shameful episode and allow them to return to their homeland!""

The vote in the UN GA is not binding but it puts greater pressure on the UK to hand over the Chagos Islands, including Diego Garcia to Mauritius.

The UK insists the archipelago was never a part of the Mauritius, because it was carved off before Mauritian independence.

Britain says its sovereignty goes back to 1814 and points out that the decision in 1965 to divide it from other territory was agreed with Mauritius in return for fishing and other rights.

And the UK insists the continued existence of the military base is vital for allied interests, to ""combat conflict terrorism, drugs, crime and piracy"" in the words of British ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce.

Air offensives on Iraq and Afghanistan have been launched from the base and it is thought to play an important role as a listening station for intelligence purposes.

Britain is not about to surrender its claim and let the islanders return. But critics say it shows the UK's waning diplomatic influence and America's too.

Image: A demonstration took place in London in 2008 demanding the islands be handed back

European allies who might in the past have supported the British case abstained. Only Hungary, Israel, the US, Australia and the Maldives voted with the UK.

For all the emotion surrounding the case, legally it boils down to two competing arguments.

Britain's critics say it is a question of decolonisation, a bit of unfinished British imperial business receiving its just desserts.

The UK says it is a matter of sovereignty that should be resolved bilaterally between itself and Mauritius and the vote sets an unfortunate precedent.

If the UN were able to adjudicate issues of sovereignty around the world by general assembly vote it is argued any number of territorial disputes could be reopened with the potential for renewed conflict and destabilisation.","British deal with US over Chagos Islands not its finest hourBritish deal with US over Chagos Islands not its finest hourHarold Wilson did a deal with the US for missiles to be based on Diego GarciaIt was not Britain's finest hour.

Theresa May 'isolated and lonely' as party tears itself to pieces

Theresa May faced a lonely Prime Minister's Questions with notable gaps on the front and backbenches

The rumour mill in Westminster is like nothing else.

Murmurs over coffee became excited chatter over drinks in the Commons tea rooms and bars as MPs openly discussed when, not if, the prime minister would be forced out of Downing Street.

After a disastrous Prime Minister's questions session in which Theresa May was challenged angrily by her own side over Northern Ireland it emerged that cabinet ministers felt they had been betrayed over her new Brexit plan.

""What she has presented is not what was discussed in cabinet"", one source said, adding that once ministers had taken a look at the bill they knew the changes were not the ones they had grudgingly agreed to just a day earlier.

Mrs May was already facing the prospect of her backbench MPs changing leadership rules to force her out of office, now her closest team of senior ministers were on the warpath too.

Meanwhile, she was facing down her own side in the House of Commons, angry over a list of 10 promises she had made to try and win Labour support for her Brexit bill.

""I don't think I would have been standing here at the despatch box and been in receipt of some of the comments I have been in receipt of from colleagues and across the house if I didn't believe in what I was doing"", the prime minister told staunch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.

He had asked her the question which had been echoing around Westminster since her speech on Brexit yesterday: Why is she persisting when it is obvious her plan doesn't have enough support?

Because support for her premiership and her Brexit bill has been slipping gradually away since she lost the last meaningful vote.

Image: Jacob Rees-Mogg asked why May was persisting with her unpopular Brexit deal

The steady trickle, however, had become a flood overnight - resulting in an isolated and lonely Prime Minister facing the opposition for Prime Minister's Questions with empty spaces not just on her backbenches but on her front bench too.

A clutch of her most senior pro-Brexit colleagues were cloistered in another room in the palace as Mrs May battled through an exchange with Jeremy Corbyn on school funding and an even more painful onslaught from her own side about Northern Ireland.

There was no wall of noise when she arrived in the chamber, and even less when she stood to speak.

At one point a group of previously supportive Conservative MPs took to opening their mouths but not actually cheering, they just couldn't bring themselves to.

As if a better illustration of the deep divisions in the party were needed, Dr Phillip Lee stood to ask for a second referendum vote, prompting his colleague Robert Halfon, just a few seats down the same benches, to shout ""no way, never"".

Labour MPs sat quietly, watching a party usually so good at keeping rivalries behind closed doors openly tear itself to pieces.

Mrs May took question after question from backbench MPs staunchly opposed to her Brexit plans, but not on her policy to leave the EU.

Instead their frustration spilled over after a newspaper article suggested the prime minister blocked a chance to ensure British soldiers serving in Northern Ireland would not be prosecuted.

Impassioned responses were met with calm explanation, until they weren't - Mrs May finally cracked and snapped back at Tory MP Johnny Mercer that her thoughts on the matter should be blatantly obvious by now.

Image: MPs are now openly discussing when, not if, Mrs May would be forced from Downing Street

Fast forward a few hours and as whispers that cabinet ministers were seeking meetings with the prime minister grew louder, backbench Conservatives began to gather for a meeting to decide whether or not to force another confidence vote.

Against the current rules, any new vote would require a big change so far resisted by the influential 1922 committee.

First the executive committee went back and forth over the decision, calling in restless MPs before dismissing them all again.

Theresa May 'isolated and lonely' as party tears itself to pieces

Theresa May faced a lonely Prime Minister's Questions with notable gaps on the front and backbenches

The rumour mill in Westminster is like nothing else.

Murmurs over coffee became excited chatter over drinks in the Commons tea rooms and bars as MPs openly discussed when, not if, the prime minister would be forced out of Downing Street.

After a disastrous Prime Minister's questions session in which Theresa May was challenged angrily by her own side over Northern Ireland it emerged that cabinet ministers felt they had been betrayed over her new Brexit plan.

""What she has presented is not what was discussed in cabinet"", one source said, adding that once ministers had taken a look at the bill they knew the changes were not the ones they had grudgingly agreed to just a day earlier.

Mrs May was already facing the prospect of her backbench MPs changing leadership rules to force her out of office, now her closest team of senior ministers were on the warpath too.

Meanwhile, she was facing down her own side in the House of Commons, angry over a list of 10 promises she had made to try and win Labour support for her Brexit bill.

""I don't think I would have been standing here at the despatch box and been in receipt of some of the comments I have been in receipt of from colleagues and across the house if I didn't believe in what I was doing"", the prime minister told staunch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.

He had asked her the question which had been echoing around Westminster since her speech on Brexit yesterday: Why is she persisting when it is obvious her plan doesn't have enough support?

Because support for her premiership and her Brexit bill has been slipping gradually away since she lost the last meaningful vote.

The steady trickle, however, had become a flood overnight - resulting in an isolated and lonely Prime Minister facing the opposition for Prime Minister's Questions with empty spaces not just on her backbenches but on her front bench too.

A clutch of her most senior pro-Brexit colleagues were cloistered in another room in the palace as Mrs May battled through an exchange with Jeremy Corbyn on school funding and an even more painful onslaught from her own side about Northern Ireland.

There was no wall of noise when she arrived in the chamber, and even less when she stood to speak.

At one point a group of previously supportive Conservative MPs took to opening their mouths but not actually cheering, they just couldn't bring themselves to.

As if a better illustration of the deep divisions in the party were needed, Dr Phillip Lee stood to ask for a second referendum vote, prompting his colleague Robert Halfon, just a few seats down the same benches, to shout ""no way, never"".

Labour MPs sat quietly, watching a party usually so good at keeping rivalries behind closed doors openly tear itself to pieces.

Mrs May took question after question from backbench MPs staunchly opposed to her Brexit plans, but not on her policy to leave the EU.

Instead their frustration spilled over after a newspaper article suggested the prime minister blocked a chance to ensure British soldiers serving in Northern Ireland would not be prosecuted.

Impassioned responses were met with calm explanation, until they weren't - Mrs May finally cracked and snapped back at Tory MP Johnny Mercer that her thoughts on the matter should be blatantly obvious by now.

Fast forward a few hours and as whispers that cabinet ministers were seeking meetings with the prime minister grew louder, backbench Conservatives began to gather for a meeting to decide whether or not to force another confidence vote.

Against the current rules, any new vote would require a big change so far resisted by the influential 1922 committee.

First the executive committee went back and forth over the decision, calling in restless MPs before dismissing them all again.

Then the chief whip turned up to meet with the senior committee members, before turning on his heels just two minutes later after telling them the prime minister would be out campaigning for the EU elections tomorrow and suggested her MPs do the same.

160,Royal Mail delivers dividend disappointment to posties,Ian King,"Royal Mail has delivered disappointing news today to the 400,000 or so private investors and employees who own its shares by announcing a cut in the dividend.

The company, which handed 913 free shares to all of its full-time employees when it was privatised in October 2013, said that, from 2019-20, it intended to pay a full year dividend of 15p-a-share.

That compares with the 25p-a-share pay-out for the 2018-19 financial year.

The decision marks something of a turnaround for the company.

Peter Long, who was Royal Mail's chairman until he stepped down last September, told investors in last year's annual report and accounts: ""The board is committed to our progressive dividend policy.""

A progressive dividend policy is City jargon for continually raising the dividend over time.

Those shareholders have experienced mixed fortunes since Royal Mail floated on the stock market.

The shares, which were sold by the coalition government at 330p each, briefly touched 632p as recently as May last year but have since come rattling back all the way to Tuesday night's closing price of 211.4p.

On a more positive note, as Mr Long noted in last year's annual results, a Royal Mail employee receiving a full allocation of shares at privatisation ""will have received well over £863 in dividends before tax since privatisation"" - which does not include this year's pay-out.

So what has changed?

The answer seems to be that Rico Back, who succeeded Moya Greene as chief executive in September last year, has had a chance to look at the business in detail and decided that Royal Mail now needs a greater share of the profits it generates than its owners do.

Image: Royal Mail is introducing parcel posting boxes

He said today: ""Royal Mail is one of the most widely held stocks in the FTSE [350].

""The board appreciates the support of our shareholders, including our postmen and women who have received free shares.

""We very much understand the importance of the dividend to all our shareholders.

""Our decision to rebase the dividend and change the policy is not one that we have taken lightly.

""In doing so, we have sought to find the appropriate balance between investing in the future sustainability of our business and shareholder returns.""

The move does represent something of a risk to a chief executive who received a £6m 'golden hello' on taking the job, despite already working for Royal Mail, whose remuneration report was subsequently voted down by nearly three-quarters of shareholders at last year's annual meeting.

Around a fifth of Royal Mail's shares are owned by retail investors and employees.

Yet Mr Back has clearly decided there is no alternative.

Today's results saw Royal Mail report a 14% rise in full year pre-tax profits, to £241m, on the back of growth in its parcels business and its operations overseas.

But adjusted to take account of £133m worth of so-called 'transformation costs', or reorganising and modernising the business, profits fell by 30% to £398m.

That left earnings per share (the company's earnings divided by the number of shares in issue) at just 30.5p - meaning that, in the jargon, the dividend was only just covered by Royal Mail's earnings.

It came as Mr Back unveiled plans to invest £1.8bn during the next five years in the UK's postal service.

That money will be spent on turning Royal Mail into a 'parcels-led business' - with the aim of growing the volume of parcels handled by Royal Mail at more than 4-5% a year and revenues from parcels at more than a compound average of 5% a year.

UK parcel volumes grew during the most recent financial year by 8% and revenues by 7%.

Specifically, the company is planning to build three new fully-automated parcel hubs and to introduce separate van delivery for next day and larger parcels, with between of its 200-300 bigger delivery offices equipped to handle these.

It says that, with the new parcel hubs and separate van deliveries in place by 2023, it should enable consumers and small business customers in most parts of the company to receive two deliveries a day.

Other changes planned include the roll-out of 1,400 'parcel posting boxes', deliveries to 'locker banks' and, for the first time, Royal Mail will begin collecting returns from consumers at their home.

The big question investors will have is whether the group will enjoy sufficiently strong returns on this investment.

The plan is nothing if not ambitious.

Image: Letter revenues and volumes are declining rapidly

Royal Mail is hoping that, by 2023-24, 70% of its revenues will be coming from parcels.

Given the likely growth in parcel volumes, due to the explosion in e-commerce, that is certainly possible.

But it will still represent a huge change from the current situation.

The latest results show Royal Mail still to be slightly more dependent on UK letters, from which revenues were £4bn, compared with revenues of £3.5bn from UK parcels.

But letters revenues and volumes are declining rapidly, both due to the increasing migration of communications online and also to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which limited the amount of marketing communications or 'junk mail' that companies can post.

UK letter revenues were down 6% during the year while UK parcel revenues rose by 7%.

At those rates, UK parcel revenues will overtake UK letter revenues in 2020-21.

The early verdict from the market appears mixed.

The shares rallied by 5% today, implying that the dividend cut had already been priced in, but after a 7% fall on Tuesday they still remain down by 4.5% over the two days as a whole.

But doing nothing was not an option for Royal Mail.

In the meantime, lest it be forgotten, this is no longer a solely British business.

GLS, the international arm of Royal Mail that was previously run by Mr Back before he succeeded Ms Greene, is the fastest-growing part of the company.

If Mr Back can replicate in Royal Mail's domestic business the success that he enjoyed at GLS, shareholders will quickly forget the dividend cut announced today.","Those shareholders have experienced mixed fortunes since Royal Mail floated on the stock market.

162,Why China produced more steel in two years than the UK did in 150,Ed Conway,"Why China produced more steel in two years than the UK did in 150

Why China produced more steel in two years than the UK did in 150

Sky's economics editor Ed Conway explains the demise of the steel industry in the UK.

Here are two surprising facts which between them help explain why the UK steel industry seems to be in what looks like a perma-slump.

The first is that in the past two years (to be precise, the past 22 months) China has manufactured more steel than Britain has since the height of the Industrial Revolution in 1870.

Try, if you can, to get your head round that.

In the months since the last general election China has produced more steel than Britain - the country where modern steel manufacturing was invented - has produced. Ever.

This fact is all the more startling when you note that until relatively recently China didn't actually make all that much steel and used to get most of its steel from overseas.

But over the past 20 years it has ramped up steel production to astonishing levels.

Last year alone it produced just shy of a billion tonnes of steel - something that took Britain about a century.

The European Union has tariffs and anti-dumping rules which are designed to prevent this wave of steel from flooding its markets, but such a massive surge in production has posed a massive challenge for British producers, who struggle to compete on price and quantity.

It is no wonder the steel industry has mainly been kept afloat over the past few years thanks to repeated injections of state aid.

Image: China has sharply ramped up steel production over the last 20 years

This week is hardly the first time the government has had to consider whether to bail out a key part of the industry.

Now on the basis of all that you might have assumed that the steel industry was one of the poorest performers in the UK economy.

And in one respect you'd be right: today overall UK economic output is around 77% bigger than it was in 1990; the output of the steel industry is around 46% smaller.

Philip Booth, research director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, questions whether the taxpayer should bail out the steel industry.

The number of people working in the sector has fallen from over 300,000 in the early 1970s to barely more than 30,000 today.

However, that brings us to the second intriguing fact about the steel industry, for when you look across the board of all UK sectors, there are few which have increased their productivity as much in the past couple of decades.

For all its image as a failing sector, the steel industry produces more bang-for-buck than most other parts of UK plc.

In part the explanation for this is in the previous paragraph: output has fallen, but the number of workers it's taken to produce that output has fallen at an even greater rate.

That is scant consolation for the hundreds of thousands of workers who lost their jobs over that period.

But it is a useful rejoinder.

The steel industry is more lean and advanced than ever before, producing more steel for less effort.

And yet it is still struggling, amid competition from China, environmental costs and the difficulties of competing against foreign counterparts who get constant support from their governments.","Why China produced more steel in two years than the UK did in 150Why China produced more steel in two years than the UK did in 150Sky's economics editor Ed Conway explains the demise of the steel industry in the UK.

164,May's latest Brexit promises have done little to convince MPs,Kate Mccann,"Theresa May said she had 'tried everything' to get her deal through

""This speech isn't part of a box-set"", the prime minister's spokesman told journalists, just hours before Theresa May took to the stage for a speech that felt very much like the final episode in a long-running series.

Standing in the atrium of a business in central London, watched on by six floors of workers who she occasionally looked up at almost pleadingly, Mrs May said she had ""tried everything"" to get her deal through.

""I offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like,"" she said in a rare moment of personal reflection.

MPs were already frustrated that the prime minister had chosen to make her new Brexit offer in an office block instead of in the House of Commons and some were not cheered by the changes she outlined.

One Conservative MP who previously backed Mrs May tweeted he would not be supporting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill again before she had even sat down.

May: I've listened to calls for a second vote

At the heart of the new offer is a set of 10 changes, carefully designed to address concerns on both the Remain and Brexit supporting sides of the fence.

The problem is that in trying to please both sides, Mrs May could end up pleasing nobody at all.

Her offer of a vote on a second referendum if MPs support her bill through the initial stages in parliament might appeal to Labour MPs who want the chance to reverse Brexit, but it is a red line many Conservatives will not cross.

Image: The PM delivered her speech from an office block

Likewise, offering close alignment on goods and agri-foods may help persuade those who are worried about the Northern Irish border but it will do nothing for MPs who fear the UK will be so closely tied that independent trade deals will be impossible.

She urged MPs to look carefully at the new deal and read the bill before setting their faces against it.

""I have compromised, I ask others to compromise too,"" she said, warning that the British people will not suffer the ""corrosive"" debate around Brexit for much longer.

But just minutes after the speech, Steve Baker, one of those Mrs May really must convince, branded it ""muddled"" - while the Liberal Democrats said the second referendum offer does not go far enough.

""The biggest problem with Britain today is its politics,"" Mrs May warned.

The problem is many of her MPs do not agree; they think the biggest problem is the prime minister herself.","""I offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like,"" she said in a rare moment of personal reflection.

Likewise, offering close alignment on goods and agri-foods may help persuade those who are worried about the Northern Irish border but it will do nothing for MPs who fear the UK will be so closely tied that independent trade deals will be impossible.

She urged MPs to look carefully at the new deal and read the bill before setting their faces against it.

""I have compromised, I ask others to compromise too,"" she said, warning that the British people will not suffer the ""corrosive"" debate around Brexit for much longer.

But just minutes after the speech, Steve Baker, one of those Mrs May really must convince, branded it ""muddled"" - while the Liberal Democrats said the second referendum offer does not go far enough.

""The biggest problem with Britain today is its politics,"" Mrs May warned.

The problem is many of her MPs do not agree; they think the biggest problem is the prime minister herself.","""I offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like,"" she said in a rare moment of personal reflection.
MPs were already frustrated that the prime minister had chosen to make her new Brexit offer in an office block instead of in the House of Commons and some were not cheered by the changes she outlined.
The problem is that in trying to please both sides, Mrs May could end up pleasing nobody at all.
She urged MPs to look carefully at the new deal and read the bill before setting their faces against it.

Beyond the protests, BP starts a new era - but how far does it go?

In a deal heralded as a ""turning point"" for the fossil fuels industry, oil giant BP has accepted that its plans for the future must now embrace the terms of the Paris climate change agreement.

A resolution, saying that the company must put the agreement at the heart of its future strategy, was passed with more than 99% of the votes.

BP's chairman, Helge Lund, said a transition to a low-carbon economy was ""in the best interests"" of the company.

He also said that the company accepted scientific proof of climate change and now wanted to play ""a leading role"" in the global move away from fossil fuels.

But he added that BP needed to follow a ""dual challenge"" by meeting the world's growing energy needs while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr Lund was speaking at the company's annual general meeting, held in Aberdeen.

Despite considerable security, with around 30 guards deployed into the exhibition centre where the meeting was held, it was still held up by a demonstration from climate change activists.

Around half-a-dozen protesters were removed from the meeting after setting off alarms and shouting ""this is a crime scene"".

Their protest started just moments after the company's chief executive, Bob Dudley, had started speaking.

The expelled protesters then joined a demonstration outside the exhibition centre, shouting demands for ""climate justice"".

Image: Activist Kate Whitaker says protesters don't believe a thing BP says about climate change

One of them, Kate Whitaker, told Sky News that ""we don't believe anything they say about climate change"" and accused the company of ""greenwashing"" by making vague promises about environmental responsibility.

Mr Lund agreed that the world is ""on an unsustainable path"" but denied claims of ""greenwashing"".

He told shareholders that climate change ""is at the top of the agenda at every board meeting we have"".

After pausing to allow the protesters to be taken away, Mr Dudley went on to say that BP wanted to be ""transparent about the future"" and that it was ""essential to retain the trust of shareholders"".

While the AGM was asked to approve a variety of resolutions, most of the time was spent on discussing just two - both related to climate change.

The first, which mandates BP to embrace the Paris agreement into its plans, was put forward by a group of institutional investors, backed by the company and received an overwhelming level of support.

However, a second resolution, which would have imposed much stricter controls on the firm, was rejected, even though a similar rule was recently adopted by BP's great rival, Shell.

Most investors said this second resolution was too onerous and inflexible, although it was backed by more than 8% of shareholders - not a huge percentage, but certainly enough for BP to take it seriously.

""While 8% support may not sound like a lot, a lower level of support was enough to force Shell to U-turn on target-setting,"" said Jeanne Martin from the shareholder activist group, ShareAction.

""There's clearly an appetite for BP to set emissions reduction targets for its clients' products, with some of BP's largest investors already announcing that they would call for this if BP failed to deliver a Paris-consistent strategy in a year's time.""

But there may also be a more profound point here - a demonstration that investors are turning away from companies if they don't have a strategy that allies with international climate change legislation.

Image: Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Hermes EOS, says investors are increasingly concerned about climate change

After all, the resolution that earned such support was put forward by some of the most familiar names in UK investing, including Aviva, Hermes and even the Church of England.

Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Hermes EOS, said: ""We're seeing rising concern in wider society, but also with investors, that investing consistently with the Paris goals is the only way to invest safely.

""Being able to deliver that strategy has gone from being part of the preparation to a transition to a low-carbon economy, to becoming a commitment to deliver it.""

The curiosity is that almost everyone at this AGM - protesters, investors and company officials - were saying roughly the same thing: that climate change is a threat that needs to be addressed; that the status quo is unacceptable.

All agreed that BP needs a new strategy - that the company needs to change.

168,Jamie Oliver closures: Why Britain is losing its appetite for casual dining,Ian King,"A report this week said 750 outlets had closed in the year to March

The collapse of Jamie Oliver's restaurants empire is merely the latest and most high-profile continuation of a trend that was established in the eating-out sector two years ago.

Jamie's Italian and Barbecoa now join a roll-call that, during 2019, has seen Boparan Restaurant Group announce plans to close around a third of its Ed's Easy Diner and Giraffe outlets and Patisserie Valerie close more than 70 outlets since unearthing accounting problems late last year.

The Restaurant Group, one of the biggest quoted companies in the sector, is also in the process of closing some of its more poorly-performing Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito outlets or converting them to branches of Wagamama, which it recently acquired.

To this list can be added some of the big-name casualties of 2018, which saw the likes of Carluccio's, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Byron, Handmade Burger Co, Strada and Prezzo all closing sites.

Indeed, the attrition rate appears to be accelerating, with the advisory firms CGA and Alix Partners yesterday publishing a report suggesting that 750 outlets have closed during the year to the end of March.

The problem has a number of causes.

The short-term difficulty is that restaurants are buckling from the same pressures afflicting high street retailers, such as higher rents, crushing business rates - especially in London - and rising costs, due to food price inflation as a result of the weaker pound and higher wage bills, reflecting increases in the National Living Wage.

None of these, though, are especially new factors and have been in place for more than a year.

Perhaps the bigger surprise is that they continue to afflict the sector.

Image: Burger chain Byron has survived after shutting 21 restaurants last year

That suggests the restaurant closures seen during the last two years have not gone far enough in mitigating the main headwind facing the industry - namely that the UK has too many restaurants competing for too few customers.

The over-supply stems in part from the fact that private equity firms, with plenty of funds to deploy, have poured money into the casual dining sector in recent years and been quick to encourage the rapid roll-out of formats that had appeared successful in one or two outlets.

Quite often, these formats had enjoyed initial success in London, but that did not guarantee success in other towns and cities across the country and particularly where the format was hurriedly replicated.

A good example here is Byron, the private equity-backed burger chain, although it has at least survived after closing 21 restaurants last year and receiving a £10m cash injection from investors in February this year.

Another example of a format that did not enjoy universal success once rolled-out nationwide, having enjoyed initial success in the capital, was the upmarket pizza chain Franco Manca.

Particular segments of the market that are over-crowded include the mid-market casual sector, where - when the downturn kicked in at the end of 2017 - the likes of Bella Pizza, Zizzi, Ask Italian, Café Rouge, Carluccio's and Wagamama had all been duking it out from more than 100 sites apiece and PizzaExpress and Prezzo were each trading from more than 200 sites.

This was also the segment of the market in which Jamie's Italian sat.

The over-saturation was not just in individual segments of the market, though, but has also been geographic.

It appears to have been particularly pronounced in the south of England.

The Alix Partners and CGA report suggests that 2.8% of all restaurants in the south have closed during the last 12 months, compared with 1.3% in London and a closure rate of just 0.4% in the north of England.

That may not necessarily be due to over-saturation of restaurants.

It may also point to the fact that consumers outside London and the south-east, spared the onerous cost of housing in those parts of the country, have more money to spend on eating out.

Image: Carluccio's is cited as an example of chains that were slow to update menus to reflect changing tastes

Other factors that may be at play include a failure on the part of restaurant operators to respond to changing tastes - in particular among millennials, the younger consumers who eat out most frequently - who in general place a greater emphasis on provenance and who are more likely to look for healthier options on restaurant menus such as low calorie, vegetarian, vegan and allergen-aware dishes.

Any big restaurant chain that fails to address these consumer demands immediately starts at a disadvantage.

Many of the bigger chains - Carluccio's is often cited by industry insiders as an example - were slow to update or refresh their menus and came a cropper as a result.

Changing tastes also appear to have contributed to the failure of an increasing number of Britain's curry houses which, according to the Asian Catering Federation, have been closing at the rate of two a week, although other factors have also been at play here, including stricter immigration rules on accepting chefs from Asia.

Moreover, some restaurant operators appeared to be putting quantity over quality.

Jamie's Italian, which purported to be offering a premium product, was accused of this after it emerged - following a Food Standards Agency investigation - that it was using the same meat supplier, Russell Hume, as the considerably less expensive JD Wetherspoon pub chain.

It is not the case that the entire casual dining sector is drowning in over-capacity.

The number of pubs has collapsed in the face of an onslaught of cheap supermarket booze and after the introduction of smoking bans in Scotland in March 2006 and in England and Wales in July 2007.

Yet those pubs that have remained in business have raised their game considerably and, in particular, in the quality of their food offerings.

Image: Greggs is among the brands that have been trading strongly

There seems little doubt that Britain's pubs are now winning market share at the expense of some restaurant operators.

So, too, are those businesses with a clear value proposition.

Among those trading particularly strongly at present include the Greggs bakery chain, the Subway sandwich chain, McDonald's and Pizza Hut.

The bigger worry for the entire sector must be that the whole casual dining phenomenon, an established part of British social life for the last 25-30 years, is weakening.

The rapid rise of home delivery services like Deliveroo and Uber Eats, or apps like Just Eat that facilitate home delivery, represent a huge threat to the sector because, in the case of Deliveroo or Uber Eats, a restaurateur is effectively contracting out, to a third party, the valuable and vital relationship that they have with their customers.

A customer who has a poor experience in a restaurant can be placated by an owner or manager knocking a few items off the bill; a customer who has a bad experience that they have ordered via Deliveroo or Uber Eats may just opt for buying dishes from another restaurant via the service in future.

The vast sums being piled into this sector, particularly since Amazon participated in Deliveroo's latest $575m funding round, mean that competitive pressure is only going to grow.","Any big restaurant chain that fails to address these consumer demands immediately starts at a disadvantage.

170,Facial recognition technology: Who watches the watchers?,Rowland Manthorpe,"There are concerns about how police will use facial recognition technology

We are heading, with great speed, towards an epochal moment in the history of computing.

Until very recently, computers could do what a human might describe as ""read"" - they could take in information, as long as it was presented in a language they understood.

Now, thanks to artificial intelligence, computers are learning how to ""see"".

They can ingest, filter and store the entire visual universe, whether or not it has been rendered in an appropriate format.

Before, computers could only see QR codes. Now, increasingly, life is a QR code.

The significance of this can hardly be underestimated. Under the untiring, telescopic eyes of seeing computers, every fragment of experience can be digested and regurgitated for human use - or, to be more precise, for the use of the humans with access to the cameras.

That's why a current legal challenge against police use of facial recognition is an immensely significant moment.

South Wales Police is being taken to court by a man whose image was captured by a facial recognition system as he was shopping in Cardiff.

As the barristers on both sides made clear in court, it is very explicitly intended to set a precedent for automated facial recognition - that is, mass or bulk facial recognition, which surveys an entire crowd in order to pick out certain faces.

The issues are wide-ranging and complex, but two stand out as central.

First, does this technology breach the human right to privacy?

Faces are biometric identifiers, as unique in their own way as fingerprints or DNA. But unlike those attributes, faces can be swept up without consent, as they have been by South Wales Police in Cardiff and the Metropolitan Police at the Notting Hill Carnival in London.

The government argues that facial recognition is less intrusive than DNA or fingerprints because ""many people's faces are on public display all the time.""

But that same point might be made in reverse; the fact that faces are ""on display"" means they need extra protection, if the ability to recognise them at scale is not to be abused.

The second issue concerns the detail of the systems. As they are currently deployed, facial recognition algorithms work by matching faces against a database of photos, known as a watchlist.

Watchlists have contained images of serious criminals, but they have also held images of people with mental health issues - with action then taken by the police as a result. Their administration is vague in the extreme.

So, while this hearing is prompted by a brand new technology, many of the most crucial questions have nothing to do with computers or algorithms.

When is each watchlist used? Who goes on it? Once you're on it, how do you get off?

In other words: who watches the watchers? The oldest judicial question of all, reframed with sudden urgency for a world of computers that see.","There are concerns about how police will use facial recognition technologyWe are heading, with great speed, towards an epochal moment in the history of computing.

Donald Trump's recent threats to Iran are all part of his 'muscle-flexing' politics

Donald Trump threatened the 'official end of Iran' in a recent inflammatory tweet

Donald Trump's latest moves on the international stage are all about muscle-flexing.

He is a man who views the world almost exclusively through the twin prisms of projecting strength and leveraging weakness.

Books about his time as a New York real estate tycoon remark on his instinctive ability to take advantage of opponents using these dynamics to gain the upper-hand in negotiations.

Stories from inside the White House refer to the same tactics.

One recurring story is that he prefers the people around him to operate in a perpetual state of confusion and rivalry.

He believes that in such circumstances the strongest emerges victorious, but the other benefit is that as everyone around him scrambles to work out what is going on.

Mr Trump becomes the centre of gravity, the person to who everyone turns for favour, reward, direction and orders.

He is far from the first president, or powerful person, to understand this crude version of influence.

The difference is that this leader of the free world is willing to use it to take astonishing risks in order to get what he wants.

This includes escalating the risk of armed conflict with Iran by threatening to ""end"" it via Twitter.

It also includes isolating and damaging Huawei at a time when he is attempting to come to an agreement on tariffs and trade with China, a global power.

The ""chaos merchant"" approach may be because Mr Trump is more disinhibited than we realise.

It might be a function of his inexperience.

Or it may be what happens because from his point of view its got him this far and there is little point trying to fix what isn't broken.

Whatever drives this behaviour, the outcomes are the same; a world sprinting to keep up with an unpredictable president who is playing by his own rules.

Contest to replace Theresa May as PM could expose Tories' few good options

Several Tory MPs have admitted they will bid to succeed Theresa May

As Conservative MPs survey the options for their next leader, they might be forgiven for feeling spoilt for choice.

With the race to replace Theresa May likely to begin formally within weeks, there are already well over 20 candidates seriously considering a run.

Some like Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Rory Stewart have already explicitly announced their intention, Dominic Raab has effectively done the same, while others with campaign teams already up and running continue their increasingly implausible public coquettishness - like Matt Hancock, who said today ""I don't rule out standing"".

""Wait and see"", has been the phrase used by both Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt, despite the both men using recent speeches to stray onto policy subjects way beyond their respective government briefs.

The safe assumption is that each of these figures will at the very least have a tilt in the early stages.

But when Tory MPs start the process of whittling the field down to the final two for the ballot of the party members, will this broad range of options prove to be an embarrassment of riches, or ultimately underline the fundamental absence of any good options?

There is a good chance the answer could end up being the latter.

By normal political laws of gravity, Theresa May would have been ditched by her party the morning after the 2017 general election.

Image: Prime Minister Theresa May lost the Conservatives' their majority in 2017

She had gone into that snap vote asking the British public to strengthen her hand ahead of Brexit negotiations with the EU, but in reality it was as much about ensuring she had a sufficient Commons majority domestically to avoid the kind of parliamentary paralysis we have seen play out.

She lost that majority and worsened the very problem she was attempting to alleviate, but was given a stay of execution because there was no obvious alternative leader or approach available.

:: Listen to Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Apple podcasts, Google podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

When her Brexiteer critics finally managed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership last December, it failed for that very same reason - Mrs May was by no means popular or well regarded by the majority of her party, but the fact she won the vote indicated the majority nonetheless felt there was no better option.

Despite losing three votes on her Brexit deal, very little has changed in terms of the dynamics of the background leadership race.

There may now be a clear front-runner candidate in the form of Boris Johnson, but a favourite is not the same thing as a consensus candidate.

Image: A new PM could be faced with immediate challenges about Brexit

That Mrs May is now being ousted is not because there is a suddenly an obvious replacement, but because patience in the party has finally run out.

Her failure to deliver Brexit on 29 March, and the holding of European Parliament elections have ultimately proved to be the final straw.

And yet her successor will, in all likelihood, not be embarking on a fresh start, with space and time to develop a new approach, but instead be immediately plunged into taking the deeply divisive decisions that Theresa May has desperately sought to avoid.

From day one they will face the question of whether to respond to the pressure created by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party and embrace a no-deal departure from the EU in October.

If they opt to do so, they might well need to seek a fresh majority by means of a general election this year to avoid parliamentary attempts to block it.

But doing so would likely see a number of Tory MPs quit, and a significant number of voters who may have once voted Conservative abandon the party for good.

Perhaps the hardline Brexiteers that Mr Farage has mobilised around the country could fold back in behind that kind of approach by a new prime minister to such a degree that it made up for losses of remain-inclined voters, but it would be a major electoral gamble.

And yet there is no obvious safe option.

Image: Nigel Farage set up the Brexit Party to win over voters

Could a pledge to renegotiate the backstop ever be realised in the face of the repeated refusal of Brussels to engage in such a process? Unlikely.

Can the withdrawal agreement be detoxified once Mrs May is out of the picture and still form the basis of Brexit? Unlikely.

Could any Tory leader - Brexiteer or otherwise - be politically dextrous enough to propose a confirmatory referendum as a route out of the malaise without seeing the party rupture irreconcilably? Unlikely.

These are the questions that underpin the choice Conservative MPs face when cast their eyes across the candidates.

They can expect 20 or more different answers to those questions, but far from being spoilt for choice, they could well realise there really is no good option.","Contest to replace Theresa May as PM could expose Tories' few good optionsContest to replace Theresa May as PM could expose Tories' few good optionsSeveral Tory MPs have admitted they will bid to succeed Theresa MayAs Conservative MPs survey the options for their next leader, they might be forgiven for feeling spoilt for choice.

176,'Destined to fail' - Brexit talks were doomed from the start,Jon Craig,"The PM has blamed Labour for the talks collapsing - and they have blamed her government

At the start of this week, Gavin Williamson wrote in the Mail on Sunday that the cross-party Brexit talks were destined to fail and could only end in tears.

After reports that Theresa May had tears in her eyes during her showdown with the 1922 executive, perhaps Mr Williamson's prediction has been proved correct.

After all, it has been hardly a week of shock news in politics: Boris Johnson has announced he's going to run for the Tory leadership and now the Brexit talks have collapsed.

In other news, the Pope is a Catholic and bears have been spotted in the woods.

Despite a lot of platitudes from both sides about the discussions being ""constructive and serious"", these talks were never going to end the Brexit deadlock.

The only surprise is that they were kept going for so long, more than six weeks, although there was a fairly lengthy pause during parliament's Easter recess.

Image: Gavin Williamson's prediction was soon proved correct

Now, in spite of the inevitability of the negotiations collapsing, party politics being what it is, both sides are blaming each other for the breakdown.

:: What happens now cross-party talks have failed?

Jeremy Corbyn says it's the government's fault because the turmoil in the Tory party means Theresa May's successor would almost certainly tear up any deal.

The prime minister says it's Labour's fault because Mr Corbyn's party is split on a second referendum. Both are true. But the talks have been limping towards collapse for weeks.

:: Listen to Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Apple podcasts, Google podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

This has been the week when the inevitable became reality. First, both sides made demands the other was never going to accept.

And second, the firing of the starting gun for the battle for the Tory succession was the killer blow that forced Mr Corbyn to tell the PM it wasn't worth wasting any more time.

After Mr Williamson's attempt - successful, as it has turned out - to sabotage the talks, the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer raised the stakes.

He said in a Guardian interview that there could be no deal without a government promise of a second referendum. But ministers were never going to agree to that.

Then on Monday, on the eve of this week's marathon Cabinet meeting, 13 senior Tories - including several former Cabinet ministers - turned up the heat on the PM.

Not only did the grandees - including Boris Johnson - insist on no climbdown on a customs union, the key Labour demand, but they also said any deal should not be binding on her successor.

It's that second demand that has really killed off the talks: the threat that Mr Johnson or another Brexiteer prime minister would simply rip up any deal after Labour had voted for it in the House of Commons.

As John McDonnell colourfully put it at a Wall Street Journal event this week: ""If we are going to march our troops in parliament to the top of the hill to vote for a deal, and then that's overturned within weeks, I think that would be a cataclysmic act of bad faith.""

There was a strong expectation among MPs that the Cabinet would axe the talks on Tuesday.

Image: More chance of a hole in one? David Lidington (left) has suggested the talks could resume

But instead, the PM met Mr Corbyn and told him she was going to gamble on bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to the Commons early next month. Good luck with that, prime minister.

David Lidington, speaking at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland, where the British Open is being played this year, has struck a more conciliatory note than the PM, urging Labour to vote for the bill and even suggesting the cross-party talks could resume.

Really? His optimism is surely that of an 18-handicap golfer who thinks he can reach the green from a deep fairway bunker with a giant tree in the way.

Perhaps the bunkered Mr Lidington should heed the advice of the DUP's Arlene Foster - who has invited Donald Trump to the Open - and says the talks were always doomed to failure.

It was Gavin Williamson, let's not forget, who brokered the deal with the DUP after the 2017 election. No wonder the former defence secretary agrees with Arlene Foster.

Benjamin Netanyahu: Is this the beginning of the end for Israeli PM?

The interim prime minister's party had to dissolve the parliament

Benjamin Netanyahu - still Israel's interim prime minister - is waking up this morning from what must seem like a terrible dream.

And oh that dream started so sweetly.

It began with an apparition of what appeared to be a delicious fifth election victory on 9 April.

But in the space of just six weeks that vision has transmogrified into a political nightmare that could have far reaching consequences, not just for his career but also for his freedom.

He now finds himself in purgatory, between heaven and hell.

His Likud party's decision to bring a motion - which was successful - to dissolve the Israeli parliament is a glaring admission that actually he failed to win the vote.

Whilst he looked on paper to be the best placed to form a coalition from the right wing bloc he couldn't bring everything together and square the circle.

No circle, no mandate.

To understand what's happened we need to go back and analyse this horrific dream.

Image: Avigdor Lieberman is the former Israeli Defence Minister

In it he was stalked by his nemesis - former ally, now foe - Avigdor Lieberman.

Mr Lieberman, the leader of a secular ultra nationalist party, would not back down over any changes to a law which would see more ultra orthodox students serving in the IDF.

But really that is just the surface.

It is about so much more.

Mr Lieberman, who once carried Mr Netanyahu's political bags, is jostling for position in the post-Netanyahu space which appears to be not far away.

Image: Benjamin Netanyahu arrives at a Likud party meeting

Mr Netanyahu - known by his supporters as King Bibi is facing serious allegations and possible trial for corruption and bribery.

He denies the charges but his failure to create a government now leaves him probably not enough time to pass immunity legislation which would shield him from prosecution - and that is even if he wins the election on 17 September which to be fair most polls suggest he will.

The ramifications are huge but essentially Israel could see a serving prime minister being put on trial.

Netanyahu set for fifth term

This could then be the beginning of the end for the man who has ruled Israel like an immovable colossus for more than 10 years.

There are other consequences circling, not least all for US President Donald Trump's so called Deal of the Century.

State department sources have said that the economic workshop scheduled to take place in Bahrain at the end of next month will still go ahead, but nobody will bet against it once again being kicked into the long and not so lush grass.","Benjamin Netanyahu: Is this the beginning of the end for Israeli PM?

Farage and Cable: What the Brexit Party and Lib Dem leaders have in common

Both Cable and Farage look to benefit from the Brexit impasse in ways neither anticipated

A peculiarity of the current political malaise is that Nigel Farage and Sir Vince Cable have quite a lot in common.

Primarily, both now look set to become the beneficiaries of the Brexit impasse in ways that neither truly anticipated until just a few months ago.

The reason behind the change in fortunes is the same for both - the government's failure to deliver Brexit on the 29 March.

It was the twist in the story that changed everything and provided the touchstone for Mr Farage's ""betrayal"" narrative, fuelling his new party's lead in the polls ahead of the upcoming European Parliament elections.

Image: Nigel Farage founded his Brexit Party in January

But on the other end of the spectrum, that very same government failure has become the source of fresh belief that remaining in the EU might still be possible - a belief for which the Liberal Democrats have become the principal standard bearers, despite all of Change UK's aspirations.

The apparent allure of these respective messages stems from the same thing - they are both offering simplicity and clarity in a debate that seems to be getting more polarised the more complicated the process becomes.

While Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn continue to attempt the near-impossible task of straddling both sides of their divided parties, Mr Farage and Sir Vince are organised and making hay at both ends of the national debate.

Image: Mrs May and Mr Corbyn are blaming each other for the collapse of Brexit talks

All the indications are that the results of the European elections could well see them both claim spoils that can be plausibly portrayed as debate-changing victories.

But the reality of the UK's first-past-the-post general election system means that the impact of any such victories will likely be indirect.

While nothing is impossible, a fundamental realignment that sees both Labour and Conservatives implode at a general election to such a degree that either the Brexit Party or Lib Dems could form a government remains highly unlikely.

Image: Both Cable and Farage look set to become the beneficiaries of the Brexit impasse

With Theresa May on the way out within weeks, what is almost certain is that Mr Farage's true impact will be to scupper the chances of a moderate Conservative successor.

If a new Brexiteer Tory prime minister were to take control in September, vowing a no-deal exit from the EU and seeking a general election on that basis, would those currently backing Mr Farage risk splitting the national eurosceptic vote and potentially see Brexit lost entirely?

Meanwhile, if the Liberal Democrats beat Labour to second place in the European elections, the pressure on Mr Corbyn to change tack more enthusiastically towards a second referendum will only increase.

If the Labour leader were to ignore that, he would in effect be risking an almighty revolt within his membership base, and even his shadow cabinet, all for the sake of offering up a form of Brexit that most Brexiteers have already dismissed as being in name only.

Image: Theresa May's days in Number 10 seem to be numbered

So in both cases, it seems what Sir Vince and Mr Farage have in common is the potential to influence the two major parties more decisively from the outside that the respective leaders have been able to do from the inside.

It's not perhaps the kind of power that an ambitious politician sets out for, but I suspect both men will take it.","Farage and Cable: What the Brexit Party and Lib Dem leaders have in commonFarage and Cable: What the Brexit Party and Lib Dem leaders have in commonBoth Cable and Farage look to benefit from the Brexit impasse in ways neither anticipatedA peculiarity of the current political malaise is that Nigel Farage and Sir Vince Cable have quite a lot in common.

US public 'kept in the dark' over possible war with Iran

Donald Trump says he hopes there will not be a war with Iran

The UK is scrambling to show its support for America's position on Iran.

The focus in Washington, however, is on a growing uncertainty. When asked whether the US was going to war with Iran, President Donald Trump offered an ambiguous ""I hope not"".

Assertions of an increased threat from Iran are being led by Mr Trump's hawkish national security adviser John Bolton. In the past few days it looked like US allies were resisting those claims. But now Britain is backing the US.

Republican senator Lindsay Graham told me it's good to have the support of an ally, but the real issue here is a lack of clarity from the White House.

""I'm not going to comment on something I don't know about and I would tell the administration you should pick up the phone and call members of Congress,"" he said, ""so that we don't have a microphone put in our face, ask us about why you're doing something when we have no clue.""

That sentiment is echoing across Capitol Hill from Republicans and Democrats.

Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said: ""The American people have been kept in the dark. It is disgraceful and despicable that we're on the verge of war and the American people are given this kind of confused and chaotic picture of what the situation is on the ground.""

He added: ""We are supposedly going to have a briefing on Tuesday. We're hearing it may be too late because hostilities may have begun or there may be an escalation of the military situation. That is absolutely petrifying.

""It should be frightening for the American people because it's armed men and women whose lives can be at risk.""

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Even in Mr Trump's go it alone era, allies still matter. In the heady hand-holding days of Theresa May's visit to the White House, hopes were high that the relationship could stay special.

But on Brexit, climate change, Russia and immigration to name a few, Mr Trump and Mrs May are hardly kindred spirits.

Huawei is the next big challenge. During US secretary of state Mike Pompeo's recent trip to London, he warned of an intelligence sharing breakdown if the UK allows the Chinese telecoms giant into its 5G network.

Mr Trump's executive order has escalated his campaign against the company - putting pressure on allies to follow suit.

Air Force Brigadier General Rob Spalding left the National Security Council in January, and said Huawei could put US-Russia relations under threat.

""If we felt it was a national security risk for ourselves, then over time, maybe there's going to be less of an inclination to want to share information,"" he said.

Amid the pomp and flattery of the upcoming UK state visit, no one should forget that Mr Trump is a president who will always act in his own interests.

But on Iran, it's not yet clear what they are.","US public 'kept in the dark' over possible war with IranUS public 'kept in the dark' over possible war with IranDonald Trump says he hopes there will not be a war with IranThe UK is scrambling to show its support for America's position on Iran.

Huawei finds itself in the crossfire of US-China trade war

Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump have failed to reach a deal in trade talks

Huawei has achieved quite the feat: in the space of a year, it's gone from a little known company in the US to a ""national emergency"".

US President Donald Trump didn't name the Chinese telecoms business in his executive order.

At this stage, he doesn't have to: Huawei's notoriety in the current administration means we all know who he's talking about.

The order effectively bans Huawei from the US market. That's less of a big deal than you might suppose.

First off, Huawei has already been banned from federal networks. And it doesn't have much of a presence stateside.

Advertisement

Its huge revenues - $107bn (£83bn) in 2018 - overwhelmingly come from China and the rest of the world.

However, another statement is more worrying for the company.

US has 'called it wrong' on ban says Huawei

The US Commerce Department added Huawei to its ""entity"" list. This means that American companies cannot sell technology to Huawei without a special licence.

For all its undoubted and home grown prowess in 5G networks, Huawei still relies on American technology, from chips to software.

The US applied a similar order to ZTE, another Chinese telecoms business and it was a hammer blow.

Chinese President Xi Jinping asked Mr Trump to remove the order as part of trade negotiations. Mr Trump said he did so as a favour to Mr Xi, keeping the company alive.

Huawei 'to go extra mile' to reassure world on 5G spying

Huawei is better placed than its compatriot company but will still be put under pressure.

That sort of favour is unlikely this time.

Relations between the US and China have deteriorated since then as both sides have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.

Mr Trump is still a fan of ""King"" Xi as he likes to call him - even more so, perhaps, after he said that Mr Xi wrote him a very nice letter last week.

But no deal has been reached between the two sides and we're closer to a full-blown trade war than we've ever been.

Up against the might of the US state, it's almost tempting to feel sorry for Huawei.

This is after all a private company being targeted by a government. And the company has fought a vigorous and successful rear guard action: it persuaded the UK that it could be trusted on at least some 5G networks, in defiance of the US's networks.

And you could argue that Huawei finds itself in the crossfire of a new age of strategic competition between the US and China.

But Huawei is undoubtedly close to the Chinese state.

For years, that was a benefit, acting as a business with tacit government support.



The downside is that Huawei's future now does not depend on business or economic decisions, but geopolitical ones.","Huawei finds itself in the crossfire of US-China trade warHuawei finds itself in the crossfire of US-China trade warChinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump have failed to reach a deal in trade talksHuawei has achieved quite the feat: in the space of a year, it's gone from a little known company in the US to a ""national emergency"".

186,Lords won't get the answers they want to high-speed questions,Adam Parsons,"There is plenty of anger within the pages of this report from the House of Lords, but crucially it stops short of asking for HS2 to be scrapped.

Yes, they want it amended. Yes, too, they think fundamental changes should be made and lessons learnt, even if those demands may well fall flat. But cancelled? No.

And they must know that their remaining demands are likely to go unanswered, for the simple reason that, four years ago, the same committee produced a pretty similar report with some very familiar suggestions - slower trains, reappraisal, changes to the route.

And they were almost totally ignored by the government. It's hard to imagine we're in for a change of heart, now.

Within the rail and construction industries, the feeling is that the argument has concluded about whether HS2 should be built at all.

Already, billions have been spent on the project - buying land, preparing it for construction, designing and commissioning. The idea that HS2 exists only as a paper project is wrong.

Image: Work is well underway at the Euston terminus

Visit Euston station, in the middle of London, and you'll see what I mean. Buildings have been demolished and, behind a discretely disguised door, I was welcomed on to the vast construction site where the start of HS2 is being laid out.

At the moment, it is a huge hole in the ground, buzzing with archaeologists who examine the artefacts that are being unearthed here, working alongside the diggers that are preparing the site, shielded from both sight and weather by a huge canopy that covers more than a hectare.

These artefacts are, invariably, bodies, for the site was a burial ground for 80 years from the late 18th century. Captain Matthew Flinders, the man who led the first circumnavigation of Australia, was buried here. His grave was found in January.

For the moment, the archaeologists are in charge, and nothing happens without their say-so. But their work is coming to an end. The site will shortly be cleared of the remaining coffins and bodies, and the focus will switch to building a railway.

Image: For now the archaeologists are in charge

Which is why, when you stand overlooking this activity, it's hard to imagine the Lords' report leading to a change of heart. The peers suggest that, rather than stretch to Euston, the HS2 project could instead terminate at Old Oak Common, a vast new station being built in west London.

They suggest, too, that the costs could be reduced if the top speed of trains was scaled back. Publicly, HS2 have said the report is useful; privately, it is seen as being ill-considered.

Industry insiders say Old Oak Common is not being designed as a terminus, and wouldn't be suitable. They also query why a state-of-the-art link between London and Birmingham would be doing its job if it didn't end up in the middle of the capital city.

As for the speed of the trains? ""Future-proof"" was the answer I got from one person involved in the project. ""We aren't just building this for today's trains, but for the ones to come.""

Image: Many think HS2 is a waste of money

But what of that complaint, that HS2 has been built the wrong-way round, that new rail infrastructure in the North is the priority, and that London is already very well served by rail links.

Well, the last point is true. London is the hub of Britain's rail network, with nine of our ten busiest stations. But that's been the case for a long time - certainly throughout the laborious process that saw HS2 win parliamentary approval.

It's rather hard to see how things have changed since HS2 got through both Commons and Lords. And the infrastructure plans to support the Northern Powerhouse project have been designed in parallel with the second phase of HS2. Frankly, it's unlikely that they're going to be ripped up now.

The likelihood is that HS2 will be built pretty much as it's planned now. The budget is hard to predict - not least because the lesson of Crossrail highlights the dangers of over-promising early in a project - but it's easier to foresee that controversy will continue to follow HS2.

Image: Crossrail is over schedule and over budget

It will wreck great swathes of countryside, and it will cost a fortune. And if you don't buy into the value of high-speed rail (as some don't), it may look like a gigantic waste of money.

Plus, it's hard to imagine that at least some of the contenders to become the next Conservative leader won't threaten to cancel the whole thing, just as they might oppose Heathrow's third runway.

It's right to re-think, re-appraise and check projects are going the right way. We are becoming a more environmentally-literate nation. But will the Lords report put HS2 in peril? It's hard to imagine.","Image: For now the archaeologists are in chargeWhich is why, when you stand overlooking this activity, it's hard to imagine the Lords' report leading to a change of heart.

But what of that complaint, that HS2 has been built the wrong-way round, that new rail infrastructure in the North is the priority, and that London is already very well served by rail links.

Well, the last point is true. London is the hub of Britain's rail network, with nine of our ten busiest stations. But that's been the case for a long time - certainly throughout the laborious process that saw HS2 win parliamentary approval.

It's rather hard to see how things have changed since HS2 got through both Commons and Lords. And the infrastructure plans to support the Northern Powerhouse project have been designed in parallel with the second phase of HS2. Frankly, it's unlikely that they're going to be ripped up now.

The likelihood is that HS2 will be built pretty much as it's planned now. The budget is hard to predict - not least because the lesson of Crossrail highlights the dangers of over-promising early in a project - but it's easier to foresee that controversy will continue to follow HS2.

Image: Crossrail is over schedule and over budget

It will wreck great swathes of countryside, and it will cost a fortune. And if you don't buy into the value of high-speed rail (as some don't), it may look like a gigantic waste of money.

Plus, it's hard to imagine that at least some of the contenders to become the next Conservative leader won't threaten to cancel the whole thing, just as they might oppose Heathrow's third runway.

It's right to re-think, re-appraise and check projects are going the right way. We are becoming a more environmentally-literate nation. But will the Lords report put HS2 in peril?

188,Poor performance in European elections could finish off Change UK,Lewis Goodall,"New forces are vying for the public's support in the upcoming Euro elections

On Friday evening in the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, the latest troupe which seeks to break the mould of British politics took to the stage.

The Tiggers, the ChUKas, the Remain Alliance, those for Remain and for a People's Vote, all rolled into one.

They were there to announce their ""Charter for Remain"" and despite the smiles, the breezy entrances and the jokes, everyone there knew that they met under a cloud; the latest polls showed them plumbing the depths of the low single digits and the day was marked by the party's freshly written farce: their failure to nominate a candidate for the Peterborough by-election.

For a few weeks, a few precious weeks, this group had such force, such elan, such goodwill.

Yet through a mixture of misstep and mistake, most but not all of their making, it has ebbed away.

'Politics is broken, let's change it'

The party's name, the party's look, the party's message; a catalogue of errors which have cost them dearly.

But these problems are of the second order.

Of far greater importance is that they are a group of people who know not what they are, or rather what they should be and who choose to forgo that which could make them stronger.

One by one, each of the principals made important, worthy speeches.

:: Listen to the All Out Politics podcast on Apple podcasts, Google podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

They were measured, they were sensible, they were grown up. In an era where petulance and immaturity reigns, in many ways it is to be commended.

Indeed, they say, that is their unique selling point: a room of steady grown ups, in an age of silly infants.

But at heart; isn't that the issue here? This is a party with the word ""change"" in its title, predicated on the idea that Britain needs fundamental reform. But they don't sound radical.

In fact say that the actual radical thing about them is that they don't sound very radical. They're sensible and calm - which, when you come to think of it, isn't very, well - radical is it?

And that's because, ironically enough, they haven't internalised the ""change"" that they themselves have undergone.

Rees-Mogg's sister to stand for Brexit Party

Listening to Chuka Umunna, Sarah Wollaston, Chris Leslie, Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen, it was like sitting at the meeting of a ministerial roundtable meeting on public health.

They act and they talk like they're ministers in a mid-term government, not plucky insurgents seeking to get attention and break through.

They're not in big parties any more and they can no longer rely on the premium that granted them; to make it as an insurgent force, especially in a political system like Britain's, you have to be bold, you have to stand out to get attention and to draw a crowd and to excite.

And you can afford to do it because you're not the government and have no hope of so being.

You have to be a street fighter, not a champion boxer. The Lib Dems with their ""b******* to Brexit"" slogan this week showed that they understand that precious lesson.

:: Listen to Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Apple podcasts, Google podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

There is an obvious way CUK could do the same, which would answer the basic question of the necessity of their existence and get their base excited: they could call for full blown revocation of Article 50.

Strategically it is the perfect gambit: it secures column inches, it would allow them to capture the bulk of the most hardline Remain vote; it would differentiate them from their rivals and it might actually help them realise their wider objectives.

Because sometimes, in politics, you have to demand something, something you might think unobtainable, to (a) legitimise what you really want and (b) make your second best option appear more reasonable; to move the Brexit window.

Their opponents realise this well; no-deal was once unimaginable, completely unmentioned in the referendum campaign.

Today (with the unexpected assistance of an unwitting and unthinking prime minister) it is the default for many Brexiteers.

It has also made what were once hard Brexit options, a customs union alone say, appear reasonable compromise.

Had one of the Remain forces campaigned for revoke, then a People's Vote might seem more palatable. But Chuka Umunna tells me afterwards, they won't do it because it's unreasonable and that's just not them.

The other problem comes with the party's ambition, or, hubris. At one point, Heidi Allen set out all of the policies to which she's attached, she said: ""I didn't come into politics to deal with just Brexit.""

But that is the only thing on which it should be focussed.

Blair on Brexit: Main parties could be swept away

Had stopping Brexit been the sole subject on their minds they would have made a whole series of different (and better) political choices; they would have called themselves the ""Remain Party"", they would call for revocation, they would become the unalloyed home of Remainers.

Nigel Farage doesn't have to answer about policy because he knows - and we know - that for now at least, that's not the party's purpose.

It is a carnivorous pressure group, designed to gobble up Leave voters at any cost and use that leverage to achieve its aims of an even harder Brexit, to make the Conservative Party more like itself.

For now, CUK should have accepted this lot for itself, as the obverse of the Brexit Party for Labour. They didn't and are paying a price.

Nonetheless, some argue that if Change get 5% in this election, given the structural problems they face and their own missteps, that's an impressive result.

Whether given their calamities it is impressive, however, is beside the point.

If they score 5%, they may not win a single seat. Not only will that be humiliating and destroy any momentum they have left but they will have blown their best chance of breaking through in the punishing British political marketplace, which is punishing to new entrants; circumstances will not be so auspicious again, either in general political terms nor with the electoral system at play.

Someone put it to me that Change may be an ugly dog but if an ugly dog gets 5% that still says something. Perhaps. But this is the only race this dog has a chance of winning. Everything else is immaterial.

Beyond the woes of Change UK, I am struck at how utterly lop-sided the political battlefield now is.

Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are missing in action and more surprisingly still, how is it that only the Brexit Party has been able to channel the complete anger of the paralysis of the Brexit process?

In the weeks and months leading up to the European elections, it seemed as if all the momentum was with the Remain side.

Hundreds of thousands marched, millions signed, the political activity, the anger and indignation was there for all to see.

Yet no political leader has capitalised upon it, no vehicle has emerged. Where are the catchy twitter videos? The rallies? The channelling of the Remainer anger which exists so deeply?

Whilst Brexit supporters are cheered and excited across the land by Mr Farage, his foes are missing a champion.

There are structural issues at work which impede such an emergence, but I wonder if it's not something deeper.

'PM has failed and should step aside'

Looking at the assembled forces of Remain right now, at how they communicate, I am reminded much of the Hillary Clinton campaign (and that is a little unkind to Hillary Clinton).

She (perhaps understandably) looked at her opponent and believed his manifold flaws were so self-evident that she couldn't possibly lose.

The attitude of many Remainers is the same; they look at Brexit, at no-deal, at Mr Farage and think their inadequacies, their horrors even, are so grave that they cannot come to pass.

That the arguments barely need to be made and fought for, that no vehicle is required, no hard graft needed: that truth will out.

Stephen Colbert once wryly observed ""It is a well known fact that reality has liberal bias"".

But many American voters, especially in rustbelt states, disagreed in 2016 and many British voters, despite three years of cataclysm, don't accept the realities that many Remainers and politicians think axiomatic with truth and reason.

The non-populists seem to have forgotten how to convince people who aren't like them.

Perhaps it's just that the liberal order and all the things which go with it; pluralism, cosmopolitanism, internationalism have been de jure for so long, so entrenched in the British body politic, that its adherents don't really know how to defend them.

Meanwhile, Mr Farage, under no such illusion, is beavering away, at rally after ally, building his base and getting out his vote and slowly subverting politics in his direction, to the populist right.

Who then, in short, can defend liberal England against him? I say England deliberately, given Scots and the Welsh have their own options.

Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party

Mr Corbyn, much to his surprise and that of others, appeared to do so in 2017, summoning a new political lexicon and articulation of the frustrations and anger of a generation; but the antisemitism saga and the Brexit process have dulled his sheen.

He is now barely present, the ghost at the feast, scared of moving in the direction of any of his voters, lest he lose the others.

He chooses then, not to move at all. Brexit has made him part of the process, a manager, a technician, the consummate outsider now buried deep inside the castle's walls.

The Greens have had impressive results of late but are still too small to do much.

Besides them, the obvious saviour of liberalism is, well the Liberals themselves. After all, the Lib Dems bird is finally showing signs of flight - the Remain vote is slowly consolidating behind them.

But it may be too little, too late. They're still tarnished from coalition and whether their resurgence lasts beyond the Euros remains to be seen.

Sir Vince Cable, though admirable in many ways, is unlikely to be the voice of a new generation.

Much then will depend on who they choose as leader next and whether they can find a new, fresh voice to challenge what could be a new populist politics, propelled not only by Mr Farage but a new Conservative Party chosen in his image.

The Birmingham Repertory theatre has seen some melodramas over the years, but I fear none of the stories yet told on its stage might have been as tragic as that of Change UK, not least because many would say they were so needed.

It appears unlikely they'll have a second act; the question is, who, if anyone will take their place? Will someone emerge to counter Mr Farage? Who will speak for Liberal England?

I just don't know.

If big forces in politics, like Newtonian physics, always generate counter reaction, then something, sooner or later will turn up.

How much of the old liberal order will survive by then, is less certain.","'Politics is broken, let's change it'The party's name, the party's look, the party's message; a catalogue of errors which have cost them dearly.

Concern grows over US 'grouping all Iranian activity in one bracket'

US secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in the resort town of Sochi fresh from talks in Brussels where he'd been hoping to convince EU counterparts of the risks, as the US sees them, of Iran's destabilising activity in the Middle East.

Specific details and additional intelligence beyond what the US has made publicly available is surely welcome.

Neither EU foreign ministers nor Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, are wide-eyed about Iranian activity or that of its proxies in the Middle East.

But they are also believers in the JCPOA - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran Deal - which the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from a year ago.

All accept the word of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that to date, Iran has complied faithfully with its side of the bargain on the issue of denuclearisation.

All are concerned that the US groups all Iranian activity into one bracket.

All are concerned at recent steps by the US to isolate and pressure Iran, including most recently the decision to deploy an aircraft carrier and bomber task force into the Gulf and the possible deployment of 120,000 US troops in the case of any Iranian attack on US interests, according to reports in The New York Times.

'Iranian forces ready for any eventuality'

Mr Pompeo refused to be drawn on the reported troop deployment, saying that was a matter for the US Department of Defence.

He said the US did not want war with Iran, simply that the Trump administration wanted Iran to behave like a normal country - to desist from assassination campaigns on European soil, to stop their support for Hezbollah and for the Houthis in Yemen.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Russia has Iran's ear. It is Tehran's partner in Syria and in the Astana peace process, which tries to secure a resolution to the Syrian conflict.

Sergei Lavrov said Russia would do its part in trying to ensure the situation did not tip into military conflict.

""A task for diplomats,"" Mr Lavrov said, ""and I think the US side is committed to finding a political solution.""

But just as there is very little trust between the US and Russia, there is also very little faith in Europe that the Trump administration has the will or the wherewithal to keep a potentially escalatory situation in the Middle East vis-a-vis Iran in check.

Mr Pompeo may cut a (slightly) more accommodating figure in his talks with Russian counterparts than US National Security Advisor John Bolton, who last visited Moscow in October last year to announce the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

Mr Bolton has long championed the notion of regime change in Iran and it would seem as though for now, the hawks are calling the shots in the Trump administration.

The US-Russian trajectory may be enjoying a post-Mueller bump but that is as US-Iranian relations take a major downward turn.

Why the UK steel industry is facing another fight for survival

Oh no. Here we go again. Clouds are once more hanging over the UK's steelmaking industry.

First came news last week that Indian-owned Tata Steel, the country's biggest steelmaker, must abandon plans to pool its European steel operations with those of German giant Thyssenkrupp after the European Commission indicated it would block the deal.

The combination would have created Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal and would have ensured a degree of stability for Tata's UK employees, including 4,000 or so working at the site at Port Talbot, in south Wales.

Instead, there is now more uncertainty, particularly in view of Tata's admission that the operation is still consuming cash rather than generating it.

Now comes news that the UK's second-biggest operator, is seeking a £75m loan to stave off collapse.

:: British Steel begs for taxpayer funds to avert collapse

The business, rechristened British Steel after the investment firm Greybull bought a package of assets for £1 from Tata Steel in September 2016, may even go into administration.

So are the two situations connected? Well, yes and no.

British Steel does have some problems unique to it, chiefly a rash bet it made on the EU's emissions trading scheme, under which it sold a number of the allowances with which it is required to match each tonne of CO2 its operations emit.

British Steel had more allowances than it needed for the expected CO2 emissions produced by its UK operations.

But it was caught out when the EU - which issues the permits - put a temporary suspension on new allowances being issued to UK companies until the Brexit withdrawal agreement was completed.

This, along with an unexpected surge in the price of the allowances to their highest level in a decade, has surprised the company. The Financial Times reported last month that the allowances sold by British Steel would now be worth £138m.

Faced with a shortfall in the number of allowances it needed, exposing it to a potential fine from the European Commission, British Steel turned to the government for help.

Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, gave the group a £100m loan, telling the House of Commons that the company was facing a fine of £500m as well as an estimated bill of £120m for buying the carbon permits it needed.

The latest request for funding apparently reflects a slump in orders.

The group's latest plight will raise questions about the underlying strength of the business.

The operations now called British Steel were on the verge of being closed by Tata Steel until Greybull stepped in to buy them.

Yet, under its new owner, British Steel has not found life straightforward. In its first year under the new owners, it reported earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of £47m, up from a loss of £79m on the same measure a year earlier.

However, it later emerged that Greybull had lent the business £154m, charging a rate of interest of 9.6%. That was quite a burden for the business to carry.

Just before Christmas 2017, meanwhile, British Steel slipped out news that Peter Bernscher, its chief executive, had quit after differences of opinion with the owners.

That was one of a number of difficulties Greybull suffered. Another was production delays, caused by machinery failures, in the summer of 2017 that are estimated to have cost the business tens of millions of pounds in lost sales.

Last summer saw British Steel announcing what it said was its biggest single investment for a decade, a £50m injection into the production of wire rod at Scunthorpe, but this was accompanied by news of a fall in earnings to £21m.

Image: British Steel has faced a string of challenges including sterling weakness

Shortly after that, in September last year, British Steel announced it was cutting 400 jobs - effectively one in 10 roles across the business - in a bid to save costs. One of the factors it cited was the fall in the pound which, because a lot of the raw materials the company uses are priced in dollars, had pushed up costs.

This is where the issues common to both Tata Steel and British Steel come in.

The persistent weakness in sterling is a key factor.

Another is a rise in iron ore prices globally, due to a shortage following the collapse in January of a dam operated by Vale, the Brazilian miner. Iron ore prices are currently trading at close to $100 a tonne, the highest they have been for four years, with the shortfall from Vale's operations not expected to be made good by other miners in the short term.

Higher energy costs - British steel producers, due mainly to environmental charges, pay substantially more for their electricity than their counterparts in Germany or France - and the higher price of carbon permits are also adding to the burden.

Overlaying all these factors is that there remains vast overcapacity in the global steel industry.

According to the World Steel Association, world steel production during the first three months of the year was 444.1 million tonnes, up 4.5% on the same period in 2018. Yet global steel demand is not growing nearly so rapidly.

The World Steel Association estimates that, while global demand for steel rose by 1.8% last year, it will grow by just 0.3% this year and by 0.7% next year, reflecting slower global growth and lower demand from specific industries, such as shipbuilders and car makers in South Korea.

So clearly supply is outstripping demand which, all things being equal, should bear down on prices.

Much of that excess production is coming from China which, in March alone, produced 80.3 million tonnes of steel - up 10% on the same month last year.

For the three months as a whole, Chinese production was 231 million tonnes, a record. This presents a problem for the rest of the world and is one reason why both the US and the EU have in recent years introduced measures aimed at preventing China from 'dumping' cheap steel in their markets.

Image: Steel production capacity has grown at facilities like this one in Chongqing

The EU and US have also imposed tariffs on steel imports from each other. China, for its part, argues that 85% of the steel it produces is for domestic consumption only.

Worse still, production capacity continues to increase. Part of this reflects investment by producers in better quality products - like the wire rod investment by British Steel at Scunthorpe - in the hope of better profit margins.

It also reflects producers in locations like the EU seeking to raise production levels by putting in new equipment or production processes and also investment by producers in China and Russia to raise the quality of their products.

All of these activities add to global steel production without doing anything to lift steel consumption - while a final factor is that some emerging markets, notably in Africa, are also putting on capacity of their own that did not previously exist.

And things could get even worse for British producers. UK Steel, the trade body, estimates that a 'no deal' Brexit would result in quotas or duties in markets accounting for 97% of UK steel exports - up from 15% at present - which, with nearly half of all steel in this country being exported, would bite.

It is hard to see how, ultimately, steelmaking in this country can survive such headwinds in the long run.","Why the UK steel industry is facing another fight for survivalWhy the UK steel industry is facing another fight for survivalOh no.

NSO Group: Why we should be worried about the suspected WhatsApp hackers

The NSO Group is alleged to be behind the WhatsApp attack

For most people, most of the time, hacks are like natural disasters. They arise, seemingly out of nowhere, then die down, leaving devastation in their wake.

Stories about the damage may dribble out later, but most of the details remain a mystery. Very often, we don't know who performed the hack.

We're unlikely to find out what they did with the data they stole. We may know a name of the company or institution that was targeted, but the identities of the victims are lost to posterity.

This latest surveillance attack is different.

We know for the most part how it was achieved: using a major security vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp.

We know who was targeted: human rights lawyers and campaigners, including staff at Amnesty International.

Most unusually, we also know - or believe we know - the identity of the culprit.

This attack has been linked to secretive Israeli firm NSO Group, best known for developing Pegasus - spyware that can read phone messages, track calls and videos, trace the location of a phone and even collect passwords.

:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

In the cybersecurity community, the news caused shock, but little surprise.

""It's not surprising that NSO came up with it,"" one source told me. ""They are quite quick to give demos on these things to potential customers.

""They don't reveal specifics, but they walk you into a room and show you the real time exploitation of an iPhone.""

A hack on one of the most popular messaging channels in the world is worrying enough. Yet what makes this attack especially concerning is the identity of NSO's customers and their reported targets.

NSO Group sells its software to governments around the world, in particular in the Middle East, a business that has given it a market valuation of around $1bn (£770m). This single bug alone will have meant millions of pounds in revenue.

The firm claims its software has been used to defeat terrorists and drug cartels.

But if these reports are correct, then that same software - which doesn't need its victim to click on a link or open a document, but can be directed precisely by the attacker at the time and place of their choosing - is being used to target human rights campaigners.

This isn't the first time these accusations have been aired. Friends of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi allege that his phone was infiltrated by Pegasus before he was killed by Saudi government hitmen.

The revelations raise troubling questions about the international trade in spyware, which until recently was believed to be restricted to agencies such as GCHQ.

Now, it seems, this weaponised software is for sale to anyone at a price - and not even the engineers of the world's biggest tech firms can keep it at bay.","NSO Group: Why we should be worried about the suspected WhatsApp hackersNSO Group: Why we should be worried about the suspected WhatsApp hackersThe NSO Group is alleged to be behind the WhatsApp attackFor most people, most of the time, hacks are like natural disasters.

A group of runners on a mission to beat plastic pollution have spent the past six days running along London's River Thames and picking up litter.

The group collected more than 2,500 pieces of litter and ran 189 miles (304km) - almost the equivalent of an ultra marathon.

Michelle Parkes, 39, a marketing consultant from Kingston, southwest London, and Dermot Kavanagh, 30, a personal trainer from Putney, run community action team Plogolution, a ""plogging"" group (running while picking up rubbish), in their spare time.

During the six-day stretch, six people walked and ran the route and were joined by others for smaller sections of the path, including eight extra volunteers on the final day.

They were shadowed by a support van which was needed to hold the volumes of rubbish collected along the way.

The team averaged around 30 miles (48km) and 12 hours a day, apart from on Tuesday when the group racked up 42 miles (68km) working almost 14 hours.

On their first day the group made it from the source of the Thames to Radcot and ended the sixth day running from Putney to the Thames Barrier.

The team picked up:

:: 1,107 plastic bottles

:: 489 glass bottles

:: 931 cans

:: 44 huge bags of landfill waste

""None of these people taking part have ever run that far or would consider themselves ultra runners, we are all just incredibly passionate about raising awareness and protecting the environment.""

198,Climate change linked to thousands of puffin deaths,Rachael Kennedy,"The tufted puffins are believed to have starved to death and had molted their feathers

Climate change could be the reason why thousands of tufted puffins have starved to death in the Bering Sea, according to a new study.

Timothy Jones at the University of Washington in Seattle and his colleagues monitored an area off Alaska for several months between 2016-17.

They found an unusual number of birds washing up on beaches on St Paul's Island, the majority of which were tufted puffins.

Tufted puffins are well-recognised black and white birds with orange beaks, and are a common sight along the Alaskan coastlines.

Image: Tufted puffins are a common seabird spotted along the Alaskan coastline

Researchers say they recovered around 350 bird carcasses during the study, leading to estimates that up to 8,800 had died during the period.

They were found ""severely emaciated"", with the majority of dead seabirds showing signs of recently moulting their feathers - possibly due to stress.

The report noted that periods of warmer sea temperatures had likely disturbed the food chain as lower numbers of zooplankton could be found in the area.

Zooplankton are eaten by fish, which are in turn consumed by the puffins.

A disruption to the zooplankton population could therefore begin to snowball as predator fish either die or migrate to other areas of the sea, which leads to further devastating effects down the chain.

In its concluding remarks, the report, published in the journal Plos One, said continued periods of effects from climate change could be ""particularly detrimental"" to seabirds.

It added: ""Whether seabirds are resilient to these changes will ultimately govern their long-term viability in an increasingly variable climate"".

Alaska has in particular been affected after reporting its warmest March on record earlier this year.

The Arctic state is also said by scientists to be one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.","The tufted puffins are believed to have starved to death and had molted their feathersClimate change could be the reason why thousands of tufted puffins have starved to death in the Bering Sea, according to a new study.

199,Climate change linked to thousands of puffin deaths,News Reporter,"The tufted puffins are believed to have starved to death and had molted their feathers

Climate change could be the reason why thousands of tufted puffins have starved to death in the Bering Sea, according to a new study.

Timothy Jones at the University of Washington in Seattle and his colleagues monitored an area off Alaska for several months between 2016-17.

They found an unusual number of birds washing up on beaches on St Paul's Island, the majority of which were tufted puffins.

Tufted puffins are well-recognised black and white birds with orange beaks, and are a common sight along the Alaskan coastlines.

Researchers say they recovered around 350 bird carcasses during the study, leading to estimates that up to 8,800 had died during the period.

They were found ""severely emaciated"", with the majority of dead seabirds showing signs of recently moulting their feathers - possibly due to stress.

The report noted that periods of warmer sea temperatures had likely disturbed the food chain as lower numbers of zooplankton could be found in the area.

Zooplankton are eaten by fish, which are in turn consumed by the puffins.

A disruption to the zooplankton population could therefore begin to snowball as predator fish either die or migrate to other areas of the sea, which leads to further devastating effects down the chain.

In its concluding remarks, the report, published in the journal Plos One, said continued periods of effects from climate change could be ""particularly detrimental"" to seabirds.

It added: ""Whether seabirds are resilient to these changes will ultimately govern their long-term viability in an increasingly variable climate"".

Alaska has in particular been affected after reporting its warmest March on record earlier this year.

The Arctic state is also said by scientists to be one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.","The tufted puffins are believed to have starved to death and had molted their feathersClimate change could be the reason why thousands of tufted puffins have starved to death in the Bering Sea, according to a new study.

Why do we need to explore the deep ocean?

Humankind is poised to make its next giant leap: into the deep ocean.

Nekton mission director and submersible pilot Oliver Steeds why it is so important for explorers to delve into the unknown and discover the secrets of the seas.

The deep ocean - beneath 200m (656ft) - is the beating heart of our planet and its largest and most vital ecosystem, yet we don't fully understand how it functions or how healthy it is.

We have better maps of the surface of Mars than we do of our own seabed. Less than 5% of the ocean is comprehensively monitored, and at least a staggering 95% remains unexplored.

We do know that human activity has disrupted the deep ocean and is damaging its ability to support life.

The resulting changes directly impact us all on many levels, affecting our climate, our food security, our livelihoods, our homes, our natural resources, and even the very air we breathe. We still have an opportunity to change course before we cross multiple points of no return.

Throughout human history, exploration has driven progress. The majority of our planet still remains unknown. Whenever we have travelled beyond the horizon, what we discover there has changed what we know and how we choose to live.

Millions of species are yet to be discovered. New cures for diseases are to be found. The ocean's potential for sustainable development can be unlocked. The power of ocean data can be realised. The origins of life itself are within our grasp.

When we journey into the unknown, we move forward.

The deep ocean is the final frontier. It's the largest wilderness on our planet and a place we have only just begun to explore. The deeper we go, the more astonishing the life-forms we find

Image: Millions of species are yet to be discovered

The Bathyal Zone is home to the greatest biodiversity of ocean species. It encompasses the area of the ocean between 200m (656ft) to 3,000m (1.86 miles) deep.

The greatest biomass is found in the shallows where plentiful food at shallow depths allows competitive species to assert dominance.

As we enter the Bathyal Zone, reduced access to food lowers the potential for competitive exclusion, allowing for greater numbers of species to coexist.

It is home to the greatest diversity of marine species found anywhere in the ocean, an estimated 300,000 to 10 million unique species. As we go deeper, beneath 3,000m (1.86 miles), food scarcity lowers population numbers and hinders diversity, with the exception of thermal vents, which teem with life.

Image: Reduced access to food in the Bathyal Zone lowers the potential for competitive exclusion among species

Down in the Bathyal Zone we find complex ecosystems from cold-water coral reefs to sponge beds and seamounts along with unique communities of life including deep-sea squid, whales, and sharks. The vast majority of the Bathyal Zone remains largely uncharted.

This layer of the ocean provides critical indicators of change enabling scientists to measure and understand the effects of climate change, heat absorption, acidification, the ocean carbon cycle, the impacts of resource extraction, and the degree of plastic, agricultural and industrial pollution.

As the leading marine conservation scientist, Professor Callum Roberts, a Nekton Trustee, said: ""Our ocean is undergoing rapid ecological transformation by human activities.

""The scientific consensus is that we must have an enforced protected area covering at least 30% protection of the ocean by 2030 to support a resilient ocean and a resilient planet.

Image: More oceans data has been collected in the past two years than all of human history

""Having over-fished the majority of the surface waters, we are now gaining the industrial capacity to empty the Bathyal Zone before we discover what is there. We face a race for the deep.""

From 1872 to 1876, the global Challenger expedition transformed our understanding of the ocean and resulted in the birth of marine science. With the systematic exploration of the Bathyal Zone, we have the opportunity to create another step change.

:: The Age of Submersibles: New technology unlocks access to new knowledge

We now have the ability to discover more of our planet in the next 10 years than the last 100,000 of human history. We have collected more data on our oceans in the past two years than throughout all of human history.

From Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), from seabed mapping systems and a proliferation of sensors above, on the surface of, and beneath the ocean to the initial DNA sequence library of marine animals, technological developments are now unlocking extraordinary new research capabilities.

Image: Our understanding of the sea is being boosted by the falling cost of technology

As the cost of new technology falls, the volume, diversity, and frequency of ocean data is accelerating our understanding of the sea. But it is not enough. We need greater capacity to discover and manage the sustainable development potential of the ocean and drive new policies to protect its critical ecosystems.

The immersive transparent pressure hulls of cutting-edge new manned submersibles or human operated vehicles (HOVs) provide a revolutionary new perspective for scientific observation and storytelling.

Plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds to be banned in England

Plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds will be banned in England from next April

Michael Gove is taking action on plastic pollution by banning plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England from next spring.

The environment secretary has confirmed a ban on the supply of the items from April 2020 after a consultation revealed ""overwhelming"" public support for the move.

Around 4.7 billion plastic straws, 316 million plastic stirrers and 1.8 billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds are thought to be used in England each year.

Following the ban, food and drink outlets will be unable to display plastic straws or provide them to customers.

The only exceptions include those who need to use plastic straws for medical reasons or a disability will be able to buy them from registered pharmacies or request them in restaurants, pubs and bars, and the use of plastic-stemmed cotton buds for medical and scientific purposes.

Mr Gove said: ""Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution and protect our environment.

""These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life.

""So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations.""

Image: Michael Gove has confirmed a ban on the supply of the items from April 2020

The government's response to the consultation, published on Wednesday, reveals that more than 80% of respondents back a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws.

Additionally, 90% backed a ban on drinks stirrers and 89% a ban on cotton buds.

Image: Plastic bags and debris floating in the sea

It is hoped that millions of pounds could be saved annually on clean-up efforts of used plastics.

An estimated 150 million tonnes of plastic end up in the world's oceans every year, while one million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating and getting tangled in plastic waste.

The latest measures follow Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign, which encourages people to reduce their usage of single-use plastics.

Sky chief executive Jeremy Darroch said: ""Single use plastic is a disease of our own making. We're working hard to get rid of it and completely agree with Michael Gove that urgent and decisive action is needed.""

Image: A turtle tangled in plastic

Surfers Against Sewage chief executive Hugo Tagholm also welcomed the ban.

He said: ""Stopping the production and distribution of these single-use plastic menaces will prevent them from polluting beaches nationwide. It's a really positive and bold step in the right direction in the battle against plastic pollution.

""It is also helps further drive plastic-free options and alternatives for the public so they can truly make more sustainable choices in their daily lives.""

Keep Britain Tidy has announced the winners of 71 Blue Flags and 137 Seaside Awards - an increase of 18 beaches on 2018.

The awards are quality marks for beaches and mean they are clean, safe and meet high environmental and bathing water quality standards.

It comes as a survey by Keep Britain Tidy found more than half (54%) of people said nature documentaries fronted by Sir David Attenborough had encouraged them to personally clear up discarded litter.

Sky News has also been running its successful Ocean Rescue campaign to cut plastic pollution and clean up our oceans.

207,Scotland's plastic bottle scheme is game-changer for recycling,Thomas Moore,"A deposit return bank in Germany. Schemes have had dramatic effects on recycling rates

Scotland's decision to bring in a deposit on drinks bottles and cans is a game-changer for recycling.

The environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham announced in Holyrood that cans, plastic bottles and glass will be included in a deposit return scheme which could be up and running in Scotland by 2021.

It's just 20p - small change - and consumers will get it back when they return the empty.

But other countries that have introduced bottle deposit schemes (DRS) have seen recycling rates double to 90% or more.

Image: Plasticus was used to show the scale of the ocean pollution, by Sky's campaign

Sky Ocean Rescue started campaigning for a DRS in January 2017 because the evidence is so overwhelming.

Advertisement

I revealed 18 months ago astonishing research showing that 700,000 plastic bottles are littered every day in the UK. But a small deposit could reduce that to just 100,000.

It also makes sense in the context of climate change. Recycling one tonne of plastic bottles saves 1.5 tonnes of carbon.

The Scottish Government has a track record of bold initiatives. It was the first part of the UK to introduce a public smoking ban, the first to bring in a minimum price on alcohol, and now the first to bring in a deposit scheme.

England's plans for bottle deposits lag behind.

Image: A plastics return machine in Sydney, Australia

A public consultation on a scheme closes next week (13 May). Then it'll be weeks if not months before we hear the outcome.

The UK's environment secretary Michael Gove is in favour of a DRS. But there is uncertainty over what England's scheme would look like.

Retailers are lobbying for it to apply only to bottles 500ml or smaller, which tend to be bought on-the-go. They argue household recycling can sweep up the larger sizes.

But barely half of all drinks bottles consumed at home end up being recycled, so environmental groups are demanding an 'all-in' scheme. It's a far clearer message to consumers - and it's proven to work abroad.

210,Italian island of Capri bans tourists from using single-use plastics,Lucia Binding,"Capri is struggling to manage all of the rubbish left behind by tourists

Famed for its designer boutiques, film star visitors and saccharine limoncello, the Italian island of Capri is not typically associated with environmentalism.

However, the popular holiday destination is struggling to manage all of the rubbish left behind by its annual 2.3 million tourists.

As a solution, mayor Gianni De Martino has approved an order banning from the municipality all single-use plastics that are not biodegradable.

Image: The Blue Grotto remains one of the island's most popular tourist attractions

The rules came into force on 1 May and includes plastic bags, cups, utensils, water bottles, straws and even coffee stirrers.

Special attention will be given to the beaches and the coastal strip, which are most affected by pollution for the plastic waste directed to the sea.

Advertisement

Those who are caught swigging from a plastic water bottle in the heat or picnicking with plastic plates on the rugged coastline will be handed a fine of up to €500 (£428).

The order signed by Mr De Martino states: ""The use, possession, marketing and importation of disposable products in the entire municipal area, including the beaches and the entire coastline, is mandatory for food use in plastic [cutlery, plates, glasses, trays, coffee posts, containers for removing food, disposable bags] made of biodegradable and compostable material.""

In order to allow the exhaustion of stocks and warehouse deposits, the sale and use of the products covered by the order is permitted for 90 days.

Mr De Martino said in order to protect Capri's name and image in the world, it ""couldn't avoid participating in an environmental sustainability initiative"".

Image: Capri has banned all single-use plastics

One of Capri's best-known natural sites is the Blue Grotto, which is a dark cavern where the sea glows electric blue, and attracts up to 20,000 tourists per day during the summer, many of them daytrippers from the Amalfi Coast.

The majority explore the island for the day and often leave without spending much money, which is not good for the local economy.

Mr De Martino estimated that 85% of Capri's visitors fall into this category.

The island's prohibition comes after the European Parliament marked 2021 as the expiration date of single-use plastics.

Last month, the council of ministers of Italy approved a bill that will allow fishermen to collect the plastic left in their nets.

They previously had to throw it back into the sea to avoid facing a crime of illegal transport of waste, as well as having to pay for its elimination.

Theresa May formally resigns as Conservative leader to pave way for official leadership contest

Mrs May's final appearance on the world stage could be at the G20 at the end of the month

Theresa May has formally resigned as Conservative Party leader to allow the official start of the contest to replace her.

Officials from the Tories' 1922 Committee confirmed in a statement that the prime minister had quit as leader.

However, she will stay on as acting leader until her successor has been elected.

The 1922 Committee said it was now inviting nominations from Conservative MPs who wish to take over from Mrs May. They have until 5pm on Monday to formally apply.

So far, 11 candidates have publicly declared their intention to enter the contest.

Advertisement

They will face rounds of voting among MPs to choose a final pairing, with the winning candidate then chosen by a postal ballot of Conservative Party members.

It is expected the Tories' grassroots will be asked to submit their votes by 5pm on 22 July, meaning a new Conservative leader - and therefore prime minister - will be in place as early as 23 July.

Downing Street has been keen to make Mrs May's formal resignation as Tory leader a low-key event, with the prime minister likely to stay in office for many more weeks.

Sources suggested it was important that Mrs May remains PM in the public's mind.

According to reports on Friday, Mrs May is at odds with Chancellor Philip Hammond over plans for a series of spending announcements during her remaining time in office.

The Financial Times said the Treasury estimated Mrs May's proposed promises - including a boost to education funding - could cost more than £10bn and might eat into Mr Hammond's ""war chest"" for a possible no-deal Brexit.

Ahead of her last few weeks, Mrs May's spokesman said on Thursday: ""You heard the prime minister talk passionately about some of the domestic policy issues which she cares about.

""She will continue to focus on trying to deliver for the people of this country.""

Mrs May entered Downing Street in 2016 with a pledge to tackle the ""burning injustices"" in society.

But she has seen much of her time dominated by the Brexit deadlock, which eventually led her to tearfully announce her intention to resign outside Number 10 last month.

Theresa May resigns - full statement

Mrs May's last appearance on the world stage as prime minister could be the G20 summit in Japan on 28-29 June.

Those vying to replace her include five members of her cabinet; Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.

Her former ministers Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, and Sam Gyimah have also entered the race, along with David Cameron's former chief whip Mark Harper.","Theresa May formally resigns as Conservative leader to pave way for official leadership contestTheresa May formally resigns as Conservative leader to pave way for official leadership contestMrs May's final appearance on the world stage could be at the G20 at the end of the monthTheresa May has formally resigned as Conservative Party leader to allow the official start of the contest to replace her.

214,Boris Johnson wins challenge against court summons over Brexit campaign claims,Greg Heffer,"Boris Johnson will no longer have to appear in court over allegations he misled the public during the Brexit campaign.

The former foreign secretary successfully challenged a demand to appear in court after a private prosecution was brought against him by campaigner Marcus Ball.

Mr Johnson, who was the Vote Leave figurehead, was accused of misconduct in a public office over claims he made during the Brexit referendum campaign about the UK sending £350m a week to the EU.

Image: The MP claimed the UK sends the EU £350m a week during the Brexit campaign

At a High Court hearing on Friday, Mr Johnson's lawyers told senior judges he denied acting improperly or dishonestly during the 2016 campaign.

They challenged the summons for him to attend Westminster Magistrates' Court over three allegations of misconduct in public office brought by Mr Ball, who crowdfunded £300,000 through an online campaign to bring the prosecution.

Mr Johnson, who is favourite in the race to replace Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister, will now not face a criminal prosecution after the High Court overturned the summons.

Addressing Mr Johnson's barrister, Adrian Darbishire QC, Lady Justice Rafferty said: ""We are persuaded, Mr Darbishire, so you succeed, and the relief that we grant is the quashing of the summonses.""

Mr Darbishire earlier told the court that the £350m a week figure was disputed ""as soon it was said"" and remains the subject of public debate.

Mr Ball's lawyers, in written submissions, argued the attempted prosecution was ""an issue of significant public and political interest"" that had been ""heightened"" by Mr Johnson's entry into the Tory leadership election.

They said: ""The entirely proper motivation for the prosecution is to hold to account a high-profile politician and holder of public office for what is alleged to be significant misconduct in relation to an issue of great public importance.""

Referring to the £350m a week figure, Mr Ball's representatives added: ""There is ample evidence that (Mr Johnson) did know it was a false and misleading figure.""

Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the hearing, Mr Ball said he would consider his next steps after the court gives reasons for its decision.

He added: ""We have just given the green light for every politician to lie to us about our money forever. That is a terrifying idea.""

Asked if he had a message for Mr Johnson, Mr Ball said: ""You don't have the right to lie to the public about how their money is being spent.""

He added: ""I would ask you, please, all members of Parliament, all elected representatives, understand: you cannot lie to the public about their money.""

215,Boris Johnson wins challenge against court summons over Brexit campaign claims,Political Reporter,"Boris Johnson will no longer have to appear in court over allegations he misled the public during the Brexit campaign.

The former foreign secretary successfully challenged a demand to appear in court after a private prosecution was brought against him by campaigner Marcus Ball.

Mr Johnson, who was the Vote Leave figurehead, was accused of misconduct in a public office over claims he made during the Brexit referendum campaign about the UK sending £350m a week to the EU.

At a High Court hearing on Friday, Mr Johnson's lawyers told senior judges he denied acting improperly or dishonestly during the 2016 campaign.

They challenged the summons for him to attend Westminster Magistrates' Court over three allegations of misconduct in public office brought by Mr Ball, who crowdfunded £300,000 through an online campaign to bring the prosecution.

Mr Johnson, who is favourite in the race to replace Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister, will now not face a criminal prosecution after the High Court overturned the summons.

Addressing Mr Johnson's barrister, Adrian Darbishire QC, Lady Justice Rafferty said: ""We are persuaded, Mr Darbishire, so you succeed, and the relief that we grant is the quashing of the summonses.""

Mr Darbishire earlier told the court that the £350m a week figure was disputed ""as soon it was said"" and remains the subject of public debate.

Jeremy Corbyn tells Conservative leadership contenders to 'bring it on' after by-election win

Jeremy Corbyn has told the ""squabbling"" Tory leadership candidates that his Labour Party are ""ready for a general election at any time"".

Speaking in Peterborough after Labour secured a narrow by-election victory over Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, Mr Corbyn said: ""All the experts wrote Labour off - write Labour off at your peril.""

Prime Minister Theresa May will today resign as Tory leader to allow the contest to replace her to formally begin, with 11 candidates having already announced their intention to run.

And Mr Corbyn added: ""On the day that Theresa May ceases to be leader of the Conservative Party, my message is to all the squabbling contenders for the Tory party leadership: Bring it on! We are ready for a general election at any time!""

Image: Peterborough by-election result

Labour's candidate Lisa Forbes, with 10,484 votes, will become the newest MP in the House of Commons after beating the Brexit Party's candidate Mike Greene, who attracted 9,801 votes.

The Conservatives, who held the seat between 2005 and 2017, endured a disappointing night as their candidate Paul Bristow finished third with 7,243 votes.

Speaking earlier, as he left for Peterborough to congratulate Ms Forbes, Mr Corbyn said: ""The people of Peterborough rejected austerity and rejected the no-deal Brexit being offered by the Brexit Party.""

Labour's disappointing result in May's EU elections, where they finished third behind the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats, had seen Mr Corbyn face growing calls to fully support a second EU referendum in order to win over Remain voters.

Corbyn: 'We're gonna win' general election

But, with Peterborough having backed Leave at the 2016 EU referendum, the Labour leader added: ""This win shows that Labour has support all across the piece, all across the country.

""And we are ready for a general election whenever it comes and we will stop the Tories taking this country into a no-deal Brexit, with all the threats to jobs that go with that.""

Image: Jeremy Corbyn celebrates with newly-elected Peterborough MP Lisa Forbes

Ms Forbes faced controversy in the week before polling day over a Facebook post she ""liked"", which said Mrs May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"".

She apologised ""wholeheartedly for not calling out these posts"" and explained she had liked the video attached to the post and ""not the views expressed in the accompanying text"".

Mr Corbyn said: ""Our party campaigned very hard. We had unbelievable levels of hostility from much of the mainstream media throughout the campaign.

""But our doorstep message, our message in the communities, carried the day and that is what political power is all about.""

On the Tory leadership election, the Labour leader said: ""I don't know who the new leader is going to be, but it seems to be a choice between no deal, no deal and no deal, as far as I can understand it.""

Mr Farage insisted that second place in Peterborough showed their victory in the EU elections last month was ""not a flash in the pan"".

""We're here to stay, politics has fundamentally changed and, on top of what happened here last night, there was a national opinion poll that put us six points in the lead!,"" he said.

""So something is really changing out there.""

'Westminster still doesn't get it'

Giving his reasons for the Brexit Party's failure to win the seat, Mr Farage added: ""We are very new, we came into this with bags of enthusiasm but we didn't actually have the data on the ground.

""That, in the end, is what wins and loses by-elections.

""We were up against the national Labour Party machine here.

""They can't fight us like this in every seat in the country and, if the polls are right and we're now in the lead, who can even predict what would happen at a general election?""

New Labour MP 'fought on local issues not Brexit'

After Mrs May twice delayed the UK's exit from the EU, Brexit is now due to happen on 31 October.

Despite a number of Tory leadership candidates vowing to push ahead with Brexit this autumn should they become prime minister, Mr Farage said: ""I have a feeling they're going to march everybody up to the top of the hill and then back down again.

""I'm not sure any of them have really got the courage to do this.""

Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Esther McVey were among those Conservative contenders to claim the Peterborough result showed the need for the Tories to ""deliver Brexit"".

Some, although not all, the Tory candidates have promised to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October with or without a divorce agreement.

Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis admitted he was ""very disappointed"" by the outcome of the by-election.

Asked if Peterborough result would make the Tories resolved to avoid a general election, Mr Lewis told Sky News: ""In the time I've spent going around the country, which I do every week, I've not heard anybody asking me for a general election.

Nigel Farage marked Theresa May's last day as Conservative leader by visiting Downing Street to hand-deliver a fresh demand for his Brexit Party to be involved in EU negotiations.

The prime minister announced her plans to quit the day after last month's EU elections, which saw the Brexit Party top the polls and have 29 of their candidates elected to the European Parliament.

Speaking in Downing Street - alongside Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice - after delivering his letter to Mrs May, Mr Farage said: ""We've got 55 days now of total impasse while the government spends its time working out who the next prime minister is.

""We've only got five months until we're due to leave, we would love to start helping now.

Commenting on Mrs May's last day at the top of her party, before she becomes acting leader as the Tory leadership contest takes place, Mr Farage added: ""On a human level, she's had a very tough time.

""On a political level, to have a leader who was a Remainer has been a mistake.""

220,Andrea Leadsom wants to push through parts of Theresa May's Brexit deal through parliament,Beth Rigby,"The D-Day commemorations complete, Theresa May will today relinquish the role as Conservative party leader.

On Monday the race to replace her begins in earnest, as the starting gun is fired on the party's official election process and the hustings get underway.

And Andrea Leadsom, the woman who made way for Mrs May in 2016, is planning another run for the job, despite being someway down the running order.

Once the poster girl for the Brexiteer wing of the party, her decision to remain in cabinet as leader of the House throughout the whole Brexit business has dented her sheen.

Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson have replaced her as the true Brexiteer candidates, but Mrs Leadsom is undaunted and is preparing to throw her hat in the ring.

Image: Beth Rigby interviews Andrea Leadsom

The former leader of the Commons, who quit cabinet on the eve of the publication of Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill (in the end it never saw the light of day), is undoubtedly an underdog.

There have been questions whether Mrs Leadsom, who was only three years ago in the final two of the contest to become prime minister, can even drum up the support (eight backers) to enter the race. She tells me she's got the backers and she hopes she has a plan on Brexit that might just bring other Brexiteers on board.

Like other key Brexiteers - Mr Johnson and Mr Raab - Mrs Leadsom is clear about one thing: Brexit must be delivered on 31 October. The time for trying to renegotiate Mrs May's deal - rivals Mr Raab, Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid are all pushing variations of this idea - is over.

""Essentially, I believe the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead,"" says Mrs Leadsom as we sit on her white leather couch over cups of peppermint tea in her Westminster flat. ""The EU won't change it and parliament won't vote for it and we have to leave the EU at the end of October.""

Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom speaks to Sky News

Instead Mrs Leadsom has a different plan: she wants to push through key parts of Mrs May's toxic Brexit deal through parliament in order to soften the impact of leaving without a deal on October 31.

Mrs Leadsom describes the plan as a ""managed exit"". The aim is to put measures in place to avoid a ""so-called crashing out"" on 31 October. It is effectively a pick-and-mix of Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement and it requires an gigantic dose of goodwill from both parliament and the European Union to make her plan work.

The Leadsom plan is three-fold. First, introduce essential legislation on areas provisionally agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the EU to smooth the Brexit process.

Mrs Leadsom wants to introduce a citizens' rights bill to protect EU citizens in the UK - and an EU Departure Provisions Bill to include ""sensible measures"" covering areas such as sovereign bases, security measures, cross-border flights and medicine.

Second, ramp up preparations for leaving the EU at the end of October, including work on a ""virtual border"" for Northern Ireland and special arrangements for ""just in time"" supply chains.

The third measure would be to lead a delegation to speak to EU27 leaders to discuss the measures the UK is offering EU to support a managed exit. Mrs Leadsom is proposing a summit in September to agree a programme.

Image: Andrea Leadsom wants to push through key parts of Theresa May's toxic Brexit deal through parliament

But Mrs Leadsom herself admitted in our interview that ""nothing is guaranteed"" in all of this. Her plan requires the EU to want to play ball and agree, in effect, a series of ""mini-deals"" around specific arrangements to avoid a ""chaotic"" no-deal.

That is a big ask and a big unknown: the European Commission has spent two years hammering out a Withdrawal Agreement bill and now a potential future prime minister is essentially requesting to cherry pick parts of it to ensure Britain can quit and not face huge disruption.

""Of course nothing is guaranteed. All of these are political calculations but essentially if you agree with the EU that we are leaving at the end of October and that will be in their interests and our interests you then turn around that debate so that we and the EU can have a shared interest in making sure that the transition is smooth.""

And as for parliament, I put it to Mrs Leadsom that MPs will amend any piece of legislation she lays before parliament to try to block her plan to leave on 31 October without a deal.

Mrs Leadsom doesn't agree. ""I don't see it in the same light. Most of my colleagues are on the side of the House and certainly the DUP are very keen to leave the EU. And you're right they don't want to do it with a no-deal Brexit but I am talking about a managed exit and by definition that is not no-deal.""

And this is the nub of all of this. Each leadership candidate is trying to sell a Brexit plan that rests on a wing and a prayer.

Mrs Leadsom wants a managed exit, but whether she can get it depends on a benevolent EU and UK parliament. Other Brexiteers are promising to try a renegotiation with a view to quitting come what may on 31 October (Mr Raab and Mr Johnson) and then there's a group of candidates - including Mr Hancock and Michael Gove - who want to leave with a deal and will focus on negotiations rather than a hard out.

Some depend on parliament shifting, others depend on the EU. Not one candidate can confidently say they can get any plan - or a no-deal - through the Commons.

Perhaps that's why Mr Raab refused to rule out proroguing parliament this autumn in order to prevent blocking a no-deal Brexit.

Suspending a parliamentary session and shutting down the Commons to push through a no-deal is truly unprecedented.

King Charles I did it in the 17th century to get his way - and it ultimately cost him his head. Now it seems some in the Tory party are losing theirs.

Because the situation is dreadful. The numbers in the Commons are still the same. There is no alternative plan to Mrs May's. So far the candidates who would replace her are either trying to plunder the best bits of her agreement with the EU or slightly adjust the terms (Ireland's backstop the focus) in order to get a deal done.

Whether they are successful is the big unknown. Parliament is determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit while a wing of leadership contenders are adamant that Brexit must be delivered on Halloween.

Mrs May was effectively asked by her party to stand down because this was a timetable she would not sign up to. A prime minister who tried to get her deal through three times and delay Brexit twice was not a woman ready to pursue no-deal.

221,Andrea Leadsom wants to push through parts of Theresa May's Brexit deal through parliament,Political Editor,"The D-Day commemorations complete, Theresa May will today relinquish the role as Conservative party leader.

On Monday the race to replace her begins in earnest, as the starting gun is fired on the party's official election process and the hustings get underway.

And Andrea Leadsom, the woman who made way for Mrs May in 2016, is planning another run for the job, despite being someway down the running order.

Once the poster girl for the Brexiteer wing of the party, her decision to remain in cabinet as leader of the House throughout the whole Brexit business has dented her sheen.

Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson have replaced her as the true Brexiteer candidates, but Mrs Leadsom is undaunted and is preparing to throw her hat in the ring.

The former leader of the Commons, who quit cabinet on the eve of the publication of Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill (in the end it never saw the light of day), is undoubtedly an underdog.

There have been questions whether Mrs Leadsom, who was only three years ago in the final two of the contest to become prime minister, can even drum up the support (eight backers) to enter the race. She tells me she's got the backers and she hopes she has a plan on Brexit that might just bring other Brexiteers on board.

Like other key Brexiteers - Mr Johnson and Mr Raab - Mrs Leadsom is clear about one thing: Brexit must be delivered on 31 October. The time for trying to renegotiate Mrs May's deal - rivals Mr Raab, Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid are all pushing variations of this idea - is over.

""Essentially, I believe the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead,"" says Mrs Leadsom as we sit on her white leather couch over cups of peppermint tea in her Westminster flat. ""The EU won't change it and parliament won't vote for it and we have to leave the EU at the end of October.""

Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom speaks to Sky News

Instead Mrs Leadsom has a different plan: she wants to push through key parts of Mrs May's toxic Brexit deal through parliament in order to soften the impact of leaving without a deal on October 31.

Mrs Leadsom describes the plan as a ""managed exit"". The aim is to put measures in place to avoid a ""so-called crashing out"" on 31 October. It is effectively a pick-and-mix of Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement and it requires an gigantic dose of goodwill from both parliament and the European Union to make her plan work.

The Leadsom plan is three-fold. First, introduce essential legislation on areas provisionally agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the EU to smooth the Brexit process.

Mrs Leadsom wants to introduce a citizens' rights bill to protect EU citizens in the UK - and an EU Departure Provisions Bill to include ""sensible measures"" covering areas such as sovereign bases, security measures, cross-border flights and medicine.

Second, ramp up preparations for leaving the EU at the end of October, including work on a ""virtual border"" for Northern Ireland and special arrangements for ""just in time"" supply chains.

The third measure would be to lead a delegation to speak to EU27 leaders to discuss the measures the UK is offering EU to support a managed exit. Mrs Leadsom is proposing a summit in September to agree a programme.

Image: Andrea Leadsom wants to push through key parts of Theresa May's toxic Brexit deal through parliament

But Mrs Leadsom herself admitted in our interview that ""nothing is guaranteed"" in all of this. Her plan requires the EU to want to play ball and agree, in effect, a series of ""mini-deals"" around specific arrangements to avoid a ""chaotic"" no-deal.

That is a big ask and a big unknown: the European Commission has spent two years hammering out a Withdrawal Agreement bill and now a potential future prime minister is essentially requesting to cherry pick parts of it to ensure Britain can quit and not face huge disruption.

""Of course nothing is guaranteed. All of these are political calculations but essentially if you agree with the EU that we are leaving at the end of October and that will be in their interests and our interests you then turn around that debate so that we and the EU can have a shared interest in making sure that the transition is smooth.""

And as for parliament, I put it to Mrs Leadsom that MPs will amend any piece of legislation she lays before parliament to try to block her plan to leave on 31 October without a deal.

Mrs Leadsom doesn't agree. ""I don't see it in the same light. Most of my colleagues are on the side of the House and certainly the DUP are very keen to leave the EU. And you're right they don't want to do it with a no-deal Brexit but I am talking about a managed exit and by definition that is not no-deal.""

And this is the nub of all of this. Each leadership candidate is trying to sell a Brexit plan that rests on a wing and a prayer.

Mrs Leadsom wants a managed exit, but whether she can get it depends on a benevolent EU and UK parliament. Other Brexiteers are promising to try a renegotiation with a view to quitting come what may on 31 October (Mr Raab and Mr Johnson) and then there's a group of candidates - including Mr Hancock and Michael Gove - who want to leave with a deal and will focus on negotiations rather than a hard out.

Some depend on parliament shifting, others depend on the EU. Not one candidate can confidently say they can get any plan - or a no-deal - through the Commons.

Perhaps that's why Mr Raab refused to rule out proroguing parliament this autumn in order to prevent blocking a no-deal Brexit.

Suspending a parliamentary session and shutting down the Commons to push through a no-deal is truly unprecedented.

King Charles I did it in the 17th century to get his way - and it ultimately cost him his head. Now it seems some in the Tory party are losing theirs.

Because the situation is dreadful. The numbers in the Commons are still the same. There is no alternative plan to Mrs May's. So far the candidates who would replace her are either trying to plunder the best bits of her agreement with the EU or slightly adjust the terms (Ireland's backstop the focus) in order to get a deal done.

222,Leaked document reveals Tory leadership spending rules,Sam Coates,"Unspent funds by the leadership campaigns should be passed to the Conservative Party

Candidates to succeed Theresa May will not have to count any spending on their leadership campaigns made before Friday, even though teams have been up and running for weeks, according to leaked rules obtained by Sky News.

Those competing to become the next prime minister will be allowed to spend £150,000 over the course of the campaign.

However, the leaked 18-page document of guidance to assist candidates reveals that they only have to declare the spending made as of Friday.

Image: The Tory leadership contest figures

A number of leadership campaigns, including those to appoint Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, have been up and running with several members of staff for weeks.

The contest to become the next prime minister formally begins on Friday when Theresa May resigns as Conservative Party leader.

This will start a six-week contest to replace Mrs May, likely to see her hand over to a successor shortly before parliament breaks for the summer.

The 1922 Committee, which represents Tory MPs and oversees the first stage of the leadership campaign, declared on Thursday that the rules would be kept secret.

Cheryl Gillan, the acting co-chair of the 1922 committee, said they had not been disclosed in the past and there were no plans to publish them now.

However, the 18-page document sets out the fine details of the rules which will decide the next prime minister, although it does not detail what will happen to anyone who breaches them.

Image: Theresa May formally steps down on Friday

The document gives a glimpse of how the contest is likely to be run.

The rules specify that:

:: Candidates must spend less than £150,000 and report all spending over £50 and report all donations 28 days after they land in the relevant bank account;

:: The leadership contenders must declare free accommodation or office expenses, the value of any free travel provided and the full value of printed election materials;

:: Candidates who are helped by outside organisations - known as ""third parties"" - must declare this spending towards their total;

:: Candidates must declare the salary of their staff, even if their services are provided for free by another organisation;

:: Special advisers and House of Commons staff can only work for a leadership campaign outside of their working hours;

:: Candidates have no right to party data and should not ask associations for access to membership data or obtain by other means.

The document makes clear that all campaigning done before Friday, including leaflets distributed, are not caught by the spending limits.

224,Jeremy Hunt suggests UK copy Trump's tax cuts and use no-deal Brexit cash to boost economy,Greg Heffer,"Tory leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has said he would use the UK's no-deal Brexit ""war chest"" and copy Donald Trump's tax-cutting agenda to ""turbo-charge"" the economy.

The foreign secretary, who is running to replace Theresa May as prime minister, claimed Brexit would be seen as a ""success"" if the UK economy grew faster than the eurozone.

At his Spring Statement in March, Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed the Treasury has £26bn in extra spending power, which he could unleash if a no-deal departure from the EU is avoided.

But Mr Hunt, in an interview with The Spectator, revealed he would use the money immediately if he won the keys to 10 Downing Street.

He said: ""Look at the headroom that we now have in the economy, the £26bn that we know the Treasury has now, which is keeping a business war chest for a no-deal. Use it right away.

""The best thing that you can do is to fire up the economy! Turbo-charge it so that, whatever challenges we face, our businesses are really motoring.""

Mr Hunt, who has previously claimed a no-deal Brexit would be ""political suicide"" for the Tories, said he would still be prepared to see the UK leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement.

""In the end, I've always thought the democratic risk of no Brexit is more dangerous than the economic risk of no deal,"" he said.

Mr Hunt said he would also take inspiration from Mr Trump's economic agenda, having met the US president during his state visit this week.

The cabinet minister wants to cut UK corporation tax to 12.5% from the current 19%, bringing it into line with Irish levels.

He said: ""Instead of fashionably deriding Trump, we should actually look at the fact that America's GDP growth is double ours.""

Meanwhile, ex-cabinet minister and fellow Tory leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom used an article on the BrexitCentral website to set out her plan for a ""managed"" exit from the EU.

Declaring Mrs May's Brexit deal with the EU ""dead"", the former leader of the House of Commons said she would introduce a Citizens' Rights Bill to ""give peace of mind"" to UK citizens living in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.

Image: Andrea Leadsom set out her plan for a 'managed' Brexit

If she became prime minister, Ms Leadsom said she would also bring forward an EU Departure Provisions Bill to enshrine in law those agreements that have already been successfully negotiated by the UK and EU.

In addition, the Brexiteer would speed up no-deal Brexit preparations for businesses and for ""alternative arrangements"" on the Irish border, as well as proposing a summit for EU leaders to agree ""sensible measures"" with the UK for a ""smooth exit"".

The EU has previously insisted there will be no renegotiation of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement, while the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has dismissed suggestions of a ""managed"" no deal.

He has warned there would be ""no further discussions"" between the EU and the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with ""unilateral"" contingency plans to be activated in such a scenario.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled out parliament being temporarily shut down in order for a no-deal Brexit to happen on 31 October.

Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has not ruled proroguing parliament to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal exit this autumn, should he become prime minister.

But, Mr Bercow told MPs on Thursday: ""Parliament will not be evacuated from the centre stage of the decision-making process on this important matter.

How will the Conservative Party elect their new leader and the UK's next prime minister?

Candidates are vying to be the next occupant of 10 Downing St

Conservative officials have revealed the rules for their party's leadership contest, which will also decide the UK's next prime minister. Here's how it works:

:: Friday 7 June - Theresa May will officially resign as Conservative Party leader in a letter to the Tories' 1922 Committee.

She will henceforth become acting leader.

:: Monday 10 June - Leadership candidates have between 10am and 5pm to formally apply to enter the contest. Each candidate will need the backing of eight MPs in order to join the race.

This is a change from the last Tory leadership election in 2016, when candidates needed the initial backing of only two MPs.

Advertisement

The 1922 committee will announce the final list of candidates at 5.30pm.

Currently, 11 Tory MPs have made public their intention to enter the contest.

:: 11/12 June - The candidates will take part in the first hustings event organised by the 1922 Committee.

Only Conservative MPs will be able to attend.

Conservative peers will not be able to attend the event while, despite their confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, DUP MPs also won't be permitted entry.

No media will be allowed in the room either.

:: 13 June - The first ballot of Tory MPs will take place.

Each MP will cast their vote - either in person or by proxy - by posting their papers into black tin boxes in Committee Room 14 in parliament.

The votes will then be counted in another room before the 1922 Committee's co-chairmen, Dame Cheryl Gillan and Charles Walker, will announce the results.

Candidates will be required to win 5% of votes (a total of 17 MPs) to move on from the first round.

If candidates don't meet the threshold, they will be eliminated.

If all candidates (or indeed no candidates) meet the threshold, the one with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated.

If no candidates meet the threshold and there is a tie at the bottom, there will be a ""frank discussion"" with those candidates about whether or not they agree to drop out.

If they don't, this could mean the ballot is voted on again.

Theresa May resigns - full statement

:: 17 June - The candidates will take part in a second hustings event organised by the 1922 Committee.

:: 18 June - A second ballot of Tory MPs will take place with candidates this time requiring 10% of votes (33 MPs) to make it through the second round.

The same rules as the first ballot on candidates being eliminated will apply.

:: 19/20 June - A third, fourth, fifth and possibly sixth ballot of Tory MPs will be held, depending on how many rounds of voting are needed to whittle the candidates down to a final pair.

At each round, the candidate with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated.

:: 22 June - The final pair of candidates are expected to be in Birmingham to take part in the first hustings event in front of Conservative Party members.

Further hustings events are likely to be held in every region of the country.

:: 22 July - It is expected the party's grassroots members will be asked to submit their vote for their favoured candidate by 5pm on 22 July.

:: 23 July - This could see the announcement of the winning candidate by the 1922 Committee and might also be the day Theresa May visits the Queen to resign as prime minister in order to hand over to her successor.","How will the Conservative Party elect their new leader and the UK's next prime minister?

If all candidates (or indeed no candidates) meet the threshold, the one with the lowest number of votes will be eliminated.

If no candidates meet the threshold and there is a tie at the bottom, there will be a ""frank discussion"" with those candidates about whether or not they agree to drop out.

If they don't, this could mean the ballot is voted on again.

Tory leadership hopeful Esther McVey: I'll only have Brexiteers in my Cabinet

Conservative leadership contender Esther McVey has said she will only have ""committed"" Brexiteers in her top team until Britain's EU exit is sorted out.

The former work and pensions secretary, who is considered an outsider in the contest to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister, said MPs must ""believe in Brexit"" to be part of her Cabinet.

""I believe at the moment we actually have to have a team that believes in Brexit,"" she told LBC radio.

""This is the most difficult delivery that we have got to give and we have got to give it by October 31.

""I think you need to have people who believe in Brexit to deliver this by October 31.""

Mrs May will resign as party leader on Friday, with the process to choose her successor kicking off on Monday.

A new PM is expected to be in place by the end of July.

Ahead of this, candidates have continued making their pitches for the job.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said leaving the EU without a deal is ""not a credible option"" and pledged to renegotiate the Political Declaration - the second part of the Brexit deal on the table that covers the future relationship between Brussels and London.

Mr Hancock said the ""most urgent"" task facing the next PM was to strike a Brexit deal that faced up to what he said were ""hard truths"".

""A credible plan to deliver Brexit must be grounded in reality and the reality is there are hard truths,"" he told a Policy Exchange event.

Theresa May: The highs and lows

""The first hard truth - no deal is not a credible policy choice available to the next prime minister.

""As the speaker has made clear, Parliament will block it as it did in March.

""That means the alternative is either a deal to leave the EU or a general election or second referendum and potentially no Brexit at all.""

Taking a different tack to some other contenders, he said there was no need to rip up the deal Mrs May negotiated with Brussels.

Mr Hancock said he would set up a Border Council to make sure there was no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland and to set a time limit on the backstop.

Mr Hancock said he agreed with Boris Johnson, who said the party faced ""potential extinction"" if they did not deliver Brexit.

The former foreign secretary - who is regarded as the front runner in the contest - made the comments in the first hustings of the campaign in Westminster on Tuesday.

But Mr Hancock said there needed to be a ""progressive, optimistic, centrist force in British politics"" - and said one of his priorities would be ""fully funded public services"".

International Development Secretary Rory Stewart has pledged to rule out a no-deal exit from the EU.

He said he would protect the party's ""reputation for economic competence"", which he said meant ""taking no deal off the table"" and delivering a ""pragmatic deal"" providing the ""right environment for investment"".

Mr Stewart said his number one priority would be to ""maintain and deepen"" the UK's economic stability, which he said would involve ruling out unfunded spending commitments and avoiding ""big promises of tax cuts that we cannot afford or that don't add up"".

Image: Rory Stewart has also spoken out against a no-deal exit

Meanwhile, pro-second referendum candidate Sam Gyimah has been setting out his process for holding another public vote.

The former minister, who announced his candidacy live on Sky News at the weekend, said MPs would be given one final change to agree a Brexit deal before the decision was put back to the people.

He said the new PM should get a ""final chance to succeed where Theresa May failed"".

But alongside this, Mr Gyimah said he would begin the process of legislating for a second referendum.

Gyimah: 'I am offering true conservatism'

The options on the ballot would be a no-deal Brexit, a revised deal or staying in the EU.

These latest comments come after the party changed its rules for leadership elections in order to eliminate candidates with little support.

The move is intended to reduce the crowded field to replace Mrs May, amid fears the party must avoid weeks of ""navel gazing"".

Two candidates dropped out on Tuesday - Brexit minister James Cleverly and housing minister Kit Malthouse.

230,Farage could be banned from making European Parliament victory speech,Aubrey Allegretti,"Nigel Farage insisted the money received was not for 'political purposes'

Nigel Farage could be temporarily banned from the European Parliament, after he refused to give evidence to an investigation into whether he broke its funding rules.

The Brexit Party leader has been summoned to a committee on the ""conduct of members"" to answer why he did not declare gifts worth £450,000.

An MEP who called for the probe says Leave campaign donor Arron Banks gave him the money to ""fund a lavish lifestyle"".

Image: The Brexit Party came top of the election poll with 29 MEPs last month

Mr Farage dismissed the ""kangaroo court"" and the 24 hours of notice he received, vowing to boycott the meeting.

It means his defence will not be used when the committee makes a recommendation to the European Parliament president.

Penalties he could face include a ban from the building in Strasbourg and losing his daily allowance.

Despite leading his new party to the top of the polls in last month's Euro election, he may be unable to join his fellow 29 MEPs in making victory speeches when the new parliament officially opens on 2 July.

Catherine Bearder, the Lib Dem MEP who called for an investigation into Mr Farage's funding, said there was ""no reference"" to his reported travel or accommodation in the parliament's register.

She pointed out Mr Banks, who set up the Leave.EU campaign in the run up to the 2016 referendum, is being investigated by the National Crime Agency.

:: Listen to All Out Politics on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

The NCA said in November there were ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect Mr Banks was not the true source of £8m in loans made to an organisation which ran his campaign.

A ""number of criminal offences may have been committed"", it added.

Mr Banks said at the time he was ""pleased"" to have the chance to ""finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations levelled against me and my colleagues"".

Image: Mr Banks is being investigated by the National Crime Agency

Mr Farage has defended the sums he was paid, saying he ""did not receive any private money for political purposes"".

""If they try to bar me from the building, who else gives voice to the thousands of people who voted for me?"" he added.
