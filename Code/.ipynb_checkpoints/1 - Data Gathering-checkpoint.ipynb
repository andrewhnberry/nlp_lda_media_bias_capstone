      "Mario may be a platforming icon, but he's also starred in some fantastic RPGs over the years, and the pinnacle of his role-playing exploits remains Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Released on the GameCube back in 2004, The Thousand-Year Door was a charming, light-hearted adventure that featured some of the most endearing characters to ever appear in the Mario series, and it's long overdue for a re-release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the first Paper Mario game for the Nintendo 64, TTYD was a unique hybrid of a platformer with an RPG, mixing light platforming elements with turn-based battles against some of the franchise's most common enemies. While the fundamentals of the battle system remained unchanged, developer Intelligent Systems embellished it with some clever touches. This time, each battle unfolded in front of an audience. If you timed your attacks well, the audience would throw you helpful items and fill your star meter, which in turn allowed you to pull off special moves. Conversely, if you whiffed your timing often enough, the audience would pelt you, making every encounter fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what solidified TTYD as an instant classic was its hilarious story. The plot whisked Mario through a variety of outlandish scenarios, from a WWE-like fighting promotion (where he was given the ring name \"The Great Gonzales\" because 'Mario' wasn't marketable enough) to a twilit town whose residents would transform into pigs every time the bell tolled. After TTYD, the Paper Mario series would head in a more platform-oriented direction, shedding many of the elements that made the first two entries so beloved. Whatever you think of the more recent games, there's no denying the series has yet to match the heights of The Thousand-Year Door, and it would be wonderful to be able to replay it again on Switch.\n",
      "Xbox Game Pass subscribers are spoiled for choice, with huge first-party titles like Gears 5 and Sea of Thieves, AAA masterpieces like Devil May Cry V and Yakuza 0, and a glut of well-regarded indies like Two Point Hospital and Subnautica to play through. Even Grand Theft Auto V is available on there now, which could easily consume hundreds of hours (if you haven't already jumped in).\n",

We're not just interested in the absolute best games on Xbox Game Pass--we went searching for the undiscovered gems, the Game Pass gold that you skipped over while scrolling down the list, not realizing what you were missing out on. Here are just a few of the hidden gems tucked away in the subscription service.\n",
      "In many ways, 2019 felt like a transitional period for TV. After much build-up, Disney and Apple launched their own much-hyped streaming platforms at the tail end of the year, and they will be joined in 2020 by a variety of other services, including WarnerMedia's HBOMax and Peacock from NBCUniversal--as well as the recently released Quibi. For the first time in years, Netflix's dominance over the streaming market is in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while the future of streaming is uncertain, for now, it's great news for audiences. In order to gain subscribers in this highly competitive market, all the platforms and networks had lined up a seriously impressive slate of shows in 2020. We were all set to enjoy a mix of returning series, new adaptations of much-loved novels and comic books, and some intriguing new titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course, a lot has changed since the start of the year. The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has caused major disruption across the entire entertainment industry, with shows and movies getting postponed and delayed on what feels like a daily basis. As a result, many of the series that were scheduled for the next few months won't appear until later in 2020--and shows that we expected to premiere in the fall may not arrive until 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, there's plenty to look forward to, even if we have to wait a while to see it. And there are shows being released over the next few months, including the highly anticipated third season of Killing Eve, the new DC series Stargirl, and a variety of titles debuting on the new short-form video platform Quibi. So here's our guide to the biggest series to watch in 2020 and beyond...\n",
      "While TV has created some huge stars, the fact remains that most television actors are ultimately expendable. While the main cast of beloved shows like Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and Game of Thrones have been able to command huge salaries on back of those shows' massive popularity, they're not exactly the the standard. Many actors are rarely more important than the series they act on, and stars are often written out of a show when they decide to leave (or are fired).\n",
      "\n",
      "But while a main character might simply be killed off or moved out of town once an actor leaves the role, there's an even easier solution for smaller roles and supporting cast members--simply change the actor. The producers of Friends weren't about to recast, say, Ross, but switching the actor who played his ex-wife was no problem. Similarly, characters played by younger children frequently have to be recast when the kids grow up, go to school, or simply leave the profession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actor switches happen all the time, and many go unnoticed by viewers. But there have been some bigger ones over the years. Some of these were smaller roles in huge shows, and some surprisingly big switches that were unavoidable to keep the series going. And some were totally deliberate recastings. So here are 11 key actor changes that have taken place over the years.\n",

Whether you're playing a cooperative game where your group is working toward a common goal or a competitive game where each player has secret strategies and interests, many board games have a way of sucking you into their worlds with their gorgeous artwork, vivid writing, and role-playing aspects that have you take on the identity of an individual character.

      "\n",
      "One can't have a list of the best board games without mentioning Gloomhaven, which multiple GameSpot staffers listed among their personal top three. There's a reason this 2017 tactical combat game maintains the No. 1 ranking on BoardGameGeek, the go-to board game site for many tabletop fans. Gloomhaven is a massive multi-session campaign where each person plays a wandering adventurer who develops their own skills and reasons for traveling over the course of the game, working together as a group to explore ruins, fight through dungeons, and gather loot (all represented by different game pieces and tokens). Throughout the game, you'll make decisions that affect the ever-branching story, and each character has their own secret motives as well. Combat takes place on a grid that changes with each battle and involves drawing cards that determine your available actions, all without the need for dice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloomhaven can look intimidating--its box weighs 22 pounds--but I've personally found it quite easy to pick up the rules and start playing (as someone who finds tabletop RPGs like D&D overwhelming). There's also a digital adaptation in early access on Steam. Gloomhaven's campaign is much more focused on tactical combat than roleplaying, but if you're into turn-based strategy and storylines that are deeply impacted by your actions, you're in for a real treat with Gloomhaven.\n",

      "Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 ranks right behind Gloomhaven on BoardGameGeek's list of the best board games, and it happens to be one of our favorites as well. This is a legacy-style board game, which means you play through it over multiple sessions, with choices made in one session permanently changing how the story plays out. Legacy games often require physically altering the game--writing on cards, ripping some of them up, and placing stickers on various parts. Because of this, a legacy game is played out in a single campaign that you can only experience once per copy of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandemic Legacy is one of the best legacy games you can buy, and it currently has two seasons available. The co-op campaign will be played over the course of 12-24 sessions with two to four players (ideally four), so you'll need a group that's in it for the long haul. Your group will play as disease-fighting experts whose mission is to treat disease hotspots and research cures for each of the four plagues before a pandemic occurs, with unique roles such as Medic and Scientist that allow special rules for each player. New mechanics and twists are revealed over the course of the game, and intense cooperation is required as you race against time to find a cure and fight back against the looming pandemic.\n",

Perfect for fans of horror or story-driven games, Betrayal begins with a group of people exploring a haunted house, drawing tiles as they enter a new room, with various events or items possible within. About halfway through the game, a \"haunt\" will be triggered, and one of the players will become the traitor, with the remaining players racing against the clock to meet their win condition before the traitor meets theirs. With 50 different scenarios in the base game--and another 50 added with the Widow's Walk expansion--there are numerous ways Betrayal can play out, but it's always a blast. Turn on some spooky music, dim the lights, and you've got yourself the perfect horror-themed board game night.\n",

      "Don't be fooled by the adorable woodland creatures on its cover--Root is an asymmetrical war game that's fairly complex, and you'll probably need to play multiple times to fully get the hang of it. In Root, multiple factions are fighting for control of a forest kingdom: Marquise de Cat, who wants to harvest the woodland's resources; the Eyrie Dynasty, birds who aim to build roosts throughout the forest as quickly as possible; the Woodland Alliance, forest creatures who build hideouts and spread sympathy for their cause; and the solo Vagabond, a warrior who moves through the woodland alone, forming alliances where it suits his own needs. Because each faction has completely different rules and goals, you'll want to play as each group at least once. But while it takes some time to master, Root is an absolute blast to play as you experiment with different strategies and slowly learn how to play each faction well. With its charming art design, variety of playstyles and great replayability, Root is a fantastic game to pick up if you have a group that's willing to master it over multiple sessions. It's also getting an official digital release on Steam, iOS, and Android later this year.\n",

Scythe is set in an alternative history of 1920s Europe, which is recovering from a great war. Players control one of five factions that are competing to claim the stake in the land around a mysterious city-state known as the Factory, which played a major role in the great war with its armored mechs. As an engine-building game, players aim to build structures, upgrade their actions, enlist new recruits, and more to grow their riches and complete certain goals. And if you're looking to play solo, the Automa mode throws in an AI opponent, using a deck of cards to determine its actions. With stunning artwork and deep world-building, Scythe is one of the best board games we've played, and it's a great option for fans of resource management, territory control, and general empire-building.\n",

From the Kraken and Cyber Bunny to the Meka Dragon and Alienoid, you'll wield the fierce power of one of six monsters, aiming either to destroy Tokyo by garnering 20 victory points or to be the only monster still standing at the end. You'll roll dice to determine your actions and potentially gain victory points, and special playing cards will give your monster a new effect, like a second head that lets you roll an extra die, body armor, and more. King of Tokyo is easy to learn, and each round lasts only about a half-hour, making this a quick and fun tabletop game to teach to a new group.\n",

      "Blood Rage is a board game inspired by Norse mythology, casting you and your fellow players as Vikings during the time of Ragnarok. Your ultimate goal is to go out with a bang, earning glory to secure your place in Valhalla, and there are several strategies you can adopt to achieve this. At the beginning of each round, or \"Age\" (there are three), you'll be dealt cards called Gods' Gifts, giving you various abilities that you can then craft your strategy around. You'll use the game's resource, Rage, to perform actions, and winning a battle isn't always the goal--sometimes, you'll win glory (points) for being defeated. At the end of each Age, a piece of the board is removed, and anyone on that portion is sent to Valhalla, earning even more glory for the players whose forces were there. With detailed miniatures and fantastic artwork, Blood Rage is an excellent strategy game where the end goal isn't survival, but earning the most glory before you take your place at Odin's side in Valhalla.\n",

      "Inspired by the H.P. Lovecraft novella, Mountains of Madness casts you and your friends as scientific explorers scaling a mysterious mountain in the middle of Antarctica. The problem: The higher you and your party climb, the more the mountain will begin to affect your mental health. To ascend the mountain, you and your team must pass a series of timed challenges that require quick and effective communication to pool a certain number of cards, and this task becomes much harder as your team begins to collect madness cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madness cards are the core mechanic driving the chaos in this game, as they add new rules that make communicating increasingly hard. There are three levels of madness cards, and you may have to \"upgrade\" to a harder one if you and your team even partially fail a task (and you will...trust me). Madness cards will ask you to do things like shake hands with every player before talking about a task, say numbers as addition problems (\"2+3\" instead of \"5\"), or remain quiet unless someone directly addresses you. Needless to say, Mountains of Madness descends into chaos as the madness cards get more ridiculous and the tasks get more difficult. It's a hard game to win, but that doesn't make it any less fun.\n",

Each time that number is rolled, anyone with a settlement adjacent to that tile will get resources, and you can build new roads and settlements using the resources you gather. The goal is to be the first to get 10 points, which you can achieve by building settlements, having the longest road, and more.\n",

This can completely change your strategy and requires you to consider wall defense on top of managing your resources and settlements.\n",

The game's premise is that you're an artist decorating the walls of the Portuguese king's palace, but you're competing against other players to complete a full row of tiles on your player board first. To do this, players take turns drafting tiles from the center of the table, placing them in a repository on the left side of your board. At the end of a round, you'll move one tile from your repository onto the corresponding row on your wall in a colored space that matches the tile. After someone completes a full row and the game ends, players can earn bonus points for their number of horizontal and vertical lines and for filling all tiles of a certain color, so there are multiple scoring conditions to keep in mind beyond just filling a single row.\n",

You'll also get special abilities and perks from the birds you have in play.\n",

In Coup, you're the head of a power-hungry family in an Italian city-state, manipulating your way to the top of a corrupt court. Here's how it works: A 15-card deck in the middle of the table contains multiples of five different characters, each of whom has a unique ability, and each player starts with two face-down character cards. Because no one knows which cards you have, you can bluff and use a character's unique ability, like stealing from the treasury or attempting an assassination, even if you don't have that card in your hand. At any time, another player can challenge whether you actually have that card. If you do have the card in your hand and choose to prove it, they'll have to lose one of their cards. On the other hand, if you're bluffing or choose not to reveal the card in your hand, you'll lose one of your own cards, turning it face-up on the table. If both of your characters get turned face-up, you're out of the game. Coup is easy to learn, and rounds will only take you about 15 minutes to play, making it a great game to whip out at parties.\n",

Each player has a stash of buttons, which you use to purchase tiles for your quilt, and you'll also keep track of your progress on a separate time board, which will net you more buttons and tiles as you progress. By the end of the game, you'll be scored based on how many buttons you have left, subtracting 2 points for each empty tile still left on your board. Patchwork is a relaxing game to play--there's something satisfying about fitting tiles together and searching for the perfect piece to fill space on your board, even when there's no hand-eye coordination involved. Two-player board games like Patchwork are also nice to have around if you live with just one other person, as you'll always have a game you can play together.\n",

      "Despite their similar names, Mansions of Madness has nothing to do with another game on this list, Mountains of Madness, although both are inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Instead, the premise of Mansions of Madness is much more similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill--you and your group will enter an eerie mansion, explore its hallways and rooms, find items, and encounter horrors that will test your sanity. In Mansions, however, you can see the full layout of the board from the start, including the location of clues, and the scenario for a playthrough is in effect from the beginning. While the first edition of Mansions required one player to take the antagonistic role of Keeper, who actively works against the other players, the second edition introduced a free companion app that absorbs this role and allows the game to be completely co-op or even single-player.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second edition's base game comes with four different scenarios, with more available through paid DLC. With that in mind, Mansions of Madness is a bit pricey at $100--and that's not including all the available expansions you can purchase as well. However, this is a high-quality board game with detailed miniatures and tiles made to last, and its thrilling scenarios require deep strategy and cooperation that will keep your team fully engaged over the course of a two-to-three-hour playthrough.\n",

      "Another two-player board game, Fog of Love is a romantic drama played out in tabletop form. In this game, you and the other player will play as two characters who meet, fall in love, and navigate the ups and downs of a modern relationship. You'll have awkward encounters, funny moments, and painful situations to work through, and the decisions you each make in these moments will affect your character's satisfaction and traits, which in turn affect whether you achieve your long-term goals. There's also a possibility for one or both players to have hidden secrets, which will be revealed at the end and may affect the outcome. Like any relationship, your characters may find true love or end up heartbroken at the end, but the act of playing out this story together makes Fog of Love a truly unique and compelling experience.\n",

      "Codenames is a ridiculously fun turn-based game that works with a larger group or even just two people (ideally, you'd have at least four). In Codenames, you have two rival spymasters, each of whom knows the identities of 25 secret agents, which are reflected by their codenames on a 5x5 grid. Each spymaster's teammates are trying to make contact with all of their agents before the other team. To do this, spymasters give one-word clues that could point to any number of codenames on the grid; for example, \"animal\" could refer to codenames like \"Cat,\" \"Dog,\" and \"Turkey.\" Players have to guess which codenames on the board belong to their team's spies while also avoiding codenames that could belong to the other team. Some cards on the grid are neutral, belonging to no team, and there's also an assassin--flip that card, and the game is over.\n",

      "Codenames is super easy to learn, and the variety of codename combinations available keeps each round interesting. And like many games on this list that have become incredibly popular, Codenames has quite a few sequels that switch up the theme and gameplay, such as Codenames: Duet (a two-player co-op variant), Codenames: Harry Potter (featuring the popular series' characters perfect for your family game night) and Codenames: Deep Undercover (a mature version intended for players 18+ that adds some of the appeal of games like Cards Against Humanity).\n",
      "Netflix's latest docuseries The Tiger King has taken the world by storm. The seven-episode show follows Joe Exotic, an exotic pets park owner; Carole Baskin, an animal activist; Doc Antle, another exotic pets park owner; and everyone that surrounds them. It is an unbelievable story that starts with petting tigers and ends with assassination attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes this show so mind-blowing is the cast of characters. Aside from the three previously mentioned folks, there is a plethora of other people interviewed for the show that are incredibly interesting. However, many of these people aren't really good, law-abiding citizens, or they had a rough past that led to some tragic moments. All that being said, sometimes you feel guilty about liking some of the characters on this show.\n",

      "One thing Gargano is known for is his comic book-inspired cosplay. In the past, Gargano has had ring attire that pays homage to Marvel characters like Star Lord, Punisher, Captain Marvel, and our personal favorite, Iron Man. However, now that Gargano has gone heel, will those cosplays keep happening? According to Johnny Wrestling himself, don't count on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"[The Johnny Gargano] character is changing and evolving, so I do not know if there will be another Marvel-inspired gear,\" Gargano told GameSpot. \"Well, that's the first I've ever said that on record, but I'm not really sure if that's where it is headed. In my head--in my character's head--he did a lot of things that put smiles on fan faces to make people happy, but it was very much of a detriment to himself. That's the reason he brought back DIY. That's the reason he [teamed] with Tomasso [Ciampa] again, even though he had ill will towards Tomasso. So I don't know. I don't know if there will ever be another Marvel cosplay. I don't know if they'll another Marvel inspiration. You'll have to watch and find out, but we'll see what happens.\"\n",

      "Horror comes in many forms, from monsters and ghosts to psychotic killers and crazy cults. But there's nothing quite like body horror to separate the hardcore fright fan from the more casual viewer. The phrase 'body horror' was first coined in the British academic journal Screen in 1986, and it loosely describes movies where the terror comes from the human body itself, whether it's melting, mutating, or perhaps hosting some terrifying parasite.\n",
      "\n",
      "1986 was also the year that David Cronenberg's classic The Fly brought the sub-genre to a wide mainstream audience. But while Cronenberg remains the godfather of body horror, there are many other movies that have delighted in disturbing audiences with disgusting flesh-based shocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of body horror movies available right now on a variety of streaming services, including Netflix, Prime, and Shudder. With so many of us stuck at home right now, there's never been a better time for horror fans to explore some weird and gory sub-genres--and it doesn't get weirder or gorier than body horror. So here are some of the gloopiest, goriest, and most gruesome body horror classics you can check out right now...\n",

      "Still, with so many streaming services--and so many options available on each--it could become pretty hard to narrow down what to watch, especially if you're looking for a TV show rather than a movie. Do you want a sitcom or a sketch series? Are you interested in a beloved series or a more obscure pick?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Netflix remains the reigning king of the streaming wars, you don't actually have to look any further to find the show that's right for you, whether you're looking for a rewatch or a first-time binge. To make things a bit easier, though, GameSpot has put together a list of the 22 best comedies the service has to offer--and there's something for just about everyone.

      "\n",
      "April sees the streaming giant focusing on many of its original shows and movies, both new releases and older favorites back for new seasons. There are a few must-see family titles for parents at home with their kids away from school. The Big Show Show is a WWE series that features the wrestling star of the title playing a fictional version of himself who has to cope with modern family life. That's not the only WWE title arriving next month either--the movie The Main Event features Kofi Kingston, The Miz, and Sheamus in a movie about an aspiring 11-year-old wrestler who discovers a magical mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other family titles include The Willoughbys, which is an animated comedy with a cast that features Jane Krakowski (30 Rock), Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaids), and The Office creator Ricky Gervais. Anyone who saw Netflix's last animated movie, the Oscar-nominated Klaus, knows that the bar has been set high for the company's animated output, so hopefully this will be just as good. Another must-see release is Middleditch & Schwartz, which sees two of TV's most talented comedy actors team up. Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch and Parks and Recreation's Ben Schwartz appear in this entirely improvised three-part special, based on their popular live show.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also some great movies hitting Netflix too. The fourth Matrix film is set for release next year, so get ready for that, you can check out the previous three movies in the hugely successful sci-fi series. Admittedly, the original Matrix is way better than the next two, Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions. But for those viewers who haven't seen them since 2003, this is a perfect opportunity to revisit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another '90s sci-fi movie getting a new version next year is Mortal Kombat. While the history of video game adaptations isn't exactly filled with good movies, the 1992 version of the classic game is actually one of the better examples, as it sensibly avoids a lot of plot and sticks to the fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as anime goes, Seasons 4 and 5 of the hit series Bleach are arriving on April 21. Based on the manga by Tite Kubo of the same name, Bleach follows Ichigo Kurosaki, a person who gains the powers of a Soul Reaper--a Death God, similar to the Grim Reaper. He defends humans from spirits and helps others find the afterlife. There are 16 seasons in total--with Season 17 arriving next year--so there is plenty of time to catch up. However, beginning on April 21, Netflix will only have Seasons 1-5.\n",

      "Over the last decade, Funko has mined Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe to produce new versions of its iconic vinyl figure. All told, more than 600 Marvel-themed Funko Pop figures have been released since 2011, and plenty more are on the way, including Pops based on the upcoming Marvel's Avengers game. The heroes of the Marvel universe (along with tons of Star Wars figures) have led the charge for Funko, helping to turn the beady-eyed figures into a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, the sheer volume of Marvel Pops can make it hard to pick and choose which ones are worth adding to your shelf. This isn't Pokemon; you don't need to collect 'em all. We looked at every Marvel Pop in existence and whittled the collection down to the 20 best Marvel Funko Pops every Marvel fan should own.\n",
      "\n",
      "We strove to choose characters across a wide array of Marvel franchises to avoid repetition. I could've filled a big chunk of the list with Baby Groot, but I practiced self-control and include other Marvel characters. Instead, you'll find a sampler platter of Pops that will hopefully point you in the direction of a few new figures to add to your collection. This list will be added to over time as more Marvel Pops release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Marvel Funko Pops\n",
      "\n",
      "Stan Lee (Patina) #7 | $9.60\n",
      "\n",
      "Without Stan Lee, it's hard to say what Marvel would look like today. It's also a safe bet that many of the Marvel Funko Pops available today wouldn't even exist. So, it's fitting to kick off this list with a Funko Pop celebrating the late comic book icon. The patina finish makes this Stan Lee Pop look like a miniature bronze statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iron Spider with Nano Gauntlet #574 | $11\n",
      "\n",
      "There are far more Spider-Man Funko Pops than any one Spidey fan probably needs, so honing in on the best one isn't an easy task. The Iron Spider Armor suit with the Nano Infinity Gauntlet attached turned Tom Holland's Peter Parker into, well, a machine for fighting baddies in Avengers: Endgame. It takes the prize as the best Spider-Man Pop for two reasons: it hails from an iconic scene in Endgame, and it simply looks incredibly cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain America with Broken Shield & Mjolnir #573 | $13.48\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve Rogers picking up Thor's Mjolnir hammer was easily one of the most surprising moments not just in Endgame, but throughout the entire MCU. It came at an important moment and helped turn the tides in the battle against Thanos. Captain America is worthy of Mjolnir, and this Funko Pop celebrating his most iconic moment is worthy of a place on your shelf. The fact that he's holding his broken shield makes it an even more interesting Pop. I'd say this Pop is one of the best conversation starters, too. You and your friends can partake in heated debates about what it means to be \"worthy\" of Mjolnir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baby Groot #202 | $15\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to Baby Yoda's arrival in The Mandalorian, Baby Groot was the cutest baby creature in existence. He's still extremely adorable. There's not much more that needs to be said about the greatest guardian of the galaxy. Just look at how cute he is as a Funko Pop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hulk Buster #294 | $15.51\n",
      "\n",
      "Appropriately super-sized, Hulk Buster from Avengers: Infinity War and Age of Ultron is a six-inch Pop that looks more like a regular action figure than a conventional vinyl Pop. A vital weapon in the fight against Thanos at the Battle of Wakanda, the Hulk Buster stands out as one of the coolest power suits created by Tony Stark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rocket with Groot #211 | $25\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it cheating to include a second Funko Pop featuring Baby Groot? Rocket Raccoon holding dual pistols is a fun enough Pop by itself, but look at Baby Groot hanging onto his buddy's head. The contrast between Rocket's serious face and Baby Groot's joyful grin is pretty funny, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold Doctor Strange #439 | $16\n",
      "\n",
      "The mystical Stephen Strange feels like one of the most fitting candidates for a gold Funko Pop, and this Doctor Strange Funko, though simplistic, doesn't disappoint. I especially like the rigid pattern on his cape and sash. Gold Doctor Strange is part of the Marvel Studios 10th Anniversary Pop collection and comes with a plastic protective case.\n",
      "\n",
      "GwenPool #197 | $11\n",
      "\n",
      "GwenPool is Wade Wilson meets Gwen Stacy. Marvel created her character in 2015 after Spider-Gwen proved popular. Although GwenPool has her own comic series and has appeared in numerous video games, she hasn't arrived in the MCU or X-Men film series. That said, she's one of the most interesting recently created characters under the Marvel umbrella, and this Pop perfectly depicts her style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wolverine #547 | $6.25\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it's a treat to go back to the beginning and see where it all started. This Pop figure portrays Wolverine's first appearance, which came in The Incredible Hulk #180 in 1974. Though not a retro collectible by any means, this Wolverine Pop certainly looks pulled straight from the panels of old comics rather than 21st-century movies--and that's pretty neat, if you ask me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanos Snap Deluxe #556 | $25\n",
      "\n",
      "A Marvel Funko Pop list wouldn't be complete without the Mad Titan, and this six-inch, super sized Pop depicts Thanos' most infamous moment: the finger snap that wiped out a significant portion of the world's population after he secured all six Infinity Stones. While that catastrophic Infinity War moment may have made you a bit weepy, you have to admit that this Pop is pretty darn cool. Look at the statue made of skulls!\n",
      "\n",
      "Deadpool the Duck #230 | $38.75\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like Gwenpool, Deadpool the Duck is an amalgamation of two heroes: Deadpool, of course, and Howard the Duck. The result is a zany five-issue arc that originally released in 2017. Deadpool the Duck is both adorable and ultra-violent. He's a conundrum, really. The Walgreens-exclusive Pop is hard to come by, but you can still find it at Amazon. In the comics, he likes both swords and guns, but only his trusty blades are included here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black Widow #604 | $8.57\n",
      "\n",
      "Black Widow will finally get her own feature film on November 6, so naturally, Funko is releasing new Black Widow Pops. Black Widow wearing her white suit really stands out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Classic Spider-Woman #392 | $17\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2018 New York Comic-Con exclusive, this Spider-Woman Pop depicts the classic heroine in her original suit, which makes it quite cool. Sony announced an animated feature film starring Spider-Woman in late 2018, but no release date has been set. It's safe to say more Spider-Woman Pops will be made when the movie hits theaters, but it'll be hard to top the design of the classic look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Marvel #459 | $5.26\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Marvel, the heroine who played a major role in saving the world in Avengers: Endgame, has a fittingly stoic pose in this Endgame-themed Pop. This isn't the only Carol Danvers Pop available, but it has the best design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nebula #456 | $6.25\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of all of the heroes in the MCU, I don't think any of them has had it as rough as Nebula, one of Thanos' adopted daughters who gets subjected to all sorts of terrible treatment. Nebula also has one of the most interesting character designs as a part-cyborg. That design is on display in this awesome Endgame Pop. Just please keep her away from any Thanos Pops you may own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Casual Thor #479 | $6.13\n",
      "\n",
      "For the vast majority of the three Thor films and Avengers movies, Thor is a thunder-creating god who seems appropriately otherworldly. In Endgame, however, we meet pizza-loving, sunglass-wearing, beer-belly-having Thor. Casual Thor is extremely relatable, and this Pop vinyl captures his laidback look to perfection. It's also a constant reminder that Casual Thor looks like he is the lead singer of an '80s hair band.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iron Man - Avengers Assemble Series #584 | $45\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Pop in the Funko Pop Avengers Assemble series, this Iron Man figure is awesome because of what it represents. The Avengers Assemble series recreates the poses from the first Avengers movie when the team begins fighting alongside one another. It's closer to a super-sized Pop, as it stands at 5.5 inches tall and has a 5-inch wide base. The remaining five figures in the Avengers Assemble Series will release throughout 2020, exclusively at Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black Panther #130 | $14.42\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on his debut appearance in Captain America: Civil War, this Black Panther Funko Pop is certainly simple. There's nothing fancy about it, but then again, Marvel's Black Panther has become so much of a cultural icon he doesn't need to strike a pose to look cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Star Lord #198 | $12.50\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it's just because I know Chris Pratt is Star-Lord, but this Funko Pop vinyl really does resemble Chris Pratt, right? That's no small feat considering many Pops have a similar style. Wearing casual clothes and holding a blaster in each hand, Star Lord is certifiably awesome. I especially like how one eyebrow is raised, making it look like Pratt is either confused or judging you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hank Pym #343 | $9\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant-Man and the Wasp is my personal favorite movie in the MCU, and the Ant-Man suit pops more than most superhero suits donned by heroes. For a Funko Pop, there's a lot of detail, and the red visor definitely stands out. Hank Pym is also probably more comfortable standing as a 3.75-inch figure than other heroes.\n",
      "Every year, the list of shows Netflix cancels gets longer. Given how they keep creating more and more programming, though, that's to be expected. Still, you might be surprised by some of the TV shows the streaming service has already cut short. From an interesting musical concept to some truly creepy horror entries, it's not as if Netflix is targeting a single general to get axed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there are success stories from Netflix's originals. Reality shows The Circle and Love is Blind were both recently renewed for two seasons each, meaning they'll be around for quite a while. For every show the streamer brings back, though, there are more left in the dust.\n",

Though not many are from the company itself, there are quite a few from third-party publishers that are well worth playing or getting excited about. The highly-anticipated Shenmue III is coming in November, which is crazy to think now since the game was originally announced on Sony's E3 stage in 2015. Another big exclusive is the next project from the studios that brought us Yakuza. Titled Judgement, the game looks to be quite a departure from the macho gangster drama of the Yakuza series.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're talking Sony itself, the one hugely-anticipated remaining exclusive confirmed for this year is none other than Death Stranding.

There are also a few smaller Sony exclusives, like the charming Concrete Genie and the MediEvill Remaster.\n",

      "Because it's not divided up into generations the way that consoles or handheld game systems are, PC has the broadest array of games you'll find anywhere. With the majority of those games playable on modern hardware, save for occasional instances where current operating systems don't support certain games, that means you have a Herculean task in front of you when deciding what to buy and play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, whereas console and handheld games see discounts on a more irregular basis, there are constantly sales on places like Steam, GOG, Humble, Itch.io, and so on. But sale or not, there are plenty of years-old games that are now low-priced but nevertheless worth playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, it can be downright overwhelming when you decide to pick up something you haven't played before. You have decades of games to choose from. Even if you set yourself a price limit--say, $20 in the US--that does very little to actually reduce the number of games you have to consider. And that's where we come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above, we're rounding up some of the best games you can find on PC for no more than $20. Because of the reality described above, this is far from comprehensive--it's simply impossible to highlight every noteworthy PC game that you can pick up for relatively cheap. But we've assembled a list of games that we think you'll be quite pleased to play, and we'll continue to expand the selection over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these games are regularly priced at no more than $20--whether or not there's a Steam sale going on. There's usually such a promotion not far off, which means you can get these already budget-priced games for even cheaper. But in the meantime, you can still get any of these at what's still a pretty reasonable price.\n",
      "E3 2018 is finally over, and that means news on countless new games are on the way, both in the short- and long-term. While much of the focus of the annual conference centered around the console manufacturers' respective media briefings, that doesn't mean that PC games weren't also a big part of the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case in point, there are tons of games for PC well worth looking forward to before the end of the year. That includes many of the big multiplatform games, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and Battlefield V.\n",
      "\n",
      "With so many games being announced and showcased at E3 2018, it can be tough keeping track of all of them and their respective release dates. After all, not everything at the show is scheduled to come out this year. To help keep you up to date with the biggest PC game you can expect to play this year, we've gathered all of the biggest ones here for your reference along with their release dates/windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "E3 2018 PC Games\n",
      "\n",
      "There's plenty else to look forward to on PC in 2018. While not following the same sort of structure as most company- and platform-specific press conferences, 2018 again saw the PC Gaming Show return, which yielded plenty of surprises. But which PC games are you most looking forward to? Let us know in the comments below.\n",
      "Whether they're direct continuations that carry on the events of the previous game or unrelated follow-ups that share a general theme, gamers love--and love to hate--video game sequels. While you can argue that the emphasis on sequels seems to overshadow the creation of new, original IP, sometimes sequels produce unique experiences in their own right. Like the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild--the characters and themes are the same, but the game was a refreshing take on the entire open-world genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sequels are a huge part of game development, but most creators shy away from revealing what they have in the works too early. But that doesn't stop up from speculating on what would be. So in this feature, we've gathered together our wishlist of games that deserve sequels, or unannounced games that potentially could be announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the games you'll see in this feature are a little more far-fetched than others; Grand Theft Auto VI, outside of Rockstar Games seeming like it always disappears off the face of the planet, is going to happen someday soon. There are already rumors circulating of a new Bioshock. But Bloodborne 2, Bully 3, and Portal 3? Those aren't necessarily guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't a definitive list of every game that we want a sequel to, but it represents some of the titles the GameSpot editors feel most strongly about and would love to see. What unannounced games do you hope get a surprise announcement at a gaming event? Let us know in the comments below!\n",

      "\n",
      "There were a lot of big game releases in 2019, as well as some big developments to the industry--but the most impactful changes of 2019 will bear fruit in 2020.\n",
      "A whole lot happened in 2019. The year saw some major games finally come to fruition, like the long-awaited Death Stranding from Kojima Productions, as well as some forward motion in new services like Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia. But looming over most of 2019 was something even larger: 2020. This year was full of forward-looking developments in gaming, setting up a year that has the potential to be littered with major moments and sweeping changes to the industry's landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are major games on the horizon, like The Last Of Us Part II or Cyberpunk 2077. More than that, though, are the moves developers, publishers, and major tech companies are making that could recontextualize the entire industry. New hardware is set to bring another technical leap forward in the console games we play. Major players are getting in on streaming and subscription services. Long-dormant franchises could see resurgences. And more and more companies are looking at new business models for their games--and trying to save games they've already released from rocky starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got our first look at what 2020 holds throughout 2019, and there's a lot that could bring major changes to the gaming industry in the very near future. Here's a rundown of everything that turned 2019 into the Year of 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next-Gen Consoles Are Coming\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing has quite an impact on the gaming landscape as new console hardware, and in 2019, we started getting details about what Sony and Microsoft have planned for the next console generation. Both the PlayStation 5 and the next Xbox, codenamed \"Project Scarlett,\" are slated for release in 2020 during the holiday season, which means the current console generation is quickly coming to an end. And that means we'll soon start to see a crop of games that show off the capabilities of the new hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both consoles will feature solid-state drives for storage, as opposed to the current hard disk standard, although neither has a price point yet. The PS5 is confirmed to include a disc drive and to support 4K Blu-ray discs, while reports on Microsoft's new Xbox suggest it has two versions, one of which may focus on streaming and forego a disc drive altogether, like the Xbox One S All-Digital. The PS5 is also confirmed to support backward compatibility with PS4 games and PlayStation VR. Scarlett looks slated for release during the 2020 holiday season, while the PS5 is confirmed to hit shelves in Holiday 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're sure to get more information about the future of PS5 and Project Scarlett throughout 2020, as well as some of the games that'll show up on them. The big question is what the new hardware will allow developers to do with their games that they couldn't before--something we're sure to see in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Year Of Streaming And Subscriptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from new Xbox hardware, Microsoft is making another big move in gaming in the form of its xCloud streaming technology. The service looks to make console-quality games playable on a variety of hardware, including on on PCs and Macs through their internet browsers and mobile devices, through online streaming. Given the robust library of Microsoft's Game Pass offerings, which make all first-party games and a variety of other titles available to subscribers on Xbox One and PC for a monthly fee, xCloud could be a formidable entrant into the widening field of streaming services--especially since Microsoft is packaging it with Xbox Game Pass in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google also recently launched its Stadia streaming service, which offers a lot of the same capabilities as what Microsoft is bringing with xCloud. While the service launched in 2019, Stadia saw something of a rocky launch, with a small library of games and a thin install base that made multiplayer games tough to enjoy. But while it might have struggled at launch, Google has invested in Stadia with a new studio headed up by Motive Studios and Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond. It seems likely we'll see Google continue to push Stadia's offerings and shore up its capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Microsoft mounting a streaming service and a heavy hitter like Google now on the gaming stage, it seems likely we'll see an uptick of emphasis on streaming from other players as well. Sony's PS Now service has existed for quite a while, though the publisher doesn't release first-party games on the service at launch. Sony recently dropped its price in a move that seems aimed to keep it competitive with Microsoft and Google's offerings. Ubisoft also recently announced a PC subscription service for its game catalog, called Uplay Plus, and there's Electronic Arts' Access subscriptions--EA Access on console and Origin Access on PC. We've also got the newly launched Apple Arcade service, a subscription for mobile games that works on iPhones, Macs, and Apple TV, and services such as Nvidia's GeForce Now, which lets you stream PC games you've purchased on various devices, including PCs, Macs, and Nvidia Shield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the new consoles' support for disc drives suggests we won't see the elimination of physical media in the next generation, 2020 looks to be a year in which many of us will have the option to get our games primarily through subscriptions, rather than buying discs or even digital purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Long Last: More Half-Life\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly the least-expected announcement of 2019 came from Valve: 2020 will see a new entry in the beloved Half-Life franchise. It also wasn't the game anyone expected. Valve isn't bringing a traditional Half-Life game to PC, in which you play as series protagonist Gordon Freeman. Instead, the next title will be Half-Life: Alyx, a virtual reality game that puts you in the shoes of Half-Life 2 character Alyx Vance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valve's also not advancing the story beyond where it left it with Half-Life 2: Episode 2 way back in 2007. Instead, Half-Life: Alyx takes place between the first two Half-Life games and looks like it'll focus on Alyx's relationship with her father, Eli Vance. Half-Life: Alyx will work with any VR platform that's compatible with SteamVR--meaning HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Media, and Valve's VR setup, Valve Index.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's not a ton of other information about the game just yet apart from Valve's announcement trailer. But if you've got VR equipment, we do know when you can play it: March 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blizzard's Resurgence\n",
      "\n",
      "BlizzCon 2019 was a huge one for the developer, full of announcements. Three of its franchises are seeing major continuations in the future (to say nothing of new content coming to Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm), and while we're not sure if they'll all come out in 2020, it's very possible we'll see some new Blizzard games in the coming year.\n",
      "\n",
      "After seven years since the release of Diablo 3, Blizzard dropped the bomb of Diablo 4 at the convention, showing off not just a new trailer for the game but a playable slice of the game. It makes some big changes to the franchise, taking some influences from live games. Instead of just playing cooperatively with other players in your party, Diablo 4's overworld is public, throwing you in with other players to meet, work with, or ignore, and adding elements like world bosses and public events to take part in as you explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blizzard also announced a sequel to its multiplayer hero shooter, Overwatch. Up to now, Overwatch has largely been a competitive multiplayer experience, with its broader story relegated to supplementary material like trailers and videos. Overwatch 2 will feature a story campaign and single-player activities, as well as cooperative missions--expanding on the story side of Overwatch and giving you new options to play. But the competitive part is still a huge part of the game, and Blizzard intends to avoid fracturing the current Overwatch community by making Overwatch and Overwatch 2 competitive gameplay compatible with each other. All new characters and maps will also be available in both games, so even if you choose not to buy Overwatch 2, you'll still be able to keep playing the game as you know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third of the big announcements is a new expansion for World of Warcraft. Shadowlands expands on Blizzard's 15-year-old MMO by taking players into Azeroth's afterlife, opening up a whole new area to explore, as well as expanding on lore that Blizzard has never really explored before. The expansion is also putting a big emphasis on player choice, allowing you to choose from a variety of factions to join in the Shadowlands, and providing specific endgame story campaigns based on your choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't know when exactly Blizzard will release any of those titles--and with Blizzard, it might be a while. A big showing at BlizzCon was welcome for the company, which was facing still-lingering controversy over its ruling against a Hearthstone player who expressed support for the Hong Kong protests. But BlizzCon 2019 set up the possibility for continuations of Blizzard's major franchises in 2020, and even if those games aren't actually playable next year, they're sure to be on a lot of minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "More Long-Awaited Releases\n",
      "\n",
      "While we haven't been waiting for them as long as we have for a new Half-Life game, there are a few other well-loved franchises finally getting their sequels (and remakes) in 2020. Square Enix is releasing the first episode of its Final Fantasy VII Remake in March, bringing the game back to the fore after 22 years. The first part of the remake covers the portion of Final Fantasy VII that takes place in Midgar, but we're still not sure how many episodes the game will span, how long it'll be in total, or when it'll all be released.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Last of Us Part II is finally poised for release in 2020 as well. The second part of Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic action-adventure game returns to the story of Joel and Ellie, but this time, Ellie is the player character throughout the game. Ellie has become a capable warrior in the years since The Last of Us, and she embarks on a revenge quest after a vicious attack on her friend and love interest Dina. We know she'll also work with other characters, including Joel, and that the game will be as bleak and story-focused as its predecessor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're also about to see the wait for CD Projekt Red's follow-up to The Witcher franchise, Cyberpunk 2077, come to an end. CD Projekt revealed a bunch of new details about the upcoming action-RPG in 2019, including the addition of actor Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand, a major character in the franchise. Cyberpunk 2077 looks to be about as expansive and detailed as The Witcher games, as players have come to expect, with plenty of options that let you alter your path through the game based on your choices, how you build your character, how you interact with the people you meet in the game, and how you approach its various combat encounters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft is set to continue the Halo franchise in 2020 as well, with Halo: Infinite, just in time for the launch of Project Scarlett. The game puts you back in the role of series protagonist Master Chief, though we don't know much else. The game is set for release on Xbox One and PC in Holiday 2020, while also serving as a launch title for Project Scarlett, with a beta coming before its launch that'll likely give a pretty strong look at the new Halo's multiplayer offerings.\n",
      "Overwatch 2 was confirmed during Blizzard's keynote speech at BlizzCon 2019, and many more details were revealed at a follow-up panel with Jeff Kaplan. It's a sequel that features a number of PvE scenarios through story missions and hero missions, and revamps PvP with extra maps and new modes. What's important is that Overwatch 1 and 2 will share the same competitive multiplayer environment; all PvP updates will come to both games and both player-bases can match up with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a new coat of paint is also coming to the Overwatch universe; in addition to an updated graphics engine, every hero is getting a redesign in Overwatch 2. While you'll keep all your cosmetics and progression from the original game, the characters' basic designs are changing. So far, Blizzard has revealed how seven of its heroes will look--Tracer, Mei, Winston, Genji, Reinhardt, Lucio, and Mercy. Check them out below. We'll update this as the rest of its roster--which is nearing the three-dozen mark--has its redesign revealed in the future.\n",
      "\n",

      "Star Citizen Creator Answers Fan Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "The developer's chairman answered questions on patches, in-game farming, and the features that are in the works.\n",
      "Star Citizen raised a lot of money in 2017. According to data collected by Polygon, the super-ambitious PC space sim raised $34.91 million last year, which is down from $36.11 million the year prior. In total, Star Citizen has raised an astonishing $175.9 million, according to the game's own publicly available funding data. Note that these figures do not include money given back via returns, but even with those accounted for, the number is surely still huge.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put the $34.91 million in perspective, it's more than double the money ($17.25 million) that the more than 700 Kickstarter video game projects brought in, combined, in 2017. It's been two years running that Star Citizen's own yearly funding tally has more than doubled the combined efforts of every video game project on Kickstarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Star Citizen launched on Kickstarter in 2012 and made its original funding goal of $500,000 in a week. The campaign ended with $2.1 million. Developer Cloud Imperium then shifting funding to its own website where it has brought in millions and millions through the sale of ships and, more recently, parcels of land throughout the in-game universe.\n",

      "In other Star Citizen news, Crytek is suing Cloud Imperium over breach of contract and copyright infringement claims. Crytek is suing based on the claim that the the Star Citizen studio did not live up to the promises it made for using Crytek's CryEngine. Cloud Imperium says the lawsuit is \"meritless\" and that it is prepared to fight \"vigorously\" in court if it has to.\n",

      "Following the announcement of the PlayStation 5's Holiday 2020 launch window, many details have spread about what to expect from Sony's next-gen console, including its games and logo. With ray-tracing capabilities, an SSD storage device, and an optical drive that supports 4K UHD discs, the PS5 is looking to be a substantial leap forward from the PS4. But with every reveal of a new console, the one thing that many users want to see is the controller itself--the device that will allow people to connect with the console and the games they'll play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rumors, a patent for the PS5's controller, which pointed to the return of the DualShock 4's touchpad but the removal of its light bar, and a few sparse details from Sony officials were the most fans got for a while. But now, PlayStation has finally announced the brand new PS5 controller: it's called the DualSense and we finally know what it looks like.\n",
      "\n",
      "PlayStation's DualShock has become one of gaming's most iconic controllers, possessing features that would go on to become a trailblazer within the market, so knowing we get a brand new PlayStation controller redesign along with the PS5 later this year is exciting. There's a lot to learn from PlayStation's history and how it created some of the most memorable devices in recent memory. With this in mind, let's take a look back at the history of PlayStation controllers, how they've helped shape nearly 25 years of gaming, and what's next for Sony with the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller.\n"

       "'Mr. Newsom said he is not interested in a “midway” deal requiring California to loosen its rules. “A rollback of auto emissions standards is bad for the climate and bad for the economy,” he wrote in an email. “I applaud the automakers for saying as much in their letter today to the President. We should keep working towards one national standard — one that doesn’t backtrack on the progress states like California have made.”\\n\\nThe letters are the latest twist in Mr. Trump’s effort to roll back regulations on auto manufacturing, an industry he has vowed to support. Some industry chief executives and lobbyists have been privately telling the White House for months that the president’s efforts may do more harm than good, but Thursday’s action represents a particularly strong pushback.\\n\\n“Our thinking is, the rule is still being finalized, there is still time to develop a final rule that is good for consumers, policymakers and automakers,” said Gloria Bergquist, a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\\n\\nCriticizing the president’s plan comes with risk for the automakers. The White House has courted their support for his moves, and, privately, some officials have said that they fear industry criticism could lead the president to retaliate by imposing tariffs on auto imports. That, too, could be painful, because many cars and components are now made or partly assembled across the border in Mexico or Canada.\\n\\nBut they also fear the costs of the uncertainty and regulatory headaches that potentially await them should Mr. Trump’s rollback go through as planned.\\n\\nFor example, automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell in California is much higher than in states like Utah, where the new Trump standard of about 37 miles per gallon would be in effect.\\n\\nBut because Americans increasingly prefer SUVs over thriftier vehicles, manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high-mileage states, a potentially money-losing proposition, while raising the prices of gas guzzlers. At the same time, auto lots in low-mileage states might hold a completely different mix of vehicles at different prices.'"
