He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr Khan said \"childish insults\" should be beneath the US president, adding: \"Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country, warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe.\"\n\nMr Khan was not the only target of the president's tweets.

Show Hide Travelling Trumps When Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, arrive for a state visit to the UK on 3 June, they will reportedly be joined by the president\u2019s four adult children and their spouses. Here's who is in the family entourage: Ivanka Trump Ivanka is Trump\u2019s oldest daughter and works in the White House (unpaid) as an adviser to the president. Trump has relied on her often for overseas diplomacy, including sitting in for him briefly at a G20 summit, and he said he had considered naming her to head the World Bank. She has visited Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast on behalf of the administration to promote women\u2019s rights. Before her father\u2019s presidency, Trump ran her own fashion line. Jared Kushner Trump\u2019s son-in-law is a White House senior adviser and the administration\u2019s envoy to the Middle East (also unpaid). With his wife Ivanka he has also been the subject of a host of controversies \u2013 with a whistleblower alleging they were granted sensitive security clearances over the objections of career security experts. He has also been accused of conflicts of interest over his family\u2019s sprawling real-estate empire. Kushner wears many hats in Washington. He is supposed to come up with a Middle East peace plan, as well as US immigration policy. Donald Trump Jr Trump\u2019s eldest son and his brother, Eric, run their father\u2019s business empire while he is in the White House. Officially, Trump Jr is executive vice-president of the Trump Organization. It was Trump Jr who met a Russian lawyer in an infamous Trump Tower meeting in New York in 2016, after the Russian offered him election \u2018dirt\u2019 on the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Kushner also attended. Although accepting campaign help from foreign nationals is illegal, the special counsel Robert Mueller said after investigating that there was not enough evidence to prove meeting participants knew they were breaking the law. Trump Jr may be accompanied by his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host. Eric Trump Eric Trump is the co-leader of the Trump Organization during his father\u2019s presidency. He has defended his father from accusations of racism, and called the president\u2019s critics \u201cnot even people\u201d. He is parodied on the weekly US satirical comedy TV show Saturday Night Live and elsewhere as the not-so-sharp Trump brother, though supporters call this portrayal inaccurate. Most recently, a watchdog group has been pressing to find out how much it cost taxpayers when Eric and members of one of the family\u2019s golf clubs travelled to Scotland to play the links. Lara Trump Lara Trump is a campaign adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and wife to Eric. A vocal defender of her father-in-law, she recently made headlines by saying the decision to let in large numbers of migrants fleeing war- and poverty-torn countries for Europe was \u201cone of the worst things that ever happened to Germany\u201d.\n\nTiffany Trump Tiffany is the lowest profile of Trump\u2019s adult children and his only child with second wife Marla Maples. She headed to London ahead of the rest of her family. The 25-year-old is a graduate student at Georgetown Law in Washington DC. She travelled to the Cannes film festival earlier this month with her wealthy boyfriend, in a trip that has drawn scrutiny over its cost to taxpayers in terms of security for the presidential daughter.\n\nHowever, by the time the president\u2019s helicopter, Marine One, landed at Buckingham Palace for his long-desired ceremonial visit, he was wreathed in smiles, with his arrival marked by two 41-gun salutes, a guard of honour and a white-tie-and-tiara banquet.\n\nYes, it's me, President Trump.

The two shared a slightly awkward half handshake.\n\nAccompanied by Charles, and to a medley of American service tunes played by the band of the Grenadier Guards, Trump then inspected the guard of honour by the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards. The first couple later joined the Queen, Charles and Camilla, Prince Harry and other royals for a private lunch, also attended by Ivanka and Kushner.\n\nAs is usual, gifts were exchanged, though it transpired gifts were not Trump\u2019s forte. The Queen presented him with a first edition of The Second World War by Winston Churchill and a three-piece pen set bearing the royal cypher.\n\nBut on a tour of Royal Collection artefacts in the palace\u2019s picture gallery, Trump was also shown the pewter horse he gave the Queen on his last visit. Asked if he recognised it, he replied \u201cno\u201d , at which point Melania jumped in, saying: \u201cYes, this is one of ours.\u201d Trump did better when he was shown a book of tartans opened at the yellow design of his Scottish Hebridean mother\u2019s MacLeod clan. \u201cThat\u2019s my tartan,\u201d he said immediately.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump and the Prince of Wales. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nThe presidential plane was met at Stansted by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Even as it was taxiing in, Trump was launching his broadside against Khan, who has criticised Britain rolling out the red carpet for the visit.\n\nThe president tweeted: \u201cSadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly \u2018nasty\u2019 to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me\u201d.\n\nThe president then appeared to use some downtime at the US ambassador\u2019s residence to indulge another favourite pastime, venting his anger on Twitter on the topics of \u201cfake news\u201d, China, and the US broadcaster CNN. \u201cJust arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that CNN is the primary source of news available from the US,\u201d he tweeted before condemning it as \u201cAll negative & so much Fake News\u201d.\n\nIn the evening, he tweeted: \u201cLondon part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong. Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our Country.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen any protests yet, but I\u2019m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around. Also, big Trade Deal is possible once UK gets rid of the shackles.\u201d\n\nThe state visit is an upgrade on his previous \u201cworking visit\u201d, where he had tea with the Queen. Around 170 guests, with cultural, diplomatic and economic links with the US, will join the first couple and senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the grand ballroom at Buckingham Palace to dine off the silver gilt of the Grand Service made for George IV. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, both declined to attend.\n\nHastily offered by Theresa May after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the visit brings down the curtain on her troubled premiership. Trump was vocal ahead of his visit in criticising her handling of Brexit.\n\nGiven both, there was no surprise when it emerged on Monday that there would be no formal one-to-one between the president and the prime minister during the visit. Instead, the two will meet alongside their aides on Tuesday. Asked whether the president had preferred to hold a one-to-one meeting, May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the answer to that is no.\u201d\n\nWaving banners emblazoned with messages declaring the president was \u201cevil\u201d, scores of protesters blowing whistles and horns massed on a green outside the palace.\n\nDemonstrators, many of who were clutching signs urging people to \u201cjust say no\u201d to the special relationship, chanted: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d\n\nOutside Buckingham Palace, Weyman Bennett, 54, the co-convenor of Stand up to Racism, who helped organise the protest, said the state visit represented \u201can insult to people\u2019s basic decent values\u201d and should have been cancelled.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to say to a bully they\u2019re wrong and stand up for basic rights. He\u2019s threatened nuclear war, he\u2019s behaved like a boorish idiot, he doesn\u2019t even respect basic diplomatic values.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump inspects an honour guard at Buckingham Palace. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nBefore the banquet, the Trumps took tea at Clarence House with Charles and Camilla, and laid a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, accompanied by the Duke of York.\n\nGiven the 75th anniversary of D-day on Thursday, Trump\u2019s visit culminates on Wednesday, when he will join the Queen during commemorations in Portsmouth. He will also be escorted by May on a private tour of the Churchill War Rooms, from which Winston Churchill directed British forces during the second world war."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2019/jun/03/wwdc-apple-developer-conference-keynote-live", "published": "2019-06-03T20:11:51", "title": "Apple announces new Mac Pro at WWDC \u2013 live updates", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Supporters of the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, say she will make a decision about running after an evening conference call with grassroots activists.\n\nThe 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, which will run the contest, will hold an executive meeting on Tuesday as calls grow for changes to the rules to reduce the size of the field. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, compared the race to the Grand National and suggested changes were needed to prevent the contest from dragging on.\n\nQ&A How do the Tories elect a new leader? Show Hide A Conservative leadership contest has two stages. First, MPs vote for their choice from the nominated candidates. In each round of voting, the candidate with the least number of votes is eliminated from the contest. MPs vote again, until there are only two challengers remaining. This usually takes place over several days, and candidates often withdraw from the process if they see they have no chance of winning. The second stage is a postal ballot of Conservative party members to chose one of the two candidates, meaning around 120,000 people will choose the UK's next prime minister. Theresa May will formally resign on 7 June, and nominations to be leader are expected to close the following week. The contest should be finished by the end of July.\n\n\u201cIf you already know it\u2019s going to be a bit of a struggle to get over the first fence, let alone Becher\u2019s Brook ahead, then maybe you should pull up,\u201d he said in a speech at Policy Exchange on Monday. \u201cThere is no embarrassment in that.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the committee\u2019s executive members have suggested candidates should be required to have the support of at least 12 MPs before they can be on the ballot. Such a cut-off would eliminate a significant number of the candidates: Mark Harper, Rory Stewart, Esther McVey, James Cleverly, Andrea Leadsom, Kit Malthouse and Sam Gyimah.\n\nCleverly, a Brexit minister who is running a campaign as a new generation candidate, said the Conservative membership needed to be given \u201cthe chance to be gutsy\u201d and warned against \u201crushing\u201d the contest.\n\n\u201cThis is a real opportunity for us to properly test ideas and people and we are looking for somebody who will not only deliver Brexit but be leader of the party for years into the future and has to reach out to a lot of voters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to win the next general election and I think rushing it could be counterproductive. Investing maybe an extra five days in the process to make sure we get it right for the next five years is time well spent.\u201d\n\nOne supporter of an outsider candidate said they believed some on the 1922 Committee were trying to rig the rules in favour of Johnson, arguing it was highly unfair on some hopefuls to change the rules before any hustings had taken place to let them demonstrate their potential. But one of the leading candidates said it made sense to knock out the \u201cminnows\u201d in the race and concentrate on those who had a chance of winning.\n\nSupporters of Johnson increasingly believe the race is likely to head for a \u201cpsychodrama\u201d of a run-off between their candidate and Michael Gove, who knocked him out of the race in 2016. However, those around Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock all insist they are in with a chance of prevailing, with about 150 Conservative MPs still to say who they are backing.\n\nIn Johnson\u2019s video, released on Monday morning, he meets voters and promises one former Conservative voter that he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson in his campaign video. Photograph: Twitter\n\nThe video expresses support for increased education funding and police numbers and shows Johnson agreeing with a voter on the need for more stop and search.\n\nThe launch was not entirely without a hitch. Johnson was criticised for claiming that crime in London went down 20% while he was mayor. The Liberal Democrats pointed to official government figures suggesting police-recorded crime in London fell by 15% from 2007-08 to 2015-16. Ed Davey, a Lib Dem leadership candidate, said: \u201cFor Johnson to kick off his leadership campaign with a lie is at least very on-brand.\u201d\n\nLiz Truss, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, who had been considering a run at the leadership herself, was the first of the current cabinet to endorse Johnson over the weekend.\n\nIt is believed unlikely that Johnson will secure the backing of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd \u2013 a joint ticket that had been nicknamed \u201cBamber\u201d \u2013 because of Rudd\u2019s discomfort at serving in a cabinet that could pursue a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOther prominent names backing Johnson include the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former defence secretary Gavin Williamson and the backbencher Zac Goldsmith."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/03/swedish-court-rejects-request-to-detain-julian-assange", "published": "2019-06-03T19:06:26", "title": "Swedish court rejects request to detain Julian Assange", "text": "An attempt to extradite Julian Assange to Sweden has suffered a setback after a court in Uppsala said he did not need to be detained.\n\nThe ruling by the district court prevents Swedish prosecutors from applying immediately for an extradition warrant for Assange to face an allegation of rape dating back to 2010. Assange denies the accusation.\n\nAssange is serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden.\n\nSwedish prosecutors dropped their rape investigation in 2017 but reopened it after Ecuador rescinded its grant of asylum to Assange in April this year and allowed British police to arrest him.\n\nThe 47-year-old Australian was too ill to appear last week at the latest hearing at Westminster magistrates court in relation to a rival US extradition request.\n\nUS government lawyers are seeking his removal to the US where he is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. He also faces additional charges of violating the Espionage Act by publishing classified information through WikiLeaks.\n\nIf both Sweden and the US present competing extradition requests, it will be up to the UK home secretary, Sajid Javid, to decide which application takes priority.\n\nAt the Swedish court on Monday, a judgment was read out saying that since Assange was already in a British prison he did not need to be formally detained to be questioned by Swedish prosecutors.\n\n\u201cAs Julian Assange is currently serving a prison sentence, the investigation can proceed with the help of a European investigation order, which does not require Julian Assange\u2019s detention (in Sweden).

So there is no point detaining him in Sweden too,\u201d Samuelson said.\n\nResponding to the ruling, the Swedish prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson said: \u201cThe investigation continues with interviews in Sweden.

Experts believe Chinese Communist Party police and soldiers killed hundreds, if not thousands, of protesters demanding liberal democracy, inspired by the impending fall of the Soviet Union and similar protests nationwide. Until this year, China had largely ignored the anniversary of the protests, censoring all mention of it on the Chinese internet.\n\nIn a sign of potentially admitting defeat \u2013 or being comfortable enough with its repression to not fear inspiring outrage \u2013 Wei answered a question about Tiananmen, defending the incident, and China\u2019s state-run newspaper Global Times published an article celebrating the \u201cincident.\u201d\n\nWei spoke at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global defense forum.\n\n\u201cThat incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence which is a correct policy,\u201d he said in response to a question about the anniversary of the massacre. \u201cThe 30 years have proven that China has undergone major changes China has enjoyed stability and development.\u201d\n\nWei reportedly questioned why the world frowned upon China killing hundreds of its citizens, according to Agence France-Presse, and recommended that critics \u201cvisit China\u201d to \u201cbetter understand\u201d why the Communist Party chose the mode of action it did.\n\nChina has invested years of time and energy into erasing the Tiananmen Square massacre. Extensive censorship online redirects or blocks searches for the event, schools do not teach it, and commemorating those killed in public could lead to severe police retribution. Chinese officials closely monitor social media to preemptively block any content educating readers about the killings. As of 2015, only 15 of 100 students surveyed could identify the photo known as \u201ctank man\u201d \u2013 the iconic image of a Chinese protester standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen Square. China has never allowed the public to identify the man or revealed his fate.\n\nThis year, however, the Chinese Communist Party is going on the offensive, claiming the crackdown was necessary to preserve communism and only enemies of the Chinese state support such popular uprisings. In addition to Wei\u2019s comments, the Global Times published an editorial Sunday defending the killings and their subsequent censorship.\n\n\u201cWe consider such practice a political success, although some people have criticized it from the perspective of news governance. Merely afflicting China once, the incident has not become a long-term nightmare for the country,\u201d the Times claimed. \u201cNeither has the incident\u2019s anniversary ever been placed in the teeth of the storm. It has become a faded historical event, rather than an actual entanglement.\u201d\n\nThe Times column goes on to praise China for being too \u201cmature\u201d to have a repeat of the protests and state that the incident was a \u201cvaccination\u201d for China against \u201cmajor political turmoil.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Tiananmen Square killings, Wei defended the modern use of concentration camps to torture and enslave the nation\u2019s Uighur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz Muslim minorities. The Pentagon estimates that China has imprisoned as many as 3 million people in the camps, where they are forced to memorize communist propaganda songs, learn Mandarin, worship Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, and make cheap clothing in sweatshops.\n\nChinese officials call the camps \u201cvocational training centers,\u201d claiming that they send individuals there to learn skills necessary to be competitive in the Chinese economy. Without that training, authorities claim, Muslims are naturally susceptible to joining jihadist groups. Relatives of the imprisoned say many are highly educated, held stable jobs, and had no need for such training before being imprisoned.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s policy in Xinjiang is absolutely right,\u201d Wei said in Singapore. \u201cVocational education ensures there are no terrorist attacks \u2026 Over the past more than two years there has not been a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang.\u201d\n\nWei also addressed China\u2019s growing belligerence against Taiwan and threatened military action to colonize it.\n\n\u201cThe Taiwan question bears on China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Not a single country in the world would tolerate secession,\u201d Wei said. \u201cI visited the US last year. American friends told me that Abraham Lincoln was the greatest American president because he led the country to victory in the Civil War and prevented the secession of the US. The US is indivisible, so is China. China must be and will be reunified. We find no excuse not to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone dares to split Taiwan from China,\u201d he warned, \u201cthe Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national unity.\u201d\n\nTaiwan has been a sovereign state operation outside of Beijing\u2019s control since 1945.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2019/06/03/chinese-defense-minister-tiananmen-square-massacre-was-correct-policy/", "published": "2019-06-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Illegals Get Minimum Sentences for Killing Couple, Raping 12-Year-Old", "text": "Two illegal aliens received prison sentences of 12 to 2o years, one for killing a young couple in a sanctuary city and another for raping a 12-year-old girl.\n\nThe Angel Family of 34-year-old Logan Wilson and his wife 32-year-old Jessica Wilson is outraged after an illegal alien was sentenced to just 12 years in prison after killing the young couple in a drunk driving crash in August 2018 in the sanctuary city of Marion County, Oregon.\n\nWeeks ago, illegal alien Eduardo de la Lima Vargas from Mexico received a sentence of 12 years after killing the Wilsons, leaving their three young children now without parents, in a drunk driving crash where the couple\u2019s motorcycle was wedged under the illegal alien\u2019s pickup truck, Breitbart News originally reported.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Lima Vargas was driving with a blood-alcohol level of .10 percent when he hit and killed Logan and Jessica Wilson.\n\nIn interviews with the Statesman Journal last month, the family expressed their dissatisfaction with the sentencing of Lima Vargas:\n\nFamily members of the victims said the fact that De La Lima-Vargas would be housed and fed by the government and allowed to see his family while incarcerated felt like a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d [Emphasis added] \u2026 Logan\u2019s sister Mariah Turnidge called De La Lima-Vargas an \u201cincredibly selfish, immoral person.\u201d She said he could\u2019ve called a cab or slept in his vehicle the night of the crash.

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nFor decades, Canada\u2019s indigenous people have warned that a disproportionately large number of their women and girls were vanishing or being killed, that police investigations of these crimes were careless, and that their pleas for help were being ignored.\n\nOn Monday, the government-appointed commission that has been investigating the claims announced its explosive conclusion: Canada\u2019s indigenous women and girls are \u201cunder siege,\u201d and their deaths and disappearances amount to \u201ca race-based genocide.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its final report at a morning ceremony in Gatineau, Quebec, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and family members of victims.\n\n\u201cGenocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions and actions detailed within this report,\u201d the commission concluded. It laid out in detail over more than 1,200 pages how a mix of \u201cappalling apathy\u201d and \u201ccolonialist structures\u201d has fueled a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d centuries in the making.\n\n\u201cThis is not what Canada is supposed to be about,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cIt is not what it purports to stand for.\u201d\n\nThe commission itself has drawn criticism for staff turnover and an alleged lack of transparency. Critics say the process won\u2019t bring justice because the panel wasn\u2019t granted the authority to compel police to reopen cold cases.\n\n[Canada\u2019s inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women gets a failing grade]\n\nTrudeau, who promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with its 1.6 million indigenous people, launched the $92 million inquiry shortly after assuming office in 2015.\n\n\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie take part in a moment of silence during the ceremony. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day,\u201d he said Monday. He promised to review the report and to implement a plan. The report \u201cwill not be placed on a shelf to collect dust,\u201d he promised, to applause.\n\nThe commission, headed by Marion Buller, British Columbia\u2019s first female indigenous judge, crisscrossed the country for more than two years to take testimony from roughly 2,400 witnesses, including survivors and family members of victims.\n\nThey described the bodies of sisters, mothers and daughters being dredged out of rivers or found along a desolate stretch of highway in British Columbia where so many indigenous women and girls have disappeared or been killed that it\u2019s called the \u201cHighway of Tears.\u201d\n\nWitnesses told the commission that police were slow to launch missing-persons investigations and quick to label unexplained deaths as drownings, suicides or drug overdoses, even when evidence suggested foul play.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 1,181 cases of murdered or missing indigenous women and girls from 1980 to 2012. Indigenous women are six times as likely to be victims of homicide than non-indigenous women, the government agency Statistics Canada reported in 2017.\n\nBut those figures could be a gross undercount, according to the commission, which concluded that \u201cno one knows the exact number\u201d because thousands of deaths and disappearances \u201chave likely gone unrecorded.\u201d\n\nThe commission concluded that colonial violence, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia against indigenous women and girls have become so woven into the fabric of their lives that many have become accustomed to it.\n\n\n\nTrudeau holds the final report. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nContributing to the violence, the commission said, are historical trauma from government-directed family separation policies, residential schools and land dispossession; social and economic marginalization; and a lack of willingness among Canadian institutions to change.\n\n[The mystery of 1,000 missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada]\n\nAn \u201cabsolute paradigm shift\u201d is needed \u201cto dismantle colonialism within Canadian society,\u201d the commission said.\n\nAmong its 231 recommendations, the commission advised creating an independent task force to investigate unresolved cases, increasing punishments for violent offenses when the victims are indigenous women, and granting indigenous languages the same official status as English and French.\n\n\u201cToday, we hold up a mirror to Canada,\u201d Buller said. She said the report\u2019s action items were not just \u201crecommendations\u201d but \u201clegal imperatives.\u201d\n\nTrudeau promised change.\n\n\u201cI know and you know that we need to fix the way things work in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must continue to decolonize our existing structures, and the racism, sexism and economic inequality that has allowed such violence against indigenous women and girls to prevail must be eradicated.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s indigenous people long called for a probe into missing and slain women and girls. Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, said the issue had been \u201cstudied to death\u201d and was not \u201creally high\u201d on his government\u2019s \u201cradar.\u201d\n\n\n\nJenny Blackbird of Kehewin Cree Nation in Alberta raises a cup of sacred water as hundreds gather in Toronto in honor of Tina Fontaine, who was found killed 2014. (Bernard Weil/Toronto Star via Getty Images)\n\nThe death in 2014 of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, whose body was found in a Manitoba river wrapped in a blanket and weighed down with rocks, galvanized public attention. In the 24 hours before her death, she met with social workers, police and emergency room doctors, but no one kept her safe.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this national inquiry is happening now doesn\u2019t mean that indigenous people waited this long to speak up,\u201d the commission said. \u201cIt means it took this long for Canada to listen.\u201d\n\nNot everyone felt heard.\n\nDanielle Ewenin said she attended a commission hearing in Saskatchewan in 2017 to testify about her sister.\n\nEleanor \u201cLaney\u201d Ewenin was found dead in a field on the outskirts of Calgary in 1982 at age 23. Police filed a report under an incorrect name; the case remains unsolved.\n\nEwenin said she decided to testify because she \u201cwanted to make a difference for indigenous women.\u201d But, she said, the inquiry operated under a patriarchal and colonial model that was not responsive to families, and its \u201cmismanagement, bungling, ineptness and incompetence\u201d doomed it to fail.\n\nEwenin said frequent calls to her caseworker, responsible for helping her track down police and coroner\u2019s reports, went unanswered. She eventually obtained the records herself, she said, but was told it was too late to include them in the inquiry\u2019s forensic audit of police files.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time disassociating myself from my feelings of anger and betrayal and injustice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did not find or honor the truth with my sister.\u201d\n\n\n\nA woman holds a sign during the ceremony in Gatineau. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\n\n\nWomen march into the ceremony. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nCalls from family members of victims to reset the inquiry in 2017 went unheeded.\n\nBuller told The Washington Post last year that the commission had struggled with communicating with families. She blamed early missteps on bureaucratic challenges and the initial two-year deadline. (Buller requested a two-year extension. The government granted six more months.)\n\nIn a foreword to the report, Buller criticized the government for failing to grant the full extension, saying \u201cmany truths\u201d will go \u201cunspoken and unknown\u201d as a result.\n\nThe commission said the additional time would have allowed the forensic audit team to look at more files, such as those pertaining to Ewenin\u2019s sister.\n\nThe commission said police blamed victims and employed racist stereotypes in interactions with indigenous women. It singled out the RCMP for failing to provide all of the files it subpoenaed.\n\nAnita Ross testified before the commission in Thunder Bay, Ontario, about the death of her 16-year-old daughter. Delaine Copenace went missing in 2016 and was found dead weeks later in a lake near her home. Police were late to investigate her disappearance, Ross said, and labeled her death an accidental drowning \u2014 a conclusion she rejects.\n\nRoss watched the ceremony on television. She was glad to see Trudeau attending with his wife, she said, and was \u201ctrying to feel optimistic.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether the government will act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hopeful, but we\u2019re just wondering if it will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say things, but will they follow through?\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nCanadian police force slammed for handling of dozens of indigenous deaths\n\nThe latest front in Canada\u2019s effort to reconcile with indigenous Canadians: Language\n\n\u2018Third World conditions\u2019: Many of Canada\u2019s indigenous people can\u2019t drink the water at home\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/trump-tells-israelis-to-get-their-act-together-as-country-gears-up-for-second-election-this-year/2019/06/03/c717fe76-85e5-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html", "published": "2019-06-03T13:09:36", "title": "Trump tells Israelis to \u2018get their act together,\u2019 as country gears up for second election this year", "text": "As President Trump left Washington on Sunday for a three-day visit to Britain, he aired his frustrations that Israel is heading to a second general election less than two months after the last one, further roiling an already turbulent Israeli political scene.\n\n\u201cI mean, that came out of the blue three days ago.

But they also leave Trump\u2019s much-touted peace plan in limbo.\n\nThe president\u2019s Middle East envoy, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former lawyer Jason Greenblatt, planned to begin the first stage of the rollout of the long-awaited plan immediately after Israel's elections and the formation of a new government.\n\nThe first stage, an economic workshop to build support for the financial aspects of the plan, is scheduled to take place in late June, with the political portion expected to follow quickly.\n\nWith a second Israeli election campaign now in progress, that appears increasingly unlikely, although U.S. officials have said the Bahrain conference will go ahead as planned.\n\nBut even some in the administration appear to have little hope that it can succeed at all. On Sunday, The Post published an audio recording revealing that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had serious doubts about the prospects for the forthcoming peace plan.\n\n[Exclusive: Pompeo delivers unfiltered view of Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan in off-the-record meeting]\n\nSpeaking at a meeting on Tuesday of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a New York-based group that addresses concerns of the Jewish community, Pompeo said that some might describe the plan as \"unexecutable.\" He also said the administration had prepared for the eventuality that the plan does not gain traction and that Israel begins annexing parts of the West Bank anyway.\n\nThe plan to solve a decades-old intractable conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has also been overshadowed by a crisis in diplomatic relations between the United States and the Palestinians. The current U.S. administration has taken actions vehemently opposed by the Palestinians, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital without a final-status agreement, cutting funding to the Palestinian Authority and the U.N. refugee agency that serves it, forcing the Palestinian Authority\u2019s diplomatic office in Washington to close, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\n\nThe announcement last month that the anticipated peace process would begin with the economic forum in Bahrain was met with hostility by the Palestinian leadership. In comments last week in Ramallah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the conference could go to hell.\n\n\u201cThe Palestinian Authority does not recognize this conference,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his comments to the press on Sunday, Trump said he still thought there was a chance for peace.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what happens. I mean, look, we're doing our best to help the Middle East to get a peace plan,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd he may be right. I mean, most people would say that.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a sobering assessment of the prospects of the Trump administration\u2019s long-awaited Middle East peace plan in a closed-door meeting with Jewish leaders, saying \u201cone might argue\u201d that the plan is \u201cunexecutable\u201d and it might not \u201cgain traction.\u201d He expressed his hope that the deal isn\u2019t simply dismissed out of hand.\n\n\u201cIt may be rejected. Could be in the end, folks will say, \u2018It\u2019s not particularly original, it doesn\u2019t particularly work for me,\u2019 that is, \u2018It\u2019s got two good things and nine bad things, I\u2019m out,\u2019 \u201d Pompeo said in an audio recording of the private meeting obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThe big question is can we get enough space that we can have a real conversation about how to build this out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe remarks are the most unvarnished comments to date from a U.S. official about President Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century,\u201d an effort to resolve the intractable Israeli-Palestinian dispute he has entrusted to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former lawyer Jason Greenblatt.\n\nThe unveiling of the plan has been repeatedly delayed, a point Pompeo noted.\n\n\u201cThis has taken us longer to roll out our plan than I had originally thought it might \u2014 to put it lightly,\u201d he said at a meeting on Tuesday of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a New York-based group that addresses concerns of the Jewish community.\n\nIn trying to manage expectations, he said there are \u201cno guarantees that we\u2019re the ones that unlock it,\u201d he said, referring to the frozen conflict. \u201cI hope everyone will engage in a serious way.\u201d\n\nHe also recognized the popular notion that the agreement will be one-sided in favor of the Israeli government. \u201cI get why people think this is going to be a deal that only the Israelis could love,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the perception of that. I hope everyone will just give the space to listen and let it settle in a little bit.\u201d\n\nSince the U.S. president announced plans to solve the decades-old conflict, the United States has taken actions vehemently opposed by the Palestinians, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital without a final-status agreement, cutting funding to the Palestinian Authority and the U.N. refugee agency that serves it, forcing its diplomatic office in Washington to close, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\n\nTwo attendees said they left with the impression that Pompeo was not optimistic the plan would succeed. \u201cHe was not in any way confident that the process would lead to a successful conclusion,\u201d said one of the attendees, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms of the meeting were off the record.\n\nElan Carr, the State Department\u2019s special envoy to combat anti-Semitism who also attended the meeting, expressed a different view, saying he thought Pompeo \u201cprovided a hopeful assessment over the prospect of a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an excellent briefing that was very well received by the conference,\u201d he said in a statement offered by the State Department.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former negotiator and analyst on Middle East issues for both Republican and Democratic administrations, said the remarks were \u201cthe most revealing and real assessment of the plan that I\u2019ve heard so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Pompeo so easily conceded the perception \u2014 and likely the reality \u2014 that the plan was strongly structured and tilted toward the Israelis is striking,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe CEO of the group that hosted the event, Malcolm Hoenlein, said he thought Pompeo\u2019s remarks reflected his awareness of allegations of a pro-Israel bias but not the secretary\u2019s own view of the plan. \u201cHe was saying it\u2019s too easy to fall into the trap of these negative assessments,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo, unlike previous secretaries of state, is not overseeing the peace effort, but he told the group he is kept closely abreast of the proposal, including a game plan for what to do if Israel proceeds to annex territory in the West Bank. \u201cI have seen what I believe are all of the details of what it is we are going to roll out,\u201d he said.\n\nKushner, a real estate scion from New Jersey, and Greenblatt, the former chief legal officer for Trump and the Trump Organization, have led the initiative since the president took power. The two men, both practicing Orthodox Jews, did not come in with political experience but have shared a long interest in and connection to Israel.\n\nPompeo said the administration never believed achieving a lasting peace agreement would be easy. \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusions [that] we\u2019re going to show up with this thing and everyone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Tell me where to go for the signing ceremony,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nIf the peace plan had appeared to be an uphill battle when Pompeo spoke Tuesday night, it hit another significant hurdle just a day later as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition and Israel\u2019s parliament voted to dissolve itself, sending the country back to elections in September.\n\nNow, if the White House wants to avoid rolling out a peace plan during a sensitive election campaign period for Netanyahu, it will have to wait until at least November, when a new Israeli government is expected to be formed. By that time, the Trump administration will be stepping up its own reelection campaign.\n\nPompeo said the State Department had given \u201cquite a bit of consideration\u201d to what it would do if the plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t gain traction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to call it failing,\u201d he said. \u201cCall it whatever. I fail a lot, so it\u2019s not about not using a word like that.\u201d\n\nThe contingency planning includes how to respond if the Israeli government decides to annex territory in the West Bank, a move many believe would be a final death knell to a two-state solution.\n\nAs part of his election campaign, Netanyahu pledged to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he won, a move considered illegal by much of the international community. He also may face pressure from right-wing coalition partners to take advantage of the remaining time before the next U.S. election.\n\nA peace plan that lays down Israel\u2019s right to sovereignty over certain areas of the West Bank could bolster calls from those pushing for annexation.\n\nIf Israel did go ahead with annexation, the administration would then consider \u201cwhat would be the best ways to achieve the outcomes that we think are in America and Israel\u2019s best interests,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nAfter a participant asked whether there was any effort to bring the Palestinians on board, Pompeo responded that \u201ceveryone will find something to hate about the proposal\u201d but that everyone, including the Palestinians, \u201cwill find something that they say that\u2019s something to build upon.\u201d\n\nPalestinian officials see the White House plan as inevitably biased against them. In a speech broadcast on Palestine TV recently, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that both the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d and the Trump administration's upcoming economic summit for the Palestinians in Bahrain could \u201cgo to hell.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the Bahrain summit is to drum up support for the economic component of the administration\u2019s peace plan without getting bogged down in the more contentious territorial issues.\n\nAbbas has said Palestinian officials will boycott the summit.\n\nPompeo said if Kuwait signs up, all the Persian Gulf states will be represented in Bahrain \u201cto at least come to listen.\u201d He said it was hard to expect gulf nations to come out in \u201cfull-throated support\u201d for the process when they haven\u2019t seen the whole plan.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration\u2019s approach have picked up on the fact that the economic summit is not being held in tandem with political discussions.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do serious economic development without resolving the security and political issues that allow investors and internal economic growth and employment,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMorris reported from Jerusalem."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/purged-not-purged-leading-north-korean-official-re-emerges-in-public/2019/06/03/fbb55d02-85f6-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html", "published": "2019-06-03T14:16:00", "title": "Purged? Not purged. Leading North Korean official reemerges in public.", "text": "People watch a TV screen showing an image of senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol attending a musical performance in North Korea during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station on June 3. (Ahn Young-Joon/AP)\n\nA senior official who was reported last week as being the victim of a purge in North Korea has reappeared in public sitting not far from the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe reemergence of Kim Yong Chol, a powerful, hard-line former spy chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s counterpart in talks with the United States, underlines how opaque the North Korean regime remains to the outside world.\n\nIt also is a reminder of how little outsiders know about how Kim Jong Un reacted to the breakdown of his recent summit with President Trump.\n\nRumors of Kim Yong Chol\u2019s demotion have circulated since last month, when he did not accompany Kim Jong Un to Vladivostok to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, an unusual occurrence for a man who is normally not far from his leader\u2019s side on international trips.\n\nSouth Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported Friday that he had been sentenced to hard labor and ideological reeducation as punishment for the failure of the summit with Trump in Hanoi in late February.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that Kim Hyok Chol, the counterpart of U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun in pre-summit negotiations, had been executed, although many diplomats and experts expressed caution or outright skepticism about that claim.\n\nNow, North Korean state media have shown Kim Yong Chol, sitting five seats down from Kim Jong Un at an event where the wives of military officers gave an artistic performance. While everyone else was applauding, Kim Yong Chol was shown with his hands on his face, although he was easily recognizable.\n\n[Was a North Korean official executed? Mystery may cloud new talks with the U.S.]\n\nRachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with the North Korea-focused website NK Pro, said Kim Yong Chol was named among the attendees as his position in the Politburo would merit, implying no formal demotion in rank \u2014 10th among the 12 officials listed in order of seniority.\n\nBut Lee said the fact that Kim Yong Chol did not accompany his leader to Russia \u2014 and that he earlier reportedly had been replaced as head of the United Front Department, a ruling-party body in charge of ties with South Korea \u2014 implied \u201ca demotion in a way.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Kim Yong Chol had been purged also appeared to be contradicted by him being listed as having been reelected to the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, the country\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, and to the State Affairs Commission, a key decision-making body, in mid-April, the NK News website, the sister site to NK Pro, pointed out.\n\nKim Hyok Chol, meanwhile, has not been seen in public since the Hanoi summit, although some experts say it would make little sense for Kim Jong Un to order his execution after going to great lengths to try to build up his own image as a global statesman.\n\nIf he imposed such a harsh punishment purely to have a scapegoat, no one within the regime would \u201cdare engage in negotiations with the outside world anymore,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang of South Korea\u2019s Sejong Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely for Kim to wield such an extreme punishment unless he has given up on talks with the United States.\u201d\n\nCheong also said Kim Hyok Chol was seen on April 13, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Kim Jong Un turns to purges and fear politics to solidify his absolute power,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not sensible at all to conclude an official has been purged because of prolonged absence from the public eye, given how many of them turned out to have been temporary demotions or personnel shake-ups, especially when basing it on \u2018North Korean sources,\u2019 which are difficult to have confidence in.\u201d\n\nBut the appearance of Kim Yong Chol was not the only surreal scene in the theater in Pyongyang over the weekend.\n\nWhat had Kim Yong Un and his entourage applauding so enthusiastically was a musical performance by the wives of military officers, in which they sang about how they \u201cmake every moment of their lives honorable with ardent yearning for the leader and boundless loyalty to him.\u201d\n\nPieces included \u201cYearning,\u201d as well as a chorus performance of \u201cOur Leader Loved by People,\u201d an accordion ensemble and chorus of \u201cOur National Flag,\u201d a chorus performance of \u201cArdent Desire,\u201d an instrumental trio ensemble of \u201cBeautiful Vapor Trail\u201d and a national instrumental ensemble of \u201cOur Socialism Is the Best in the World.\u201d\n\nThe state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that \u201cthe performance was highly acclaimed by the audience for successfully showing that the defense line of the country is impregnable as long as there is a large unit of women revolutionaries who bear in mind the great trust and expectation of the Party Central Committee and add dynamism to the revolution with love and devotion.\u201d\n\nDenyer reported from Hokkaido, Japan.\n\nRead more:\n\nAbsence of key North Korean negotiator at Russia summit offers glimmer of hope\n\nWhy a South Korean newspaper asked experts to look at photos of Kim Jong Un\u2019s shoes\n\nTrump appears to contradict Bolton on North Korea, expresses \u2018confidence\u2019 in Kim\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}]}}}
